They include : -Current Accounts facilities -Savings Account facilities - Money Transfer ( However ; I highly recommend using the bank transfer only in emergency cases . There are money transfer agents which offer better exchange rates ; and lower service fees ) - Tie-ups with any bank in your home country to ease transfers	Good	Good	U979	Speedysid	2013-05-03 12:58:13

Q268	Good Bank	Which is a good bank as per your experience in Doha	Q268_R13	Moving to Qatar	Which is the best bank around ? ?	Hi everybody ; I need to open a bank account as soon as possible . Can you please advise on the best bank to deal with here ? Thanks	PerfectMatch	U4909	msmay	13	2007-06-27 15:38:30	Q268_R13_C10	Well I think it’s a rip off . No such thing as the best bank . I left Doha Bank because of poor customer service and went to QNB which am happy with . With QNB ; you have to have a minimum of Qr 3 ; 000 in your current account always . It’s a compulsory savings scheme . Plus ; you get .25 % in your savings account and if you take out a mortgage loan you pay 8.5 % . Be careful ; read the small prints . I do n't trust banks here .

My needs are : -Free Current account with no minimum balance with 2 debit card -Good credit card with airport lounge and added benefit -0 % payment plan at good retaillers -Excellent mobile and internet banking -Cheap ATM and transfer for abroad ...

Do n't be amused by this word ( The World 's Local Bank ) ; they are right in it 's local ; but it 's not universal . you can ask them about something to do with another HSBC world wide ; they will tell you : sorry ; there is no networks between our banks in the world ; so it 's just local bank . I 'm telling you this ; since I 'm dealing with five different bank in Qatar ; and HSBC was even lower level than others ; it 's just a big name ; the only good thing about them ; that they provide you parking in the main branch in Banks street . I think Doha ; Almashreq ; and the commercial banks are better options . Best regards	PotentiallyUseful	Good	U2466	oabazeed	2008-05-10 04:02:28

If your really lucky turtles . Anywhere north of Ras Laffan should be good . I was at Umm Tais Natural Reserves ( mentioned in post above - turn right at Al-Shammal and head east ; first island is Ras Rakkan and is harder to get to ; go past until a hamlet and past this you can access Umm Tais ) a few weeks ago ; interesting place but Fuwarait is easier to get to etc . `` `` Sandy '' '' beach we used to go to ; Al-Dhakriah mangroves . There is generally less to see on west coast than the east coast unless you go to places near construction which for the east coast is now a lot ! ! Hence i recommend French beach / fuwarait . There are also a few nice locations you can snorkell in the inland sea ; although currents at certain times are very very strong . GO past coastguard station at mouth and head along towards Saudi until you see obvious shallows . ''	Good	Good	U1074	Cnidaria	2008-05-28 10:00:32

I have enjoyed many visits to the island ; and was under the illusion that it was there for everyone to enjoy . I could be wrong ; but it would seem that it is probably going to be out of bounds to casual visitors in future . On the flip side ; the island is man made . So I guess whoever made it must have had a good reason to pop an island right next to a massive new shiny international airport ; and this is probably it .

I was at Umm Tais Natural Reserves ( mentioned in post above - turn right at Al-Shammal and head east ; first island is Ras Rakkan and is harder to get to ; go past until a hamlet and past this you can access Umm Tais ) a few weeks ago ; interesting place but Fuwarait is easier to get to etc . `` `` Sandy '' '' beach we used to go to ; Al-Dhakriah mangroves . There is generally less to see on west coast than the east coast unless you go to places near construction which for the east coast is now a lot ! ! Hence i recommend French beach / fuwarait . There are also a few nice locations you can snorkell in the inland sea ; although currents at certain times are very very strong . GO past coastguard station at mouth and head along towards Saudi until you see obvious shallows . ''	PotentiallyUseful	Good	U1074	Cnidaria	2008-05-28 10:00:32

If you are western I would say you wont save much out of 20k ; you would want a decent apartment / villa ; good social life ; weekends away . If you are the sort of person who is just coming here to work work work ; then you will be able to save more .

If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates . For them everything is double . - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle . For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser ; beautician ; etc . usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene .

We are talking about a city of over 12million where the traffic is so bad ( if you think Doha is bad ... just wait ) its actually comical . There is also no system and it is one of the most frustrating places to live in . Hope you are based in Zamalek or Maadi which are the nicest parts . But the lack of a system and the 'pushiness ' of the egyptians will make you angry and frustrated.The poverty is also striking . And yet ; and yet ; in one street of Cairo you will find more charm ; more magic and more life than the whole of Doha . It is a crazy place but a place which loves music and a place which is confident of itself ( not surprising given its ancient history ) . It has the soul which Doha so lacks and because of that you put up with the traffic and frustrations .

My husband and I love being at home ; we prefer high rises with a nice gym though given we are bringing motorcycles over I am thinking somthingh is a garage might be best . We have no kids so schools and having other kids around us is not a top priority . Given this ; which areas/buildings would you guys recommend ? We do n't want to commute more than say 30-40 minutes each way if we can help it ( to and from new DOHA airport ) . What information is there out there about the Pearl ; I imagine is still is mostly a huge construction site but are there finished buildigns there worth commuting to and from ?

What you see is not what you 'll get . Lusail is a `` '' planned new city '' '' due to open soon but you go there now ; all you 'll se is an empty desert land with maybe 2 tower cranes . Pearl is nearly completed but with a lot of infrastructure and other nature problems . Both locations are at the north outskirts limits of the city ; while the new airport is being built at the southern outskirt limit of the city . You do have to across the whole city and the traffic here is another nightmare ( not only the traffic jams but also the aggressive and risk driving local style ) . If no traffic ; it will be a 20-30 minutes drive . The best location for you would be near by the Marriott Hotel .

Q272_R8	Salary and Allowances	QP offer negotiation	Hi all ; I 've finally received the official offer from QP and I think I 'm being lowballed . The offer is QR23 ; 000 + 14 ; 200 housing and school and benefits . They put me in grade 16 . I do n't know anything about these grades . Can anyone enlight me and tell me also how much I can negotiate ? I read some mixed discussions about the leeway I have for negotiation . I was expecting QR35 ; 000 basic ; realistic ? . Thx in advance	Relevant	U1453	dono	8	2012-02-29 02:08:47	Q272_R8_C3	Realisticly you are making $ 6 ; 300 per month ; with paid accommodation and free children 's education etc etc . I do n't see how you are being low balled when the majority of your basic income is going to be savings because your overheads are being paid for by QP already . Even if your current job position you are making more then $ 6300 ; the chances of saving anything are highly unlikely . Also remember their are promotions ; yearly appraisals and the big fat bonus 's every year . If you do the annual gross income on your basic salary with the above you could be pulling easily 28 ; 000-30 ; 000 per month : ) Do n't miss this opportunity ! ! Most ppl on QL dream to have a offer like this ! ! Good luck !	PotentiallyUseful	Good	U3700	jaiditsol	2012-02-29 09:21:30

They have hundreds of applicants looking to join QP . That salary is a lower end of grade 16 . Normally there is no promotion in QP unless you are a Qatari or someone within GCC and you do get bonuses depending on your rating . Your annual bonus for an everage rating on your salary is around 34000 QAR and after 4 years you get 6000 QAR furniture maintenance annually . On top of the salary they will give you an expatriate allowance of about 3000 per month depending on which european country you come from and a car allowance of QAR 2000.00 per month . So basically its not bad .	PotentiallyUseful	Good	U3701	harrisonk	2012-02-29 09:35:49

US/UK schools here will cost you north of QAR 40K annually ... .and that is for PRE-K ! ! ! ! As to whether they are low-balling you ; maybe . But without knowing details of your qualifications ; current pay etc its hard to tell.Take into consideration the point I 've made about schooling expense and those made by others on this thread . That said ; I will say there is always room for a counter-offer.Just be smart with the number you go backto them with.Also depends on how much of a hard-ass the person you are dealing with is and at this point ; I would imagine you have some idea .

If you are a professional ( engineer ) with years of experience and a senior management position ; it 's garbage . One note - school fees and housing ( depending on where and how you wish to live ) can be very expensive . Do some research on school fees and look at ads for the type of housing you would find satisfactory .

I have explained this earlier and I will repeat it again..so that no one gets caught in an uncomfortable situation ... .Getting an offer and submitting a medical in QP is NOT a signal to move ... Until you get the final offer letter and see the visa in your Inbox..DO NOT RESIGN..I am sure in their Email offer to you they will advise you not to resign until told ... In QP things move according to your mobilization date..and getting your VISA is not a big deal for QP ... However the actual date of mobilization is pre-determined ... .. QP is usually too far ahead on the block before the mobilization date at times ... The next step in your recruitment process is waiting and asking questions if you have any ... Your VISA Could be ready in 1 month..or it can also be 4 months..so just wait..and DO NOT RESIGN from your current job ... .	PotentiallyUseful	Good	U1245	tg	2006-08-09 19:10:40

You can go to the private hospitals but they are much more expensive unless you have insurance that cover them . Both my kids were completely vaccinated in Doha ( born here ; now 1 and 3 ) . The only concern might be transferring the records to your home country when you return . Each country has different vaccine schedules . But ; if you are here for a while you might as well do the Doha schedule and finish it all here . For example ; in the US they do n't do BCGs ; but since I figured my kids would be here the first few years of their lives so it was probably a good idea to do it . I 'm pretty sure you do n't need all the vaccines before arriving in Doha . Check with your employer ; but I ca n't imagine they will turn away your 3 month old w/o vaccines since I know they do n't check vaccines for adults at all !

I have a 19 month old son and am very anal when it comes to car seats . Malaysia ( where I come from ) does not have car seat laws in place but I still make sure that my son travels in a car seat ; even if it 's to the nearby shops . There are many available for purchase in Malaysia but the price is far too expensive for the majority . A decent car seat could set some back two months wages . So I guess even if they are aware of the need for child car seats it is out of their reach and I guess they have other prioritoes like buying food to stay alive and having a roof over thier head . Plus families in Malaysia can have as many as 4 ( quite common ) up to 14 children . Imagine the logistical nightmare of moving the family members around ! .

Although there is no requirement or need to have any extra protection here ; it is important to remember that lots of people travel East on holidays and if you do you will need the standard typhoid ; yellow fever ; etc .

This may sound high ; but when it rains or there is a wind ; it feels much colder . I will second DaRuDe ; last year ; there was a shortage of room heaters in Qatar ; people were even willing to pay a premium for a small one . Better to be prepared than spend sleepless night shivering with the cold . Granted the cold snap does not last long ; but who would want to give up their sleep . Days are pretty warm .

November is still a nice weather ... not so hot nor cold . But on December to early February ; it will be winter and you need some winter clothes ; but not the thick ones . The jacket that we usually used on the cold rainy season will do as weather is not extremely cold in Qatar . It is still manageable . Do n't bring too much clothes ; you can buy from Qatar whenever you want to . There are clothe shops that are affordable and there is always on sale items .

I 'm pretty new here in Qatar and I 've been in search for a lap pool nearby where I can continue my training ... or at least keep myself fit . After reading several posts here ; seems like those that are easily accessible ( for a fee ) are hotel pools . As for running ; the only route I 've tried so far is at the Corniche . I usually start near the Sheraton hotel and go the opposite end then back . Biking on the other hand ... have n't tried yet as I did n't bring my bike here . My friends advised me not to since it 's not a safe place to bike - due to the hot weather and also crazy drivers on the road .

We got trapped in Doha on new years eve and were unable to get to Dukhan such was the torrential rain . It rained on and off until April and then warmed up . The coldest night was 5C but generally 7C . I remember it rained when my parents were here and that was April 2007 . This last winter was n't very cold at all ; only a few days of rain and never really got below 10C at night . I love winters here ; they are so cosy .

QAWS ( shutting down end of September ; so please consider this your first stop as they have tons of animals to rehome ) ; 2nd Chance Rescue ; Cats in Qatar ; and Qatar Veterinary Center . Look them all up on Facebook for news and pictures of their current adoptable cats . Some ask a small fee to cover money already spent on the cats spaying/neutering ; microchip and vaccination costs ; and some are completely free . 2 . Depending on the kind of cat and where you go ; it can be from 75QR to as much as 250QR for grooming . More reputable places such as the big vets ( Parkview & QVC ) will charge more . 3 .

If they do n't have the specific for persians ; they 'll probably order it for you . I think their website is www.dohavets.com or something like that . If I may suggest ; if you use an enclosed litter box ; bring one with you ; as they are very expensive here ( QR250 for a really cheap looking one ) . Also bring toys ; they are not easy to find here . And stuff like nail clipper as well . Oh ; and frontline is also quite expensive here ; and I have n't found the specific one for cats ; the vet told me to simply put less of the dog one .

We got a Saluki pup from there for our daughter and he is now a grown dog ; an absolute darling and a stress reliever for my daughter and everyone else in the house . When we got him ; he was not even a month old and his eyes were not yet foccused . I understand his parents were running wild on a farm and the cops came ; rounded them up and shot the parents ; but Paws and Claws saved many of the orphaned pups and brought them to their centre . We paid them only QR 100/-as donation for the pup . He had diarrohea and needed treatment thereafter . There are good vetinary clincs in Doha ; but still it is a bit expensive . Even then ; it is worth spending on a pup which your daughter can cuddle ; hug and love .

If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates . For them everything is double . - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle . For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser ; beautician ; etc . usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene . If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get .	Bad	PotentiallyUseful	U3873	Doha Sun	2008-07-23 15:43:56

I have a 19 month old son and am very anal when it comes to car seats . Malaysia ( where I come from ) does not have car seat laws in place but I still make sure that my son travels in a car seat ; even if it 's to the nearby shops . There are many available for purchase in Malaysia but the price is far too expensive for the majority . A decent car seat could set some back two months wages . So I guess even if they are aware of the need for child car seats it is out of their reach and I guess they have other prioritoes like buying food to stay alive and having a roof over thier head . Plus families in Malaysia can have as many as 4 ( quite common ) up to 14 children . Imagine the logistical nightmare of moving the family members around ! .

As noted above ; you insure the car ; not the driver ; which is one of the reasons kids here can afford to drive massive landcruisers ; despite the slaughter of pedestrians .

Dunno ) 3rd party is the only option . however ; and again as noted above ; cover for passengers is not automatic so check these things carefully with your Insurance Broker . Even the possibility of having residual alocohol in your bloodstream when some idiot slams into you some morning has to be specifically covered ; so it 's not a bad idea to go to a reputable international Insurance company if you think you might occasionally have non-family passengers or drink beer of an evening .

I have a 19 month old son and am very anal when it comes to car seats . Malaysia ( where I come from ) does not have car seat laws in place but I still make sure that my son travels in a car seat ; even if it 's to the nearby shops . There are many available for purchase in Malaysia but the price is far too expensive for the majority . A decent car seat could set some back two months wages . So I guess even if they are aware of the need for child car seats it is out of their reach and I guess they have other prioritoes like buying food to stay alive and having a roof over thier head . Plus families in Malaysia can have as many as 4 ( quite common ) up to 14 children . Imagine the logistical nightmare of moving the family members around ! .

Even my daughter who is four said '' '' look at that silly baby '' '' Ive not seen a collsion yet where the backend of the vehicle and rear window hasnt been smashed . Some people dont deserve to have children . I thought about taking a picture with my phone and contacting the Police ; but i think we know the possible outcome there !

Really the school authorities need to be more responsible especially when they charge way too much in terms of special fee and all when compared to other schools in Doha . The facilities tey lack and the amount of negligence shown is too much . There is no conductor in most buses ; even the ones in which small kids travel ; and even after complaining to the school many times ; there is no action . Many buses are hired and are driven by irresponsible drivers who dont care about anything . Another issue is the school building..which has been sooo long under planning and fund raising stage . What is the management of the school doing happily running their own businesses and draining all the money from the parents without giving anything back to the school.The school management should be held responsible for the extremely poor porta cabins in which they teach the junior wing and the lack of responsibility in issues r ... ..

I for one ALWAYS pack out my garbage ; always bury and disperse my campfire and practice zero impact camping and picnicking . I know many others that do the same but the amount of litter I 've seen thrown out the window of Landcruisers suggests that prevention needs to be seen as the biggest part of the solution . Please do n't try to lay guilt trips on me for these ones .

If you only want to see sea beach then Dukhan is ok . There are no sharks but there are Channa Fish at Dukhan . Beware of Channa Fish ! They are very dangerous ; especially during the onset of winter . They generally do n't attack humans ; but if they are hungry they may eat humans ! This happens especially when the Channa grows old and lazy and does n't want to hunt ; then they come near the beach to grab easy prey ( the human bathers ) . If you want to be safe from the Channa eat lots of Garlic and apply Garlic spray on your body because ; the only thing that can repulse a Channa is Garlic ! Have a nice swim at Dukhan ! Cya .

First of all ; when you live in any Arabian Gulf countries ; and thinking to buy a car ; then it is better to buy a Japanese car as first choice . However ; if you are still new in here and just started working and wants to invest your money in a car ; then buy a small Japanese Sedan/Saloon car ; as it could save you a lot of money more than any other european cars ; specailly here in the Arabian Gulf ; as there is not much of experienced good workshops to make maintinane and fix your european car in the future . SO either you go to Mitsubishi cars or Toyota ; but Nissan is the last choice as I heared that their workshop is very busy and costing more money ; so do Renault which could cost you much more than Nissan . Nevertheless ; no one is going to push you away from the car that you would love to buy ; but as an advice from a person who has been living in Qatar for 35 years and had and experince with many types of cars ; then it is better for you to think more ... ..

Also you mentioned manure ; you do n't use manure on indoor plants ; I hope you meant soil . I also use a liquid fertilizer once in a while and I save water bottles and fill with water and leave for my house plants that way the chlorine goes out and the temp is room temperature when you water once a week . Sometimes the plants you get here are not good quality when you buy them so it does n't take much to kill them . I had gardenias in the house and within a few months they had outgrown the pot ; root bound so I planted them outside in a big pot and they are great now . There is a garden club here you can join and get help and then you will know what plants are easy to grow ; like the spider plant cleans your air so its good to have as a house plant .

The red blood cells can perform this task because of the presence of hemoglobin ; the pigment that is formed when the red blood cells develop in the bone marrow . Each hemoglobin molecule is made up of a protein molecule called globin and four pigmented molecules of a compound called heme . Each heme molecule has one atom of iron ; and there are four heme molecules in a single molecule of hemoglobin ; hence ; a single molecule of hemoglobin has four atoms of iron . This structure makes it possible for one hemoglobin molecule to join with four oxygen molecules to form a substance called oxyhemoglobin . This reaction is reversible ; enabling hemoglobin to pick up oxygen when the blood is in the lungs and to release oxygen in the cells when the blood is pumped to the tissues .

There are certain chemicals and microbes that are of particular importance in desalinated water . Of these ; particular concern has been expressed regarding the presence of microbes due to blending of final waters that ; because they were derived from coastal and marine sources ; may not be adequately addressed .

Other than that ; hotels will let you use function rooms to have parties ; some will also source mini discos etc . Try also Dana Club ; Diplomatic Club etc . Depending on how large your party is ; other ideas include ; picnics ; trips to the zoo ; ice skating ( older kids ) Although you are providing the supervision and entertainment . Hope this helps .

Our company has provided us with a new 3 bed apartment and I do not know what it will be like with a 7yr old ; he is used to playing out on his bike etc ... I suppose as I will not be working I will have to keep him occupied - any good places for children to play/met etc.. We already have a copy of Marhaba which has been useful . I think Ramadan is the biggest problem at the moment . My husband has a company vehicle but I think I will have to get a car to do the school runs etc.. do you think I could hire one initially ? or lease ? Who does your husband work for . My husband is working very long hours at the moment as they are so busy - keeps him out of mischief I suppose !	Bad	Bad	U187	Chrissy	2006-10-01 16:36:44

I 've homeschooled my children ( now 10 and 12 ) their entire lives ; so I 've done pretty extensive research on homeschooling there . There is a Yahoo group for homeschoolers in Doha . http : //groups.yahoo.com/group/DohaHomeEducators/ You could start with some basic info there . It 's a pretty flexible group that meets whenever some member decides to set something up . Just about homeschooling in general : 3 is very young to begin formal schooling . I think I would focus on letting your child explore the world and reading lots of good books to her . But if you are determined ; here 's a good resource for younger kids : http : //www.fiarhq.com/B4FIVEINAROW.html If you have any other questions ; feel free to ask .

Also the number of UK qualified teachers with QTS ( Qualified Teacher Status ) is limited . You may wish to ask how many of the teachers actually have QTS compared to those that do n't . Many of the teachers are not from the UK and do so not have a background of teaching a British Curriculum . Finally ; Parkhouse only follows part of the National Curriculum of England and Wales . The rest of the curriculum is based around what is referred to as the International Curriculum ; which is created by a private company in the UK and is not endorsed by the government . This topic has been discussed a number of times previously so you may wish to do a search to get a better idea of the school . You may also wish to try other UK curriculum schools such as Doha College ; DESS ; Sherborne and the International School of London . Good luck .	Bad	Good	U1061	joe90	2010-10-26 19:13:39

ALL their teacher comply with SEC conditions on qualifications of their teachers ; otherwise they would not be able to operate ! I can confirm the vast majority of teachers at the school are British ; 2nd is South African ( excellent standard of educated teachers ) and other nationalities . The school is as british as it gets in a non-british country . The standards are extremely high . There is very positive school/parent contact and all pupils are expected to work hard ; are well disciplined ; and result focused . I am british and my children attend Park House . I would have no problem with them returning to the UK ( not likely with the current working conditions in the UK ! ) and slipping into very good schools and coping with the change . If you are typical middle class parents who discipline your children and make sure they stay on top of their studies you will reap the benefit of this school which ... ..

Not only is that wrong ; but on top of it they miss what is happening in their class . And do n't try and tell me it 's not true - I was a volunteer parent last schoolyear for Year 1 . Is this the way to save on spending more time with the children who need more reading practice ? Why not do like the French School - extra hours of tuition after school ? Last swimming competition the kids were so excited to show what they could do - instead the swimming teacher used her own son to get a better place for Park House . The amount of dissapointed faces of children was heartbreaking ! Waiting hours for nothing ? Things are far less positive then what you make them seem !

Maybe you should change schools for your kids and give those parents who would remove their right arm to put their kids into Park House their place . In the UK all primary schools ask parents to come into the lower primary classes to hear the children read . I ca n't understand what could be better than one-to-one reading . If you want to suggest a reading group after school which parents fund I am sure the school would be interested in your suggestion . In the Uk books were changed once a week - here in Park House its three times a week ; their books are set based on their individual ability into small groups if possible . The teacher hears the pupil read at least once a week . Parents are asked to participate in their child 's learning by listening to their child read at home .

For example ; are we comparing Parkhouse ( or any other school in Doha ) with fee-paying ; independent schools in the UK or are we trying to compare them with state schools in Britain ? As Parkhouse is a fee-paying school ; I would have thought that the former would be a fairer point of comparison . One person has written that the standards at Parkhouse are `` '' extremely high '' '' . Well ; if there is an acute shortage of school places ; then it stands to reason that some of the more popular schools can be very selective about who they allow in through the gates . I have not heard much about Parkhouse 's Special Educational Needs policies and I suspect that they would not want to admit SEN children because that might affect their `` '' extremely high standards '' '' . That also might explain Parkhouse 's preference for nice ; white English children . Craftyqueen has mentioned the SEC ; the Supreme Council of Education . This is a ... ..

Qatar Academy maybe the school where money is no object but the academic standards are not as impressive ; especially in Primary . Doha College is a good school but fees are high ; Primary section ws a school that merged with the existing Doha College - secondary school . DESS is also a British school here - mainly British kids . Noticed you are from the Netherlands ; there is a Shell School in Doha that has the Dutch curriculum incorporated into it . Hope that this all helps ; warning there is a huge demand for schools in Doha as the expat population is increasing more quickly than new schools can be set up - so get your children down an a waiting list ASAP .

We can recommend the school to 100 % . Our kids came from the liberal Swedish school system but have settled very well . We have visited ALL English-speaking schools in Doha ; and the only problem is that they are all full . Waitlisting and constant telephone calls to find out if something is happening is my advice . We spent 6 months before coming to Qatar to find a school ; including 2 trips to sit entrance tests . Nerve-wracking - a week before school start we knew they had a place ... .

The same can not be said of the other school I mentioned where I know that they have staff there who have no teaching qualification whatsoever and who may not have English as their native language . Most parents looking for an American education for their children would prefer the faculty to at least have English as their native tongue ; not to mention the requisite qualifications and experience Ummhamza ; calm down ; I 'm just putting the information that I have out there for the benefit of the original poster .

Yes ; I do find it quite disturbing that there are many schools in Qatar with staff with no teaching qualification . Most schools are profit making so inevitably ( sometimes big ) corners are cut and it 's always the child who loses by being given a sub-standard education . I 'm also very disappointed that the local Independent Schools have teachers teaching English who can not even speak English properly . We are letting ourselves down unecessarily .

When we shifted from UK to Doha ; we already knew that this place is generally very safe for families . To answer your question ; yes a compound villa should be plenty safe . Crime is very very low in Qatar . We have fire extinguishers & smoke alarms in our rented villa ; if you are worried about fires . Re health ; we had a good experience with the general children 's hospital when our child was sick . Lots of concerned doctors ; all tests done to ensure nothing was missed and lots of consultations with other doctors to ensure proper medication and treatment was given . Most social activities happen in the evenings when weather is cooler . You can go shopping anywhere and anytime the shops are open ; on your own or with your child ; in tshirts/shortsleeve blouses and jeans/skirt . No need for head/face coverings or your husband by your side . This is quite common for locals and expats here . Re driving ; I find that there is hardly any road courtesy ; lots of big car ... ..

I think if everyone agrees and they can support themselves ; they should n't be penalized . But I do think that children are made the unwitting partners in these situations and it can be very ; very hard on them . They do n't actually get to consent and the choice is made for them . I do n't think the West is scared at all about polygamy . They simply do n't approve of it in their societies . It 's their right ; is n't it ? Please note : Prostitution is not legalized in the US ( except in one strange county in Nevada that I have never understood ) nor is same sex marriage ; except in a very few cases .

As time progressed and the consequences form multiple partners slowly revealed itself ; std 's HIV and such ; we can conclude that this has been the right approach . Unfortunately the popularity of 'couples ' clubs ; where couples seek another couple for sexual purposes is becoming more and more popular . Prostitution in some countries is legal ; some not . As goes for me governments should legalize prostitution and register all that practice ; create labor unions and tax them over their income . Why ? This cuts the throat of crime ; represses human trafficking and serves a purpose in society . The same goes for soft-drugs .	Bad	Good	U2	anonymous	2009-06-22 15:01:19

All the bike shops around Bombay Silk Centre ( referred to above ) do n't exist anymore since much of the area ( between Mannai roundabout to Souk Wakif ) has been demolished and fenced for the upcoming DohaLand ; so do n't bother . 2 . The shop `` '' Skate Shack '' '' on Salwa Road ( on your left after the 2nd roundabout when coming from Ramada ) is good but has high end bicycles - cheapest one is QR 1700 3 . The 2 shops on the corner of TV Roundabout are low end shops - I bought a bicycle from there for QAR 450 ... obviously nothing fancy but it works for a routine entry-level recreational street/park biker like me 4 .

The lady behind honked like hell and showed her sour face through the window . Somehow I managed to reach my house..I feel pity for these drivers as they are very new to this place and desperate to make a living . Hope it goes well after sometime without too many casualities ... The taxi was new and clean . The driver was courteous and very obliging.He only took 10 Riyals ; where Karawa guys take 12- 15 Riyals . I welcome Million Taxi ; with all its faults . Doha really needed a competitor for Karwa .

And the main factor is a wife 's Job designation . ''	Good	PotentiallyUseful	U77	qatarisun	2012-01-08 16:10:56

It can be difficult finding things to occupy your time here ; especially when you 're new . I 'm not sure where you 're going to be living ? I live in an apartment block with my husband and it has no communal areas so have found it hard to meet and get to know my neighbours . I think compound life is a bit more sociable ? Anyway - a couple of ideas ... The Intercontinental Hotel ( the one near Katara ; not Intercont . the City ) has a special offer on Tuesdays and Wednesdays - ladies pay only 50 QR to access their pool / pool area . I take yoga classes with Yama Yoga http : //yamayogastudios.com - they are lovely and might be another way to meet people ? Also ; not sure what nationality / language your wife speaks but there are a number of associations for different nationalities here . Buy a copy of Marhaba magazine when you arrive - they have an up to date list of them with contact details - so she could socialise with people who speak her language .

Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you 'll get to know if its ready or not . For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test ( e.i . creatinine test ) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations . In your case ; you are only required to undergo blood test ( HIV ) & Chest X-ray ( PTB ) ; so i think it wont take long that much .

If your really lucky turtles . Anywhere north of Ras Laffan should be good . I was at Umm Tais Natural Reserves ( mentioned in post above - turn right at Al-Shammal and head east ; first island is Ras Rakkan and is harder to get to ; go past until a hamlet and past this you can access Umm Tais ) a few weeks ago ; interesting place but Fuwarait is easier to get to etc . `` `` Sandy '' '' beach we used to go to ; Al-Dhakriah mangroves . There is generally less to see on west coast than the east coast unless you go to places near construction which for the east coast is now a lot ! ! Hence i recommend French beach / fuwarait . There are also a few nice locations you can snorkell in the inland sea ; although currents at certain times are very very strong . GO past coastguard station at mouth and head along towards Saudi until you see obvious shallows . ''	Good	Good	U1074	Cnidaria	2008-05-28 10:00:32

This instance ; that happened with your wife ; almost happens almost everywhere in other countries . If I am taking a cab in Cairo ; where I live ; I will get tons of offers to hop into someone’s car . Not necessarily because I am pretty ; but because girls are hit on generally speaking . I’ve been here in Doha for a couple of years ; with family or without ; faced the usual hassles . Downsides : Persistent car followers . At malls guys throw their cell phone numbers at girls . In bars some guys impose themselves ; but usually there are guards . On the beach guys stare and offer company with no pressure . On the Cornich ( for long walks ; jogging and workouts ) guys may try to talk to her . But if the girl is serious enough ; no one can catch up with here speed to begin with ; unless he is a highly athletic trainer or something… ) Generally men stare ; specifically from certain down trodden ex-pats from some least deve ... ..

Even going to the Fruit and Vegetable Market ; where in any case ; it is much better if you have company with you ; not because people stare ; but they are used to dealing with men as mostly on Friday the men do the shopping . Wherever you go ; if they recognise you are foreigner ; ( because you are different ) they will look at you and the inflation will rise 200 % in every shop ( at least they will try ) . Qatar is no different than any other country but a lot more safe if you behave naturally you will not be molested . One thing more - on the streets it is very much a mans ' world and your will see relatively few women going alone shopping ; so for many people this is really strange .

Although the best way to enjoy your weekend in Doha is by get together with friends in one of our house ; have dinner ( bbq ) and drinks ( alcohol ) you can buy alcohol if you have the license ; play some games ( e.g . Risk and Card ) watch the latest dvd ; you can put music on and DANCE ( Becareful your neighbor ! ! ! ! ) and if you too drunk to go home ; your friend can get you a lift ; or there always a taxi . So you not worry to get cought on drunk and driving .	Bad	Good	U14	dragonfly212	2006-12-06 12:47:18

From what I can tell they are full of Philipino women and old western men with a few other undesirables in . Doha amongst many other cities in the world have a lot to learn about night clubs ; what makes them good and what makes them bad . Predominantly what makes them bad are the clients that frequent them ; in the case of Doha they will always be bad .

Many clubs are just institutions to carry on drinking after normal club closing time and to pick up members of the opposite sex . Real clubbing ... .IS ... . music ; dancing not what has been described on here . This is not just my opinion ; there are many clubbing web pages ; and you will find it hard pressed to find a description of what is described on this forum .

At the Diplomatic Club they get djs from all over the world . It is usually house music . They also have hip hop nights . Shit I think the Qube for males is about 80QRs ; of course free for woman .

This has the advantage of opening some doors to you ; if you are willing to go through any . like 25 points is the minimum you need I happened to learn to be a member of the book club . otherwise I have not read ( could have missed though ) anything about getting a prize with your points .

My son when he was preschool age attended Mulberry Bush and then Doha English Speaking Kindergarten . A good friend of mine owned and ran these places but I do n't think she still has Mulberry Bush . DESK was good though ; my son enjoyed getting out of the house and making his own friends there . It 's been a few years so I do n't know about any of the teachers ; etc that might still be there ; or if my friend Louise Al Jaidah still owns the place ; but you can call and find out . Good luck !

( maybe a dozen buildings ) I think they all have onsite management that can show you what is available . Personally ; I think the Pearl and Falcon Towers adjacent to the 4 Seasons Hotel are the best units and best located especially if you are able to join the Four Seasons Spa / Health Club . Al Farden Tower ( where the BMW dealer is located ) is very nice ; but no balconies if that is important to you . 44 Westbay Tower also has very nice units and great views from the upper floors .

Personally while all this building is going on and while there is a buzz about the place then I think prices for property will keep rising . I was reading a Dubai site the otherday saying prices are beginning to drop due to over supply . I think that problem is a long way off here . Plus I brought because my company will give me a housing allowance so they will be paying for my investment and when you look at it like that its a no brainer . Icidently I did look at the Pearl it is going to be very nice but just not soon enough and I think they are a bit over priced .	Bad	Good	U2	anonymous	2007-04-17 16:12:36

I looked at a place on the Pearl in Sabban Towers ; which will be the first completed tower on the pearl . I ; unfortunately could n't get the finance fast enough so i lost the apartment ; the tower is now sold-out . Property prices are rising roughly 10 % per month at the moment and trust me that is not going to slow down in a hurry . They just will never beable to build fast enough to catch up with the demand as has happened in Dubai . I definitely think it is a good invetsment ; even if the appreciation on the property slows down to 10 % per annum that is still a good investment when you condsider the fact that you are currently just pouring your rent money into someone else 's pocket or mortgage and you could be putting that into your on property which you can redeem when you sell the place .

As noted above ; you insure the car ; not the driver ; which is one of the reasons kids here can afford to drive massive landcruisers ; despite the slaughter of pedestrians . ( Blood money for non-Moslems is pretty minimal ; anyway . ) For cars over a certain age ; ( 2 years ? Dunno ) 3rd party is the only option . however ; and again as noted above ; cover for passengers is not automatic so check these things carefully with your Insurance Broker . Even the possibility of having residual alocohol in your bloodstream when some idiot slams into you some morning has to be specifically covered ; so it 's not a bad idea to go to a reputable international Insurance company if you think you might occasionally have non-family passengers or drink beer of an evening .

When our shipment arrived we simply had to find the moving company here and give them a map on where to deliver the goods . There may have been other steps handled by my wife or her company ; but it seemed fairly straightforward . Your employer and/or moving company should give adequate instructions . Be aware that they may quarantine and return later anything that they think needs to be reviewed for content ; like DVD 's ; VHS tapes ; books ; CDs etc . It seems our labeling of boxes helped them in this effort and so some of our DVDs that were in the labeled boxes arrived after quarantine while others that were just haphazardly packed were delivered on the first shipment . http : //www.xanga.com/BBetz	Bad	PotentiallyUseful	U836	BBetzinQatar	2006-05-14 17:02:23

The delay in the process is only at the level of the directore I 'm told . Apparently once the goods arrive in Doha ; the local agent contacts customs and sets a date with them to inspect the goods . This takes up to a week . after customs goes through ALL items ; they give their estimate and clearance . There is a tax of 5 % on the goods being brought in levied . However household goods are exempted from the tax and the agent applied to the directorate for exeption . This is where takes time and I 'm told can take upto 20 / 25 days to gte the clearance . Thus the option seems to be to either pay 5 % of the valuation they have done or wait .	Bad	Good	U2057	Banker	2006-05-17 22:11:43

Other than that ; hotels will let you use function rooms to have parties ; some will also source mini discos etc . Try also Dana Club ; Diplomatic Club etc . Depending on how large your party is ; other ideas include ; picnics ; trips to the zoo ; ice skating ( older kids ) Although you are providing the supervision and entertainment . Hope this helps .

My advice to you is just stay indoors you 'll be safe from rogue teenagers who 'll beat you and from stupid drivers who drives like they have a date with Death . Zoo ? you have that in your country . Beach ? I bet your own country have better beach resorts . Water theme park ? I do n't think sharing a pool with someone who only takes a bath once in a blue moon is a bad idea . Museum ? You 'll learn more by surfing the net .	Bad	Bad	U1877	zirkwander	2011-12-14 01:41:45

Processing a Business Visa application in Qatar can take 1 day to 2 weeks ; or more ... Once a Business Visa is approved ; the individual has 3 months to arrive to Qatar before the validity expires . If they do not arrive within 3 months ; the entire process must be restarted . Once the individual arrived in Qatar ; they can stay for an initial 30 days ; extendable twice ; for a total of 90 days before they will be required to exit Qatar . Hope this helps !

Since this is a Muslim country ; Christmas is celebrated mostly in private . It is not a public holiday . If you are a Catholic ; there is a midnight mass here . Just check the schedule . Private dinner party/gathering is how most Christians do it here . There are also some hotel/restaurants that schedule events during the day or the eve . The same goes for New Year . Most locals and other muslims are very tolerant about Christians celebrating Christmas ; some even join the New year celebrations . Just be well aware of the limits and keep your respect of the local culture .	Bad	Good	U2	anonymous	2008-10-23 08:43:37

Then we have dinner in the evening . We get up before dawn for a small breakfast . We try to be better Muslims in this month ... in the hope we can carry this on throughout the year .

Usually the night before ( or earlier if you 're really organised ) we gather the kids around and make some biscuits and traditional sweets . These are then ready to distribute during the Eid prayer and also to the neighbours . They are also really handy when people come to visit you during Eid . What I 've noticed here in Qatar is that friends and neighbours seem to visit each other a lot more on Eid than back home . I guess it 's because we do n't have family here ; so our friends tend to become our new support structure . On the 2 Eids that I 've so far spent in Qatar our 'new ' tradition seems to be going to City Centre and getting some good sale items ! LOL I guess that 's our variation on spending the day at the park ( too hot ) or visiting the grandparents ( too far ) or staying at home ( too boring ) .

Thanks : )	PerfectMatch	U4692	shabina921	50	2007-09-23 21:57:15	Q296_R50_C10	look ... these poor workers are enjoy more at their work rather then getting holiodays and moving around 2-3 days are far enough for their enjoying coz they prefer to do work and earn more and more overtime and salary .

When our shipment arrived we simply had to find the moving company here and give them a map on where to deliver the goods . There may have been other steps handled by my wife or her company ; but it seemed fairly straightforward . Your employer and/or moving company should give adequate instructions . Be aware that they may quarantine and return later anything that they think needs to be reviewed for content ; like DVD 's ; VHS tapes ; books ; CDs etc . It seems our labeling of boxes helped them in this effort and so some of our DVDs that were in the labeled boxes arrived after quarantine while others that were just haphazardly packed were delivered on the first shipment . http : //www.xanga.com/BBetz	Bad	PotentiallyUseful	U836	BBetzinQatar	2006-05-14 17:02:23

The delay in the process is only at the level of the directore I 'm told . Apparently once the goods arrive in Doha ; the local agent contacts customs and sets a date with them to inspect the goods . This takes up to a week . after customs goes through ALL items ; they give their estimate and clearance . There is a tax of 5 % on the goods being brought in levied . However household goods are exempted from the tax and the agent applied to the directorate for exeption . This is where takes time and I 'm told can take upto 20 / 25 days to gte the clearance . Thus the option seems to be to either pay 5 % of the valuation they have done or wait .	Bad	Good	U2057	Banker	2006-05-17 22:11:43

I’ve been here in Doha for a couple of years ; with family or without ; faced the usual hassles . Downsides : Persistent car followers . At malls guys throw their cell phone numbers at girls . In bars some guys impose themselves ; but usually there are guards . On the beach guys stare and offer company with no pressure . On the Cornich ( for long walks ; jogging and workouts ) guys may try to talk to her .

If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates . For them everything is double . - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle . For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser ; beautician ; etc . usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene . If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get .	Bad	PotentiallyUseful	U3873	Doha Sun	2008-07-23 15:43:56

The matter of homosexuality is by far a much disputed affair among people of various religions ; creeds and races ; that to simply state it 's right and all those who condemn it for any reason is wrong ; will not be as simple . That said if they wish to protect those who are gay and transgenders from oppression and mistreatment then I suppose they have all the liberty to do so ; however yes they should also then open their eyes to all the oppression committed around the world at large ; and work towards stamping them out ; and not just pick and choose to their convenience which has clearly been the case with UN in the recent times ; which has caused people around the globe to hold them in contempt for ; and not take them seriously .

However ; the fact remains that prostitution is wide spread in certain places in Qatar and thrives ; until something is said by somebody ; and then the routine mass deportations take place . It goes quiet for a while ; and then the 'night girls ' start building up in numbers again to the level they are now . My last sentence ; before the previous thread was deleted was something like this ; 'mark my words ; the ladies will vanish any day now . Over the few weeks after that ; their numbers will slowly increase again ; and the cycle repeats it 's self ' . Obviously somebody is behind this ( a pimp ) ; as a sponsor for these girls .

Of these your best bet for Fri and Sat night ( my OPINION ; so no flames from anyone ) is going to be Rydges .

Risk and Card ) watch the latest dvd ; you can put music on and DANCE ( Becareful your neighbor ! ! ! ! ) and if you too drunk to go home ; your friend can get you a lift ; or there always a taxi .

Do you go around with ; showing everyone your LABOR CONTRACT where it states that you are MANAGER ? Does anybody around you care whether you are Manager or not on your VISA ? I ca n't even seem to find the benefit of changing the title ; not unless you want to brag around everyone saying 'I 've got a Manager 's title on my VISA ' . I am an ENGINEER without a MASTERS degree ; but my title is ELECTRICIAN . What 's the BIG DEAL ?

I am keen to do cosmetic work on the cruiser . Complete body re-paint and polish ... but i am looking for someone who does a really really neat job . Most of the paint shops out there just want to get the job done and are not overly concerned about the quality . As a customer ; my top concern is the quality and finishing . Any suggestions guys ? Any phone numbers would be appreciated . cheers	Bad	Bad	U2	anonymous	2012-09-16 11:59:01

Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you 'll get to know if its ready or not . For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test ( e.i . creatinine test ) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations . In your case ; you are only required to undergo blood test ( HIV ) & Chest X-ray ( PTB ) ; so i think it wont take long that much . Dont you have mandoop/representative for your company ? he is supposed to follow up all these things and you can always check w/ him . Good Luck !	Bad	Good	U1137	Apple	2007-04-19 17:39:24

However ; if you have an INTERNATIONAL DRIVING LICENSE ; THERE IS NO TIME LIMIT . Before the seven-day period is up ; you will need to get a temporary driving license that is valid for the period of your visa . All nationalities may exchange their country of origin 's license for a temporary Qatar license ; however you may not do so if you have already started the residence visa process . If this has been started ; you will have to wait for the visa before applying for a permanent license . To obtain the temporary license ; you will need to apply in person at the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department ; where you will be required to complete an application form .

I went to Traffic department and asked . # 1 - Not all international licenses are valid . Only ones from certain countries and they have to come with a booklet that contains a card . # 2 - No matter what your status is ; It is allowed to drive on it for 2 weeks from the time you enter the city . After 2 weeks if you get into an accident ; it is your fault no matter what . Car rentals do n't tell you these things because you are buying their insurance anyways ! # 3 - International License means nothing without your original license from back home . When you want to make the Qatar License ; you NEED your original license from back home and it has to be recognized so that you do n't go through the driving tests in here .

After i got Qatar RP ; I applied for a Qatar DL at the Traffic Department . I submitted my original UAE DL for inspection and then they required me to have an eye test only . After passing the eye test ; i was issued a Qatar DL In some GCC states ; I hear this is not the case ; for example ; here in Qatar I hear that they do not recognize Saudi DL ?

Yes Doha is a tough city to live in and the cost of living will cause you to save little to nothing each month . Plus they are n't going to pay you what you 're worth because you are Chinese . Chinese are put into the lower-income bracket in Qatar - that is just the way it is over here . Not fair ; I know . If you do go ... do n't let them take your passport from you because then you may find yourself working at the Oasis just so you can buy back your freedom . I hope this helps .

Qatar taxes income by housing rent ( 50 % mininum ) so if you manage to get a job make sure the company houses you or at least pays you the amount of your rent ( even if it increases ) . You will need QR 1000 for food & other expenses if single . Anything above that you can save ; depending on how much you want to save . I would say the minimum one should ask for should be QR 2000 above the Rent ; else you would be really wasting your time and youth . Although there are Construction workers who work for QR700 which would be roughly what they earn in their own countries . ( SriLankans & Nepalis mostly come here to get away from the civil war in their countries so they are willing to work for so low . ) Qatar is booming in 2 sectors Oil/Gas and Construction . 1st is Nationalised so you may find it difficult to get into . The second is not a boom its a BLAST . Theres always jobs in Construction Companies . All other services are growing ... ..	Good	Good	U2	anonymous	2007-02-26 09:21:41

I started reading at 11am and did not stop until 11pm . I immediately knew that this was the religion for me ; eventhough I was highly sceptical when I started reading ... . I have read so much since ; learned by talking to other Moslims ; taken some courses ; but my thing is reading so I did that the most . I suggest you talk to some other new moslims . It will be easier as the questions you have are the same questions they had . When I started there were not many people I could approach ; nor where there any centres as such and I talked with moslims by birth and they had a hard time understanding my questions . Ofcourse if I can help ; let me know ! Aisha-Taweela	Bad	Good	U427	Aisha-Taweela	2008-04-09 15:18:57

Irrelevant	U2	anonymous	11	2008-04-09 15:08:56	Q305_R11_C4	It is not a question of easy or not . Converting to Islam is not just saying ; Hey world I think I will become a moslim . No it is much much deeper . It is a question of a total change in lifestyle ( in my case at least ) It has more to do with your innerself . How you look ; approach and accept what is in your life . I can tell you it did better than going to a phychoanalist . You learn so much about your self ; about the purpose of you being there ; about the purpose of living ; about the purpose of hardship . Islam should not be hard on you . But it is how hard you make it on yourself . Aisha-Taweela	Bad	Good	U427	Aisha-Taweela	2008-04-09 15:29:19

Then logically ; the universe is supposed to come back to its original state at some point of time..who knows . I have tried but could never understand 'quantum Fluctuations ' which is said to be the reason for the big bang out of a singularity . Further ; the 'anti-matter ' and 'negetive energies ' are still theoretical concepts . If the same are proven someday ; it would further help us to understand if the universe will die at all . But ; at present ; it is a general opinion that universe will keep on expanding and may freeze out when all stars would become either black holes ; neutron stars or white dwarfs .

Unfortunately the popularity of 'couples ' clubs ; where couples seek another couple for sexual purposes is becoming more and more popular . Prostitution in some countries is legal ; some not .

Thanks	Irrelevant	U1493	GRP	54	2007-04-15 17:42:51	Q306_R54_C5	Once you are done w/ ur medical exam you can check w/ the medical commission at least after 3 working days . Just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you 'll get to know if its ready or not . For a medical employees it usually takes about 2 wks to have the results done due to other test ( e.i . creatinine test ) that has to be sent to HMC for investigations . In your case ; you are only required to undergo blood test ( HIV ) & Chest X-ray ( PTB ) ; so i think it wont take long that much . Dont you have mandoop/representative for your company ? he is supposed to follow up all these things and you can always check w/ him . Good Luck !	Bad	Good	U1137	Apple	2007-04-19 17:39:24

The basic is equivalent to RM10 ; 000 . Many nurses from Hospital Johor Bahru working there since the first group explore the opportunities . I am also from health background but bye.. bye.. MOH . In term of RM i got 20X better than what they can offer me . If me ; with the offer that Qatar can give us ; better to stay malaysia ; get a degree ; and apply for Nurse Manager in malaysia @ overseas . It is not easy to live here ( Qatar ) without David & Kids and not worth to leave them behind with the such offer . Normally Malaysian put RM15 ; 000 for oil & gas practisioner as a minimum salary per month . & others sector is RM 10 ; 000.00 . OTHERWISE ; better to stay home ! !

Due to the conservative background of the boys they will always return to their families and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the families would not be happy about it . I think it is much better to be very cautious out here although there are a great many handsome men and they can be very charming going through the Arab and Asian world of men they are all interested in SEX . One of the things is that being found to be together whoc ae not married can get into very deep trouble here - just a little food for thought .	Bad	Good	U2	anonymous	2006-06-03 16:27:48

Maybe it originally stems from the days when arabs had loads of money ; visited capital cities ( mainly in the West ) and were naturally surrounded ( as they were rich ) by hookers . Word spread when they returned that they had been with western women . The assumption would then be made that all Western women were loose . That is the assumption that we came to many years ago .

It is a very rare man in the West that wants anything more to do with a Asian girl than you just described . Its impossible to believe that the thousands of crippled shaking 70 year old Western men moving with 21 year old Asian beauties do so ... because the guy was so romantic ; loving and responsible that the girl fell head over heals in love with him.. I have seen Western men in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years . Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date .

If he gets a new job ; he can transfer from my sponsorship to his new comp . I know people who came on wife 's sponsorship and looked for a job and transferred thier sponsorship to thier new employers once they got a job . But that person did not have a job or previous sponsorship . Our case is different ; cause he has a current sponsorship .

You can take it for an evaluation to the Bosch Service Center where for 500 Qr . they will give you a bumper to bumper report on the condition of the car..you 'll need to leave it with them for half a day though..I suggest its money and time well spent to ensure you get a good reliable car..

I studied in Pakshama from 80 to 88 but it was n't so bad that time . We had mostly Indian teachers so the standard of English was pretty good . But then somewhere end of the 80 's or beginning of 90 's they removed all Indian teachers and hired Pakistani teachers so their standard detoriated in a few months . I shifted to PEC in 88 or 89 and I was shocked to see Pathan teachers who could not speak or write English properly . They were pathetic in grammar and pronunciation . In 1996 I got a job at Bright Future when they had just opened . I have seen their method and standard of teaching very closely.. They are just as bad as the other two . I would advise you to send your children to some international school if you can afford or else to one of the Indian schools.. There are five of them here and all are equally good..

My son is having problem with his study there . Lack of attention from the teacher and lack of skill of teaching also . They dont have activities to boost the interest of learning for the kids . lack of creativity . Too much URDU Lesson ( which I dont understand how to help him with his Urdu homework ) . If you lucky ; your child will be teached by skilled teacher ( my son had a very nice and good teacher when he was at KG2 at the same school ) . Unfortunately this year for grade 1 ; he 's stuck with unskilled teacher : ( Indian school ? yes they are good ; but very difficult to get space . We 've been trying for a year now . NO LUCK ! !

I tried several times but they refused and saoid come back when three months complete . However you can stay here more than 6 months ; your husband can go to immigration and talk with captain he will extend one month more ; some time more than one month.Good Luck	PotentiallyUseful	Good	U80	Medii123	2015-01-05 15:41:30

Tourist visit visa is is valid for 30 days and can be extended for another 30 days ; 60 days stay in total .	PotentiallyUseful	PotentiallyUseful	U77	qatarisun	2010-05-27 13:49:07

However note that some new houses have high rents ( 'cause they 're new and big ) but are located in crap areas ! For a good place in a compound or high building you need at least 15'000 QR ; and many of those places already have waiting lists . Prices however are not comparable to rentals in other countries . There 's shortage of good accommodations which increases the rates ; it 's not that housing is better in Doha then elsewhere .

It is not necessary that the facilities will be very good if you are paying a bigger rent . I think now a days the rents are depending on the locations and not on the facilities . There are some areas in Qatar where you have to pay 7-8k per month for a two bedroom accommodation and there are some areas where you will be asked for 10-12k for two bedroom accommodation with the same facilities .

I was also a nurse back home so I have formed my opinions of the health service here based on this . Qatar has a NHS that is available to all residents once you have paid 100QR for a health card that gives you a patient number . This entitles you to emergency treatment ; routine referrals ; surgery etc . It is not free at the point of delivery but an outpatient appointment is 50QR for the first appointment then 30QR each visit . Overnight stays depend on the type of ward you choose ; single room ; semi private ( 2 beds ) or ward ( 4 beds ) . I had an op here and was in a 4 bed ward and it was fine ; cost 100QR for 2 nights .

Marrying you out of the country can cause major problems for your fiance ; so I would suggest you wait until your marriage is approved . The only other option is that you relocate somewhere else ; marry there ; but your marriage will not be valid in Qatar ; and you will have no claim to any inheritences if god forbid ; something should happen to him . Does your fiance not have some Wasta ; that can obtain your release from your company ? I am not saying that will make things any easier ; since you still need to have the govt approval for marriage ; but at least you can be in Qatar ; near him .	Good	Good	U245	Xena	2011-04-27 12:21:22

You should negotiate on the part where the company provide insurance for the entire family . No logic in them providing insurance just for you . Second ; do negotiate the car allowance coz if you plan to rent a car ; a good vehicle ; say a honda civic would cost you qrs . 2500. a 4WD would cost you much more . Third ; do check where your working base is going to be . Is it in Al Khor ? If yes ; it is a nice location along with a community where your family will feel at home . I stated Al Khor coz most of the leading big petroleum companies are in the Al Khor side . All the best . Cheerios	Bad	Good	U5512	avarakadavaraa	2011-07-29 21:57:01

I moved in August as well . but atleast you can comfort yourself in knowing you 're hitting the worst weather by that time and its only positive from then on . Quick addition : I do suggest you actually move with stuff ... especially if you and your partner are doing this together . clothing is expensive here and if it 's just 'your own stuff ' that you want around the house ; pack a few boxes of clothes you want ; pics ; music or books or whatever . everything retail and consumable is expensive . As for a moving company ... . I 've used Crown Relocations on all of my last 3 moves between countries and they are top notch in every place . Visa stuff ... let the employer take are of that . I can recommend that you have at minimum 2 certified and originals of all legal documents ( birth certs ; marriage certs ; etc. ) ... it is easier if you need them later on than having to wait to obtain them .

I already visited the company and I was thrilled with the place and the employees ; they are extremely nice and helpful which you do n't really find in much TV stations so it is a blessing . As per your concern about accomodation ; from what I heard is that all employees who are married and have children are provided with a very decent villa in a compound and single employees are provided with a 3 bdrm furnished apartment in a nice place as well . After all aljazeera has a big name and I dont think they will throw their employees ( their best resources ) in a place that is unfit or unsafe . Good luck and I hope to see you there .

Any feedback would be welcome thanks !

They both serve alcohol ; have music ( live/djs ) but that 's where the comparison ends . `` `` Where would you go for RnB and hiphop ? '' '' Take a plane and go somewhere else . : - ) I 'd suggest Heat or Mercury Lounge in Melbourne for RnB/Hip Hop . ; - ) ( Bit of promotion from an ex-employee ) If you still wan na come to the Middle East for clubbing ; go to Beirut or Istanbul . Maybe even Cairo for that matter . Or go to Goa ; India if you wan na spend Xmas at trance parties on the beaches .
