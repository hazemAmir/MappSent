Q351_R20	moving to qatar	cash or cards ? ? ?	yipeeeee ; i finally get my visa to come to doha ! ! should i bring some cash with me for when i first arrive in doha or will it be easy enough to use my cash card ? are there cash matchines at the airport and in the hotel ? thanks for any advice .	U5823	Son70	2007-09-25 13:55:45	Q351_R20_C6	mmm ... well ; i can see your point there . however ; a you 're just arrive in the country ; no one be expect you to have riyal ready to distribute . or i 'd hope not . besides ; the atm spit out big bill than you 'd tip to a driver ( a in every country ; uk include ) . so then you 'd have the trouble of have to get one break down . if you 're go to the hotel ; and you really want to tip the driver ; just ask him to wait for a second . run in ; tell them what you want to do ; and change a bill . or borrow 10 riyal from the bellhop ; tell them you 're change money in just a second ; and then give it back after you 've change money . truthfully ; though ; i would n't sweat it too much . you 'll have other thing to occupy yourself with . which hotel ? the intercon be quite nice . the breakfast buffet be gigantic . literally 15 kind of bread ( at least ) . fresh fruit juice . a whole long table fill with fruit and cheese .
