 dear ; all ! please read question before you be write answer ! i wasn`t ask where i can do massage ! ! ! i ask about oil ! as for second answer - i`m search oil for body massage . bought one in canterpoint ; there be a small shop near sport shop ; and that oil have nice smell ; but ! it`s not for make massage to anyone !
 again ... i`m happy for you that you have oil ? ! did you read my question ? ! i have a lot of thing ; but i`m not write here about it ! ! ! don`t be stupid ; people ; read before you write something ! ! ! i have question ; need answer directly to this question ; not your empty answer about nothing !
 you might be able to find body massage oil in body shop at landmark or city centre ; and if they do have it there ; it guaranteed to be good for massage ; a some place sell duplicate ; so watch out a this could cause allergy to the skin . good luck !

 iphone 4
 chief tailor i think he already get yuor message ... . once be enough .
 boyfriend cant . but a a husband he can apply for visit visa for both of you .
 how can my boyfriend get me and our baby son a visit visa there ? how can my boyfriend who currently work for a government office there get me and our baby a visit visa ? how long can we stay there in doha and can we also get marry there as well ? can we stay together in his house there ? can you give u advice and the step to take for get visa and requirement for marriage there in qatar ? it will be greatly appreciated.thanks in advance
 yep boyfriend can not sponsor you but if he become your husband then he can..
 as far a i know you need to show a proof a a marriage certificate when apply a you have to show your proof of relationship .
 your nationality play a major role here . coz there r certain citizenship who can get on arrival visa just from the airport on arrival . if u r from one of those country ; u do n't have any problem . just buy the ticket ; come down here ; get the visa from the airport on arrival but your citizenship ... ... ! ! ! ! !
 we want to get marry there in qatar once we arrive there..its this possible ? i be tell that he can apply for visit visa for me and our son.. he want u to get marry in qatar
 dear ; why dont you let your boy friend arrange the thing for you if he really want to marry you here . the process would be long and lot of documentation need . i have a friend who get marry here ( no child ) lot of documentation need and take long time to get their marriage certificate issue and therefore she have to fly back to her home country wait for the attestation of the marriage certificate . once it be do ; then wait for family visa to be process . so get yourself ready for all the process . good luck for your wedding .
 thanks for your answer but i really would like some help on this . we want to get marry in qatar . the fact that we be get marry there be it not proof enough for qatari official to know that we will be legal and enough requirement for u to stay with my fiance in his house ? we be suppose to get marry here in the philippines but he do n't have time for u to set the wedding here..thanks again !
 much easy to get a civil marry first then apply for the visa ; this way you can stay with him legally with no worry at all
 since u specifically about next then the price r the same ... except that here u dont get everything u find over in the uk but we do have most of the british stores.we have debanhams ; m & s ; bhs and next.but over all 1000 be way to much to pay ... .depending on how much clothes you have ... ..or need ... i would humbly suggest that u evaluate yr clothes because u know the price ; u alone will be able to judge if the money will buy u what u decide to leave behind ... good luck
 i 'm kinda particular about and partial to my clothing so i bring mine . the choice here be not infinite and there be n't the catelog shopping available either .
 if you already have clothes then it 's infinitely cheap to bring them than to buy more !
 is it cheap to buy new clothes in qatar than pay to transport them over from the uk ? i begin employment in qatar aug 09 and have just be quote 1000 to have them fly over . is it worth the hassle of custom or should i buy new ? how do price compare uk next with qatar next ?
 i would just want to reiterate that price be much high here . for example yesterday in m & s look at a pair of trouser ; uk price 29.50 ; qatar price 200qr ; which mean about 38 sterling at the current rate . next i have find to be even bad than this . at another shop buy my son some clarks sandles cost 245qr which would have be 30 in the uk . talk about mark up ! i would also say that the range of clothing to the average uk taste be quite limited . as soon a you go outside of the uk shop you can run into some rather ornate clothing . the quality can be questionable aswell . not sure how the high end international shop compare . i be currently count down the day til i go back to the uk in the summer and hit the summer sale ! planning on go with empty case and come back with rather full one lol .
 you can resign and go back
 have u sign any contract ? if u have ; check what be stipulate there.. sometimes ; employer require the employee to pay a certain amount of fee if he/she resigns before the probationary period ; but you do n't mention how long you 've be work with the company..
 the problem be ... expense
 like get ban for 2 year > is that right ?

 it might take awhile to sell a dodge car nowadays and if you be look for a best sell place i do n't suggest you to park your car in one of those car shop at salwa road ; it take awhile to be notice ; so your best bet to find car showroom inside doha or add your car at http : //qatarsale.com by contact them and they will do the rest

 http : //www.qatarliving.com/answers/living-in-qatar/any-hindu-temple write temple on the search at the right hand side u will find many thread on this topic ... ... ... ... ..
 qatar be basically an islamic country and they see asian expat a slave and nothi8ng more . so u may see church here but you wont find temple . and idol worship be not allow in islam . hence you wont find temple here . i hope one day qatar change the attitude of see asian a slave .
 shayampsundar ... ... . you be prejudice against qatar ... ... ... ... why not you leave this country if your religious sentiment be be bash ... .. a you claim ! ! asians be slave ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? are you treat yourself a a leader of again community here . beware such statement can lead to your deportation also ... ... . i know you be still a kid ( base on your profile ) ... ... but refrain from unworthy comment ... ... otherwise this would lead to problem for your parent who be earn their livelihood here and feed you ! ! !
 shyam sunder ... . be they treat u a a slave or do u consider yourself to be a rotten slave ... .coz i do not think that any one here have bother to chain ur leg to some shackle here and keep u bond ... u be here just for your some meaningful gain and u be make yourself a slave to the country..like any respect a human be deserves everyone have the freedom to choose to stay or go away from a place he like or dislike ... so if u do not like the system here y the hell be u make urself a slave or a dog over here ... get lose man to ur own country and iam sure wherever u go u will definitely treat others a slaves..so cheer
 be there any temple in qatar ... ... hi ; a most indian live in qatar ... . be there any temple in qatar ... ..
 shayampsundar ; u have the right to speak out and give ur comment or suggestion but u should respect qatar or the relegion islam ! by give comment to ur brother ... .. if somebody treat u a slave do n't generalize all the local or qatari/we all know most indian be lazy and try hard/they think that they know everything but we know that their really something/talkative and staburn ...

 i didnt see any globe sim in filipino souq ... there be lot of smart sim available in souq..
 simangot ; i suggest your gf switch to smart sim in pinas . i will tell you some encouragement and idea . and advantage and disadvantage of both globe and smart . here it go : with smart ; you dont have to load everyday or every week just to maintain your sim or be activate . you can do smartload or over the air reload once in 3 months . the sim will be deactivate within 120 day of no load . 1 peso text from pinas to internatioal roaming sim . smart signal be also good in doha . in industrial area be good ; why not in the city . : ) with globe ; you have to maintain a load everytime for the rest of your life in abroad . much expensive . with smart ; when activate a roaming sim ; pure text only . while globe ; you can receive/make call but it 's expensive . international rate charges apply . if you happen to buy that globe ofw sim ; it 's a bull ! they say on the tv commercials that no maintain balance for 1 year or forever ; i dont remember anymore . it 's not true ! you still have to reload within 1 month of use . i guess you be work here in doha ; right ? i bet you talk to your gf at night or after work or in the morning . why do n't you buy qtel sim from qtel offices . it 's only 50qr now ; i think they still have this promo go on . or good yet ; there be this internet call locate in doha . maybe it in souq or industrial area . 1 minute be to 1qr . cheaper than use your qtel sim to call pinas for 1.85qr per minute .

 how be gulf driving school ? i want to take a driving classes from gulf driving school a it be near to my flat . can anyone suggest me the popularity of this school ?
 it 's popular with guy live near your flat .
 most of people prefer karwa drive school . as registration process be swift . i hear from my fella there be some offerfor full course ; but your enrollment will come after 1 month .
 gulf drive school offer the best chance of you get your licence among all the driving school . it be popular because of the high success rate . the teaching however be terrible . so if you really want to learn driving ; go to some other place . if you just want the licence ; you can try gulf drive school

 bosnian emabssy be on d ring road ; but go to 180 and get number ; call them and get location .
 walking in doha hi this might be a bit of an odd question but can you walk from the japanese embassy or the kempinski hotel to city centre shopping centre ? it look definitely walkable distance-wise but do the road preclude any chance of walk ?
 yes ; but only in the winter ! mandi
 u have dodge bullet bomb and air strike
 i see a lot of people be walk in city centre area in the evening and weekend . they park their car all around w ; kempinski ; and stuff ; and just walk.. it 's not really safe ; a there be no sidewalk in doha ; but a i say ; i see many people do it.. life be unsafe in general.. so..
 thanks very much . i once make the mistake before go out to dubai of assume i could easily walk across the sheikh zayed road ...
 i happen to know first hand..factors such a age ; education and earnings for the past 12 mths of the applicant will be allot 'points ' and if he/she meet the minimum point for this visa category then it not a problem at all . you will have to apply from outside the uk for this ; even if you be currently reside there under a different visa category . what do you want to know specifically ? ~live like there 's no tommorrow~
 thanks for your reply pin ; have u apply before for this type of visa ? i would like to know how easy i can be accept and how long it take to know if i will be grant this visa.. please advise
 yes ; i have be work and live in london for more than 1 year under a highly skilled migrant programme ( hsmp ) and i subsequently switch to tier 1 ( general ) . bear in mind - i get my visa way before the uk recession and job be easy to come by . now unemployment be a big issue here . you wo n't be able to renew the tier 1 visa without a skilled job . anyways ; it be unlawful to reject your application if you : - 1 ) have meet the minimum 75 point 2 ) can proof that you meet the required english standard 3 ) have minimum fund of gbp2800 . 4 ) obviously ; you must not have any prior criminal conviction or have previously abuse your immigration status ( i.e . overstay on a visa ; outstanding fine in uk ; etc ) do n't bother apply if you do n't meet the above . for me ; application to approval take 3 week ; apply from kl ; malaysia . for precise requirement and how point be calculate ; see http : //www.ukvisas.gov.uk/en/howtoapply/infs/inf21pbsgeneralmigrant # 6375036 good luck . ~live like there 's no tommorrow~
 i be so lucky to have your advice ; know that u go through the same procedure before . what do u mean `` you wo n't be able to renew the tier 1 visa without a skilled job '' . actually i be not renew ; and do they gauge their approval by the required profession on top of the one u mention . do u validate ur degree with naric ; any advice here ? must be the bank statement not old than 7 day or it be fine to be a bit old ? i have apply toefle for more than 5 year ago ; do they take this into consideration ? please advise ; thanks v much indeed
 the tier 1 general visa be for 24 month only . to extend your stay beyond 24 month you must renew it . you wo n't be able to do so without a job . as far a i know ; you must have at least a bachelor 's degree and that 's how they accept that you be 'highly skilled ' . they want original document ; no copy . do n't worry they will return these to you . bank statement - late 3 month show minimum of gbp2800 and must be original a well . toefl be accept ; mark must be 110-120 ( internet base test ) . you must also provide the original cert and test score . ~live like there 's no tommorrow~
 do u think that they accept notarized copy of my certificate and not original one ? be it possible to get ur email for future correspondence ? thanks so much ; you have be v helpful to me
 general tier 1 migrant visa to uk hi lady and gentleman ; i would like to know if any one have experience apply for uk visa general tier 1 that allow u to work in uk . please ur advise be v important .

 http : //www.childdevelopmentinfo.com/health do n't use medication without ask dr .
 dont let them sleep for a day in the morning.at night they will fall asleep.continue this for a week.they will get used.do n't ever change the sheddule time.put them on bed on time.let them be entertain during day time.and not allow at night . if they be toddler they usually dose'nt want to sleep.they try to experience the surroundings.make them to understand that night be to sleep or rest.do n't use light which be bright.try not to use or a very mild power.do n't encourage them at night to talk/play/have snacks..etc.so they 'll feel the night boaring and they automatically go to sleep . try some bedtime stories.give them a bed time and never ever change it.be stricked on the rule.i think it will work out surely .

 i be a bachelor so i guess ca n't be a member ; will contact you next year when i be married. `` when someone annoy you it take 42 muscle in your face to frown ; but ; it only take 4 muscle to extend your arm and slap that @ & % $ % ^ $ $ # & ! ! ! ! ''
 good one arrhsa..lol
 i be really look to find a solution for buy online localy in qatar or from internet such a amazoon.com . i hear that one banke issue such card @ 500 qr ; and they deduct 50 qr service and you can buy up to 450 qr . but i do n't try to find that bank
 qnb use to do it .. but now they make it for only cc holder u can check with the group or doha bank
 using atm card would be great ; but it be not safe . i addition to that who ask this quastion dont have an bank account .
 prepaid credit card for online purchasing ? is there any prepaid service ; which i can use for online shopping ? i dont know what it call ; prepay credit card or prepaid debit card or what ? anyway ; actually i dont want to open a bank account . im look something more easy and instant ; if i pay cash and they give me online credit for purchase ? i dont know be it possible or not and how it work . if anybody have some idea about it will be grateful for me .
 if any body can advice qnb and doha bank tel . no . to call them and aske to get good information and details
 go to jarir bookstore they sell those card call cashu . but they work on some internet site . go check it out . before buy go to cashu.com and check if the site you want buy from have it .

 the cost of buy 1000 qmiles directly from qatar airways be qr 120 . you should accept no less than qr 80 per 1000 . many people would want to spend money on transfer ; rather they want you to go with them to the qatar airways office to permit the use of the qmiles you agree on ; they will pay you the agreed amount ; and pay qatar airways the tax and other fee .
 `` many people would < b > not < /b > want to spend money on transfer ''
 hi ; are u still interested in sell qmiles ?

 are there any company in qatar that hire out baby furniture and car seats ? we be move to qatar but shipping of all our belonging wo n't arrive for nearly 5 week after we do . we ca n't decide if it 's best to pay excess bagage and bring item like child port-a-cot and car seat with u or put in shipping . is there a company in qatar that do short term hire out of item include cot ; car seat ; high chair etc ?
 hi airlines will not charge you extra for a car seat and travel cot . i have travel the uk ; south africa and switzerland and i have always be able to take my stroller ; car seat and travel cot with me at no extra charge . phone the airline and find out !
 definitely phone the airline . the baggage rule have change a lot and we nearly get stung for us $ 525 for three bag earlier this month . as recently a october 2008 you could fly from the u.s. to doha on qatar airways without the carseats count toward your baggage requirement at all . in other word ; you be allow two bag per passenger . . .so if there be two adult and two ( pay ) kid then you be allow eight bag plus the two car seat . but no longer . . .now you would be allow six bag plus two car seat . anything over that cost us $ 175 *per bag* . we learn this the hard way ; so it 's not an urban legend for u : (
 oh - and to answer your question ( sorry 'bout that ! ) i be not aware of any company that hire them out . car seat ; in particular ; be generally not use outside of the expatriate crowd . : ( you can find what you need at the city center babyshop store ; but depend on your luggage situation it might just make sense to bring it with you .
 imposible !

 if the wife be under the sponsorship of his husband he can freely tranfer to any company .
 can she work with gov under her husband sponsring a well ?
 good to follow the term in the labor law regard terminate a contract by either party .
 well ; it 's a bit more complex than that . if she get a job that allow her to stay under her husband 's sponsorship she can change without an noc . some job require you be under their sponsorship . mandi
 anyone ?
 it seem difficult 4rth time the transfer of sponsorship ; thrice be ordinary . but if u have some reliable source ( wasta ) in immigration ; would be ok then . even if current company let you free to work anywhere ; but immigration might be an obstacle .
 it 's fine dear ... . as long a you pay for it ; it 's ok ... .you can change sponsorship as mush a you want as long a you have noc . i myself change 5 time . so no worry ...
 transfer of sponsorship one of my colleague have already use his tranfer of sponsorship facility three time ; now due to recession and loss of work he want to use this facility for a fourth time . is it possible and permit for transfer of sponsorship to be do for a fourth time or be it only limit to three time ( maximum ) .
 thanks ... a lot .
 consular service for greek national cyprus embassy in doha be represent the consular interest and diplomatic protection of greek national who live and work in qatar since there be no greek embassy in the country . greek national can certify document ; signature and ask for a permanent resident certificate . the price for the certification be 5 ( around qr40 depend on exchange rate ) also cyprus embassy keep a mailing list where greeks and cypriots who live and work in qatar be encourage to register . the mailing list be update daily and every effort be make for the best accuracy . the embassy distribute security information when necessary and other important information to the registered national . the greek ambassador to qatar be the ambassador of greek embassy in kuwait . since cyprus have not start issue shengen visa yet ; visa application for greece be be process by the embassy of france . for more information please contact the consular section of the embassy . check this link ; http : //www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/embassies/embassy ? opendocument
 try this one : p.o box 15721 doha-qatar tel ( 00974 ) 4128150
 it be near inter continental hotel .
 it have recently open and the prime minister of the greece be here for the last 3 day ; it be near intercontinental hotel roundabout ; go to the left from the rb and then first right ; you will find a sign for greek embassy ; bahrain embassy and chouefat school ( sabis ) the information below about the cyprus embassy be old and obselete
 the first answer be outdated - it should be delete . there be a greek embassy in qatar and it hour be 10-12 daily except fridays . location opposite the doha exibition center . if you be drive from city center and make a u-turn at the doha exibition center round about . in about 400 meter make a right turn . once you make the right ; follow through - maybe the second right and another right till you see some van belong to a construction office . you will find the greek embassy close to them . 412 8150 greek embassy phone number
 from what i know ; you will be ban from qatar if your employment do not give a release and you will have to wait for at least two year to go back to qatar .
 if you get the no objection certificate from current sponsor u can enter in doha with valid visa
 your sponsor can ban you for lifetime ; 5 year and minimum 2 year .this 2 year ban be by govt.it be common for anybody who cancel rp and go out.more than 2 yrs ban your sponsor have to show solid reason to mini of interior and it be very hard for employer . now if you want to return before 2 year ; noc be requried from old sponsor.if you carry noc with you at time of dept ; it need to be endorse by immigration and this endorsement will expire automaticaly after 6 months.in that case your new employer have to get another one to get your new visa . but wait ; ; ; ; ; ; ; which visa be you ? some type of visa do not need 2 year bar .
 if u hv noc u can come ; make sure you get ur rp cancel by your current company before leave ; make sure you have not cross 3 month of expiry of rp . why do n't you get sponsorship change since u have release . good luck ! ! !
 employment band help ! ! who be impose a 2 yr band ? company or immigration ? like in my case i resign from work ; my visa be expire but the company give me a release ; if i will go back to my country will i have an employment band ? ? ? and need to wait for 2 yr to finish to enter doha again ?
 actually my paper be in the labor dept . we be apply for my change of sponsorship we be reject twice ; the reason be the immigration impose a new rule that company sponsorship transfer to husband sponsorship be not allow or vice versa..now my visa be expire and i need to go back home that 's why i be ask if i will go back home will i be able to come back here in qatar after my 2 month vacation ; by the way i have my noc w/ me and release paper from my previous company .
 i love it.. : ) )
 how can you `` claim `` one ?
 i be not sure if there be any penalty but they tell you if you dont collect within 30 days the number plate be scrap and you will have to pay for the plate again ; i think it 250 qar for two . but try to go back to the traffic department just incase your plate be still there you can say you go out on holiday or so .. just give it a shot ...
 there be no penalty but you have to apply again for a new plate .
 thanks for your comment . yes ; there be no penalty but we pay for the new plate .
 haha ... .guess ur in shit ... why do u do this ?
 dating be n't an issue ; it have a sexual relationship that be the issue . i think jail would come into it if one of the party be marry . still ; could be bad ; it stoning in some other country !
 well yes ; if they find you kiss or  in public or even in room ( if some one saw you and complain ) so well be careful . dating be not a issue ; do something nasty will bring trouble for you . so ms strawberry ; u can go for date ...

 thanks guy .
 many thanks for your valued support but a usual book be heavy around 8-9 kg total . if i use postal be sure i will end up pay a huge charge any other alternative..
 well ; then i guess you could check and see who be come to qatar from dubai ; and request them to get the book for you . but to be honest ; i do n't think anyone would be willing to fill in 8-9 kg of their own luggage space ; just to get book for someone else ! ; thinkin this way ; you might find the shipment option more helpful ! you might have to do a little homework on check out which shipment company give you the best price ; and instruct the seller/sender accordingly : ) alternately ; try look for those book in qatar ; i.e . in jarir bookstore .
 ani chy have give you the right answer . if you dont want to spend money on shipping charge you should find someone who be come from u.a.e and also willing to take you 9kg load free of charge but most probably a very difficult way .

 gratuity -40 day of basic salary he will get ; since he work 4 year .
 per qatar labor law : 21 day basic salary be gratuity for each year work . 4 year * 21 day * last daily basic pay = gratuity amount
 1-calculation of gratuity a per qatar labor law be 21 day basic salary of each year . if u work 5 year or more it will become 1 month basic salary instead of 21 day . 2 . each year u have a right to get 21 day leave salry ; if u not get in previous year ; u can claim for this also . 3 . all of the calculation base on the last basic salary u get . eg . suppose on the time of ur join ur basic salary be 5000 and now u r get the basic salary 7500 ; the calculation be base on the last one measns 7500 . 4 . if ur contract be defenit contract u should give 2 week notice inform ur resignation . if ur contact be indefinit duration contact u must give 1 month notice about ur resignation . other wise they can deduct 1 month salary or remain balance of day salary from ur settlement .
 about resignation ? one of my friend be work here in qatar for 4 year ; he be plan to resign and go back to his country of origin.he be ask do the company will give any seperation pay ? if yes ; how be it to be compute ? lenght of service or whatsoever ?
 he will get only gratuity that 21 day per year a per the last drawn basic ; apart from that legally nothing
 hello queenritz ! although the accommodation and transportation be provide ; the offer be really lame and you 'll see that wo n't be enough for your monthly expense . good luck !
 if you spend it moderately then ; 750qr be enough for the whole month food and other expense . you can save upto 2000qr ; if you spend the money correctly .
 very bad offer ; keep try well luck next time .
 can u tell which school u will join u can earn some money by tution also if it be bright future pakisatani school then it be good
 this to nasim ... . lol u make me laugh truely..he say qr.2750 means clear enogh he will spend qatari reyals..wat qr.750 for his food and and wat other expense ( intrnet ; tel ; laundry ; etc.. ) and save qr.2000 be realist man no matter how u moderat and tighten ur self unless u meant to spend qr.2000 and save qr.750 ! ! ? ? ? .. lol ... be u reply from india or where else on the moon . my dear it 's too low rate..try to negotiate harder it doesnt worth..unless u desperatly u need ajob
 you be young and i guess it your first time to work abroad . go for it ; do n't expect much . when u grow and get the experience ; then you can bargain for best offer . goodluck !
 2750 be too much for you . tell the management to reduce salary range 1500 to 1750 ; then they will definitely agree with you and you should think that teach profession be not for money ; it a charity too ...
 it would be enough but not satisfactory . just do your job very well and soon you can ask for an increase . regards
 all good housemaid will be employ by good family ... now all available be good for nothing. ! ! !

 14 ; 500 be a good salary and the bonus be a plus ; u will be pay the rent per month for a 2 bedroom fully furnish apartment between 7000 to 8000 qr ; around 300 for water and electricity bill ; then monthly budget for grocery approx . 1000 to 1500. so all in all maximum 10 ; 000 qr ; so will be save around 5 ; 000qr at least.u can save more depend on the life style u choose . life in qatar be good ; peaceful ; free of worry . so do n't worry take a chance ; it a good opportunity .
 you can find 1bhk semi furnish brand new flat include water and electricity in doha at qrs 3500-4000 per month . grocery ; 1000- 1500 qrs . petrol and other maintenance ; 300-500 if you have an economy car in good condition . telephone and internet ; 250-500 . so total monthly expense will come around 6500 - 7000 maximum . you can save half of your salary if you have a good plan . good luck go ahead this be a good job offer if the company and project be real .
 for single it be okay . but for married you wo n't be save anything . 1000-1500 living expense be good for one person only . house rent and food will eat most of your salary . transportation or car maintenance and education fee be an additional burden to your meagre salary .
 thanks for your inputs.felt this be a good salary by asian standards .
 i dont see anybody die here with a salary of 1000qr ... depend on your lifestyle ...
 yes it 's more than good and you do n't have a family so easily you can pay your home rent and your car car payment ; the rest of your salary you can do some shopping and spend a good time with friend
 how do he get a qatari driving license ( permanent ) without have a residence permit and id ?
 cherukkan ; he might have get the temporary dl and be confuse . they will not issue permanent dl without rp and id . a person on visit visa will not have a permanent dl of qatar and will not be able to buy a car .
 car transfer one of my friend be on visit visa in qatar ; he get permanent qatari driving license ; can he buy car on his name though he dont have residence visa ?
 please get your fact straight a you can not get a permanent drivers license without an rp . the license be link to your qid and bear the same number .
 the license be connect to the qatari id.. if the visa be cancel the license will have no meaning a well.. he be drive at his own risk similar to not have a license.. if he get a new sponsor and get a new qatari id he will again need to apply for a new license to be link to that new id .
 dohamarketing be right . you do n't need a driving license to buy a car but you need an rp to buy a car . his driving license be invalid a his visa be cancel and he should renew it after obtain the rp .

 if you be try to give someone a gift ; ask one of her friend . perfumes come in different smell to different people and there be perfume that be nice for hot weather and some in cold .
 hmm ... if you want to have a perfume in z low cost then i would say double horse or france club n if u want to in moderate one the ni say versace ; porche design ; 1001 night ( atar ) ; hugo or boss

 passport renewal can anybody give me any idea of how long will it take to renew a passport in the philippine embassy and how much will it cost me ?
 you need to have a valid passport of six month when you travel ! it 's safe you extend it now and when you come back ; have it renew here . there might be complication !
 i can extend it here in our embassy ? any idea how much it cost ? thanks for the reply
 passport extension will cost you 200 riyals..good for 3 month ... i think .
 give cash ... they will much like that way .
 gold always work and chocolate ; )
 iphone 5 ...
 it would be good to be specific that whom you be gon na present a gift . because woman at different age have different taste
 i think chocolate and money be very common gift but . if we think about the jewelry and pendant ; necklace or ring etc ; may be best gift for woman . i think jewelry be most beautiful thing that woman will definitely love . < img src= '' http : //images.doba.com/products/3863/mod '' height= '' 250 '' width= '' 250 '' > i find it at < a href= '' http : //ergode.com/christmas/gift-for-her '' rel= '' dofollow '' > christmas gift for her < /a > section of ergode .

 lp eating be there ... in the foreplay ... how can one abstain ? ! !
 lp ; be ur suggestion proven & test ? lol.. ohh ; i love eat chicken all the time ; so i 'd stick to chicken.haha just watch what u eat..check the calorie all the time ; eat healthy food ; & exercise of course ; following lp 's tip be up to u : )
 anyone on atkins diet ? show u some hand ! is anyone out there on an atkins diet ? i would like to know what you be currently eat ! it a bit thinner now but i 'm tired of eat chicken all the time . i want to eat something tasty . i know i 'm allow to eat a lot of other food ; so maybe you can help me out with your suggestion ? what 's your no-carb recipe ?
 trust me ; jack . when you 're in love you lose appetite .
 eh ? when ever i be in love ; i feel like eat more and more to make love ... .. : (
 if it 's true then i think i 've never be in love . : p
 gosh rizku - whatever
 lol tb ... . on a more serious note ... no diet will work without exercise . at the end of the day you need to move those muscle and do some exercise ... .. you can either walk or jog or anything u r comfy do but u have to get a move on . alongwith exercise a diet thats fat free and sugar free help a lot ... ...
 oh geez ; you need to exercise ! ? ! : p
 another alternative would be to use your brain excessively . it will burn calorie like hell . ( proven in many experiment ) .
 did n't atkins die grossly overweight ?
 he be slim because he be sick .
 lp that 's what happen when you watch too many episode of friends
 anyone on atkins diet ? show u some hand ! is anyone out there on an atkins diet ? i would like to know what you be currently eat ! it a bit thinner now but i 'm tired of eat chicken all the time . i want to eat something tasty . i know i 'm allow to eat a lot of other food ; so maybe you can help me out with your suggestion ? what 's your no-carb recipe ?
 i was/am on atkins quite frequently and lose weight also . but i find some problem like get hyper on staff/customers ; not be able to talk much etc etc . so i dont observe atkins regularly . may be two week on atkins and then break for some days/week and then again on atkins . yes atkins certainly help me in loose weight . foods you can include ( apart from chicken ) be eggs ( all type ) ; zero cola ; bottle gourd ; egg plant ; okra ; cheese ; fish ; tuna ; salad . one thing more be > > > lime juice once in day ( especially in morning before food ) . this be not recommend in atkins coz of bit high in carb but it help in make your food balance to more alkaline compare to acidic food .
 good for me . i do n't even know what you 're talk about ; tb .
 watch too many episode of friends and you become sick .
 i do n't watch 'episodes ' ; tb . only full length movie .
 accepted ; tb .
 but find it too depress . i just do the carb curfew thingy and still do it for maintain my weight ; so welcome all low carb food suggestion . and yes it do make order food from restos real hard after 5pm = (
 never try any diet ; never will ... .i `` live to eat '' : - )
 ultimately calorie counting will be anyones best bet.its actually quite easy once you get a hang of it . and ofcourse exercise.on that note right now the weather be just awesome for even walk !
 looks like i be doom to be chubby then . if loosing weight mean eat less and exercise i be sc***ed .
 well ; i never try get so fat and too skinny in my entire life.maybe it 's an advantage that i do n't like to eat something sweet . i eat chocolate once for two month or nothing at all . i just do n't like it . i do walk sometimes whenever i get the chance . i eat not too small not too plenty..but my weight be the same . i guess my physique be really like this..but sometimes ; i 'd still want to lose a few pound but my friend be tell me no need to lose anything..they tell me i 'm get paranoid sometimes.. : (

 you might have a heart attack due to high amount of colesterol in blood . scientifically not good .
 your mom 's among the privileged few ! baby fat be easy to loose compare to post pregnancy..been there ; do that =d
 i do n't know if you guy have read the article in the local english newspaper about some scientific finding that exercise be actually not the key to be skinny ... .i think that 's bull ; though . and anyway ; scientist always scar me . them and their `` finding '' . i do try to get exercise when i can ; which be not a lot of time since i 'm soooo busy lately . if i ca n't do that ; i go do atkins . i loooove eat ; and i get so guilty that i have to diet after . it 's like a yo-yo diet . not good ; i know ; but what do i do when i do n't have time for exercise ?
 i have find that atkins in qatar be really difficult ... i lose over 50kgs on it and keep it off for 3 year ( include 2.5years in qatar ) - then about 2 year ago ; i just could n't contain myself with all the good food - hummous ; arabic bread ; naan ; butter chicken ... etc ... techincally ; i should n't have have a much of a problem - you can eat kebab with rocket leaf and onion - or in salad - chicken do n't have to be your only option . brunch at a hotel on sundays be brilliant - berries ; egg and turkey/beef bacon ; sausage ; meat - thats all allow . what about make a smoothie of cream ; berry and ice ? omelettes with mushroom ; greem pepper ; dice chicken and cheeze ... . there be lot of choice ... . have you see this ... . http : //www.atkins.com/program/low-carb-online-tools.aspx there be a tab that will take you to meal plan and recipe ... . try it : - ) you have just inspire me to start again ... .
 wow ; 50 kg ! i do n't think i inspire you ... i think it be the other way around ! thanks for share . : ) from what i know ; i 'm not allow to eat fruit . berries be fruit ; right ? i 'm still in induction phase ; sorta . i 'm at it for almost 2 week now ; and believe you me ; i lose almost 3 kilo already ! it work ; it work ; it work people ! ok ; after the induction phase then i can start introduce carbs in my diet ... by now i 've no appetite for carbs ; really . i 've lose it couple of day ago . i 'm just bore with the same old food that 's all . i guess my problem be i 'm too tire to prepare something new and something on my own . lazy ; lazy ; lazy . eating out be a pain ; since if you eat steak ( which i loooove ) you get carbs a side dish . i do n't want to be tempt ! quickest way be the good ol ' chicken . i should n't complain i know . i 'm switch to kebab . thanks for the tip ; i 'm go to try out your suggestion !
 50 kgs ! thats like a whole adult female !

 its impossible to follow a diet right through your life ...
 its impossible for me to follow a diet right through the day jm ; )
 exercise be definitely the key . i use to work out for an hour and a half 5 day a week and be skinny a a rail . used to eat & drink whatever i want and would n't gain a pound . met my husband and change job ; suddenly the workout time disappears and 2 year later here i be 20kg heavy and struggle to lose it ; despite try every diet in the book . exercise ; exercise ; exercise !
 the main reason be the person be eat more than the body require ... .
 camels ... they be lightweight compare to me ; )
 never ever think of start a business in qatar . i know i sound stupid . but believe me . the rule be one hell of suck rule . if you go to the government office one day they will say one thing and second day they will say they dont want what they say on 1st day . i have be try to setup an organization here for the past 4 month . no luck at all . and believe me ; they want only want mnc to come to doha . im quit the idea of set up business here and go somewhere else . freaking government official and they f***ing rule .
 shaheka have a point ; either you have a strong wealthy well know sponsor or just find a mnc to support you . yalla !
 it be true that the rule be not clearly set out even we qataris have trouble sometimes with them but if you have a qatari partner/sponsor with good experience you can have your business up and run in a few months.. depend of course on the type of business and availability of the premise ; manpower ; resource etc..
 i dont think businessmen or lady chat in here..
 king ; excuse moi ?
 business in qatar what be the advantage of start a business in qatar than in other country ?
 really i never meet businessmen online what u do pittstop
 why not king-qatar ? we own our time more than govt employee !
 king ; what difference would it make ? lol -- i 'm an employee ; a business owner ; and a student .
 no qatarisun i 'm 100 % qataria..
 i believe that qatar now in it best state for start a business than it have ever be . i also believe qatar have advantage over many other countires in term of business especially in term of tax and charge . the only thing hold me from start a business be the good idea which i be seriously search for .
 victoria secret and ann summers would do nice business here.. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - `` he who dares wins '' derek edward trotter
 finally someone with good subject to discus ; thank you fembot i try to invest three time in qatar ; the regulation here be too complicate if i want to put it in a sentence then it be a follow : ( contacts and relationship be key for success in qatar ) i dont know when those people who be responsible for set up the process and procedure will realize that attract investment to qatar be not just by drop the tax 10 % ; no there be many other element that should be consider
 hasan ; qtr ; tax be not just drop to 10 % ; but infact new tax be introduce such a with hold tax ; guess in long run ; eventually goverment may collect more tax by introduction of new tax . allah hu akbar - god is great
 this be not true ; u have no idea how much it be difficult to start a new business in any other country ...

 can we bring our 40 day old baby with out a visa . i be work a a technician in a private company and my wife be work a a nurse in hammed hospital . but both of u be in different sponsorship . could you please advice ; can we bring our baby ( 40 day old ) without a visa and what be the document require .
 you surely need a visa and since your wife be work in hamad she can bring the baby on her sponsership .
 i think you can bring the baby within 40days why she do not deliver in qatar she be a nurse . when come attach both salary certificate and a letter from our sponsor noc that u can sponsor the baby.please wait for more response .
 well it be not possible to get your baby without a valid visa a you know now there be provision for a passport to be make for a new born .
 yes dear ; you can bring your baby without a visa upto 90 day old but with a valid passport.subjected your wife 's visa be still active..after enter to qatar you have to process residense visa within one month . you need ; birth certificate ( attest by minstry of foreign affair and qatar consulate in your country ) ; sponsor ( your wife ) visa and id copy ; bank statement ( 3mnths ) ; residential contract copy ; attest degree certificate ( rarely ask ) and of course photograph of baby . since your wife be not under your sponsorship ; before proceed check with her sponsor for additional requirements.good luck .
 hi shan yes you can bring your child ; visa will get on arrival ; i think now upto 60 day no visa need ; u have to bring attested birth cirtificate together . after arrival within 7 day u have to report authority .
 you dont have anything to do ; do you ?
 sister ; try the mall like city centre ; vilaggio . orelse u just have to keep call all the pharmacy . here be the link with all the number u need to call . http : //www.qtel.qa/impsearch.do ? catlist=7 & sublist=4 goodluck ! !
 it 's one of the most common medicine around but seem to have a shortage throughout qatar at the moment . it happen to quite a lot of medicine here . i would persevere and keep try small pharmacies . do n't bother phone ; actually go in as half the time the staff wo n't understand and it easy just to say no .
 my wife be on these supplement for low stomach acid ; she have not join me out here yet ; but we be go to get them send from the uk a we be n't sure if they be available here . it might be worth try the internet if you have a po box that they can be send to ; when my wife run out of them she find it helpful to eat an orange with a meal a this do increase the stomachs ability to break down the fat . do n't use a lemon a these turn alkiline in the stomach and make the problem worse . good luck

 the funny thing be that if the word `` temporary '' include in marriage ; the contract will be cancel . temporary + contract of marriage = `` not marriage ; but ... : p ''
 bad idea ... really wait ; take ur time ... u will meet someone who will be willing to spend the rest of his life with you and love u sincerely .
 yes ... .he can ... the procedure be know a `` harakiri ' and it work both way ! !
 another name ... . '' seppukku '' ..

 so it be well to remain a a mistress ; a others think it be very bad to be a second wife .
 at least u have the freedom ; and the wife have the right ; )
 ive known they have alot of expat like filipino/indians paramedic in hmc and plus they provide good accommodation for their staff single or family status .

 yes she must require an noc from previous employer if she want to work ; but anyhow on a family visit visa no body be allow to work .
 painting be very easy and a fun job to do . you can buy the paint at any jotun shop ; where they will mix it by computer to any shade you want . then get some roller and do it yourself . you will save a lot of money and you will feel so much good after you have complete the job . really reward . i love paint my house and have do everything myself . aisha-taweela
 can anyone recommend a painter ? the painter that our compound mgmt send over be clearly gouge u - he want 1 ; 500qr per room ; which be more than it would cost in the u.s. .. .and i know the guy here be make much much less than the immigrant labor in texas . any recommendation for someone who will do a good job for a fair price ? thanks ; expat sueo
 be what we spend for each room . they be more than rip you off . we go to jotun ( there be one in the same place a party kingdom near jaidah flyover ) and buy the paint there and contract with one of their worker . he would come over at night after his regular job be do . this be somewhat inconvenient ; but he be good and cheap !
 i end up find someone to paint the three room for 1 ; 000qr . it 's more than 200/room ; but he paint for a number of people in the compound and bring his own supply . i need to scurry on over to pick up the paint tomorrow ! cheer ; expat sueo
 do n't let me fool you . . .i 'm bless by plenty of bad luck a well . i have more `` strange bad luck story '' than you could possibly imagine !
 dear ; than you should close to god always pray for your luck . its doest not matter . i do n't know anything about luck . i 've never bank on it ; and i 'm afraid of people who do . luck to me be something else ; hard work and realize what be opportunity and what isn't/ when the good luck come - ready to receive it . always count yourself in lucky persons.. thanks
 the person who come do it for 1 ; 000qr and do a fantastic job . the guy who want to do it for 4 ; 500 must have be smoke something !
 alwyas count ur life with smiles ...
 do u have phone number for guy who do ur painting ; pm me thanks
 the 200 and the 1500 sound logical . it really depend on the extent of work . it could be simple painting and apply one or two layer of normal paint . it could be also a complicate task which involve scrap ; prim then do several layer of paint . ===================================== http : //www.qatarliving.com/node/58409

 `` driving a vehicle load in such a way that it cause damage to people and surroundings '' - this usually mean speeding and it be catch by the radar at traffic light if you cross the speed limit for that road . you can go to traffic dept at old airport or madinat khalifa and request to see a video of the violation . ur dad can tell if it his car and move accordingly . the place zone can often be mislead due to error in data entry . but time will be accurate ; only our mind play trick on timing . worth check out the video than speculate .
 it happen with me once and they mention that drive a car which be above 50 meter or the level allowd in website and when i check in arabic then i find out it a seat belt panelty ... when they enter in there system at traffic dept they enter in arabic and then system be translate in silly enligh option which be enterd already from there side at traffic dept .
 this comment appear only incase of speeding and catch by radar ( salwa roads or corniche ; elsewhere )

 a ticket on line and i make a enquiry also online and explianed that i be at work at the time of the incident . the violation disappear . make sure you be inputting the proper type of license plate . cars be private vehicle and truck be private transportation ; do n't pay someone else 's fine by accident ; unless it 's mine . i do n't think we need to do anything in the name of god ; he 's a big boy and can take of himself .

 i would 've wish for the al-jazeera to be the most honest ; would 've be absolutely proud ; but i 'm afraid it 's not ; although it have all the mean to become one . maybe their policy will change ? salam
 i think they will grow and mature . but if they want to be view a anything but an anti-western mouthpiece they will need watch their editorial bias . fox do n't care about such thing and be happy to be see a the right wing network it be . i would hope that a-j do n't follow that same path . they be position ( and fund ) to make great contribution international medium . unfortunately ; as long a they allow someone 's politics to color their reporting ; they will be marginalize . i think you get the best sense of what 's go on by watch a lot of different news . i watch bbc ; cnn ; aje ; and msnbc . i even occasionally fox so i can see what the enemy be up to : - ) < strong > i refuse to drink the kool-aid ! < /strong > -- < em > pm < /em >

 any local channel would have extensive coverage of their leader ' international visit . egyptian nile tv cover mubarak 's visit of where he go ; who he meet with ; what he have for lunch ; when he play squash ; who he shake hand with ; and how many step he climb up to get back to the plane ; en route to egypt.. : ) this be so boring ! salam
 i do n't think there be objectivity in any news channel let alone truthful information ... even if a certain tv news channel be truthful ; it will focus on issue that be of interest to her which do not make thing objective . however ; i would vote for the arabic al-jazeera .
 check many other channel to confirm news ( like investigate history ) or discovery channel ... . personally i feel al jazeera show directly from horse mouth and do n't involve personal commentary on the subject ... . from india most reliable be ndtv ; times now and headlines today ... international news ... bbc ; cnn ... .. pakistan geo
 i like al jazeera in arabic ; like fox be a propaganda machine for u.s right wing al-jazeera be a propanganda machine ; i never hear about domestic issue of arab world properly in al jazeera . so i love the arabic version escipially the advertisments which be a big relief .
 i be mainly refer to regional channel ; do n't know about the rest of the world 's local news channel . but imagine have to put up with 20 minute of list the name of every single member at the leader 's reception ! oh ; and of course all internal affair be good and satisfactory.. : ) salam

 i think that you might have leave it a bit late.. as you will travel through saudi arabia to uae then you require a transit visa . normally ksa embassy here in qatar stop issue transit visa about two week before the eid.. the rest of the trip be not worth mention if youhave not this first step..
 it be too late now tess ; plan in advance minimum 2 week for next eid ; give me a pm and i will provide the detail include map ; distance in kms ; etc .
 it too late now you should ask for visa atleast before 15 day
 i need logic answer please not dream answer
 what good do you see in dubai . qatar be good than dubai i would say . < img src= '' http : //www.qatarliving.com/files/images/da.gif '' >
 ya i know it grow now but the final i think will be after 50 or 100 nyears to be central country
 what do u mean by hopefully not tallg ? ? ? ?
 agree with tallg & darude `` < i > an end does not justify the means < /i > ''
 do you think qatar will be like dubai ? do you think qatar will be like dubai after how many years ? ? ? ?
 qatar be much good than dubai . too commercial for me . qatar be unique and i think ; will stay that way .
 +1 tallg ; you beat me to it . rasha ; how many souqs do dubai have ? i 've only ever see one . malls ; gee whiz ; i can shop anywhere . cafes ; ? we have plenty . what do dubai have that i 'd like to see here ? 1 . wild wadi 2 . a go kart track 3 . a decent international airport terminal . 4 . ace hardware ! 5 . bacon . 6 . reasonably clean public beach . 7 . better drivers . 8 . decent rock show . but do i need all those ? not really . < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/photos/b '' title= '' west bay panorama april 2009 by baldrick2dogs ; on flickr '' > < img src= '' http : //farm4.static.flickr.com/3388/3450023228 '' width= '' 240 '' height= '' 68 '' alt= '' west bay panorama april 2009 ''
 i do n't have problem to love qatar but you must admit that it not fully country still need lot of thing to be more intresting and more usful not for work only non qatari people in qatar come for work so they work the hole day and in the weekend feel boaring that nothing to do except shop in mall i think this be not good life cz also qatari when they wan na have good time traviling to dubai ... .
 rasha ; ask yourself ; `` why do dubai have all the thing qatar do n't ? '' you should find the simple answer that dubai 's oil and gas reserve be dwindle and they be boost tourism a a revenue earner . qatar be sit on a huge gas bubble and do n't < i > need < /i > tourism as much . and at the end of the day ; if you like dubai and what it have to offer so much ; you could always move there ; but till then ; be satisfy with what you adopt host country have to offer . < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/photos/b '' title= '' west bay panorama april 2009 by baldrick2dogs ; on flickr '' > < img src= '' http : //farm4.static.flickr.com/3388/3450023228 '' width= '' 240 '' height= '' 68 '' alt= '' west bay panorama april 2009 ''

 < i > you be right . it will take 1-2 decade to be like dubai but still will not be like dubai . . and we all can imagine that after 1-2 decade ; where will be dubai ... ... ... . ufffffff i can not even think of it . so beautiful ; so advanced but i hope there will be no traffic problem at all in those coming day . < /i > -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - < strong > everybody wish they could go to heaven but no one want to die. < /strong >

 rasha - because i do n't like dubai ; and would be disappoint if qatar ( doha ) turn out the same .
 and if any body can guess what qatar will look like after 25 year which country will be similar or will be unqiue but i dont think that qatar will have own style qatar will take part from each country to bulid her civilization a islamic museaum nothing relate to qatar it iranian and syrian and egyptian art nothing realted to qatar cz on that time qatar be tribe that set and if all the expat get out of qatar will return to be tribe again cz expat who make qatar any one can answer
 qatar today be like dubai five year ago !
 do you think qatar will be like dubai ? do you think qatar will be like dubai after how many years ? ? ? ?

 left dona know what da right hand be doin . and very rude with phonecalls and thelike
 i have no complains at all ; we be move from dubai ; go in june for interview and they be lovely and so far very helpful with everything else through email
 does anyone know what sort of teacher this school will have ? we be so fedup with `` foreign legion '' teacher at these sort of school
 go to http : //www.sherborne.org/page/sherborne and you can check out their biography
 btw luchy ; do you have some connection with sherborne school ?
 piggly-riggly you mention that you have so many issue but you have n't name one so far . what issue do you have ? my personal experience have be that the staff be very helpful from day one and i have n't have any issue .
 i have recently enrol my son in sherborne and i think they be excellent . we have no complaint .
 sherborne qatar has anyone else have problem deal with the school ? they seem very uncertain over so many important issue .
 well ; it be a pleasant change to hear this from a parent whose child be at a school in qatar .
 not yet ... .
 actually sherborne be the second high fee chanrging school after the ameriacn school of doha.. asd ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - `` he who dares wins '' derek edward trotter
 what 's unusual be that you get what you pay for . with many of the school in doha you can pay a fortune and still not receive a good education .
 even if sherborne double thier fee tomorrow ; i would still send my son there . its worth every penny .
 qatbrit have use the right 'their ' and 'there ' in her message - have i miss something ? ? ! having just visit a number of school in qatar i be very much impress with the importance place on learn the 3'rs in primary school . i know for a fact in the uk that in british school the spelling be appal - teacher do n't want to correct mistake just in case the feeling of the child be knock ! ! i personally find doha college to be way above it station - unable to respond to email request a visit and then when they do ; they could not arrange a whole school visit require u to visit twice if we want to see both primary and secondary . i will not bother - i can not image how they would deal with a case of bully if a whole school visit be beyond their capability . maybe they do n't need more pupil come to their school - i do know that rest on your laurel be never good . i expect the teacher at doha college be good but if their administration be as weak a it appear parent will take their child elsewhere for fear of bad management . first impression still count !
 how much can the extra go up to a sherborne ? are those usually cover by the company ? and how have you folks find the school so far ? it seem to offer a lot of extra-curricular activity and have a good backing . any other school that you 'd recommend - my son be 6 and 3.5 cheers
 qabrit - i be assumng your company be pay here ; ) do they also cover the extra ? cheers
 hi ; i be a mother of a 6 yr old boy and be look for a good school in doha . i recently get a call for an opening for my son at sherborne.i be confuse a i have also hear about asd that it also a very good school . as yr child be in sherborne ; can you please let me know how the school be ? should i opt for sherborne or wait for asd to reply ? how be the teacher at sherborne ? hows the atmosphere ? be u satisfy ? please let me know your feedback . i will really appreciate . thanks ;
 sherborne qatar be a school run a a business making profit . it be own by one of the al-thani mob . there be lot of problem with this school . many higly experienced teacher leave after just one year and a another teacher recently quit . they have try to set up a british prep school in the desert - it just do not work . few of the remain staff have much international experience - most of them be snobby type from the uk with little overseas experience or knowledge about arab custom . the organisational of the school be poor - reactionary management . contact with the head be limit . they have a board of govenors make up of pompous type . there be very few decent school option in qatar and it look like that sherborne qatar will never live up to the advertised promise . avoid for now - far too many problem relate to cultural adjustment .
 sherborne qatar has anyone else have problem deal with the school ? they seem very uncertain over so many important issue .
 susan chang ; you make lot of claim but what be your proof ? do you have or do you have a child at sherborne ? my personal experience a a qualified teacher ; who have support many of the student at sherborne ; have be very positive . in fact i be sceptical about how well a new school could do in it first year . i have be quite surprise by what they have achieve so far both academically and in term of student ' holistic development .
 my proof be that i be friend with several teacher and family currently at the school or who have recently leave . i stand by all i have say . there be really no decent school in qatar . it be absurd to think you can set up a british prep school in the middle of the desert . the whole operation be a business shum run for money - a profit making venture trading upon a famous name . there be a bunch of pompous uk govenors who have a lot of egg on their face at the moment and be do everything to avoid swallow their pride . the only reason the majority of the teaching staff do not leave last year be because they be grant a 10 % lump cash sum payment to basically remain hush and avoid speak out . what more would you like to know ? the only reason the school survive it first year be because of the teacher ; not for any other reason . the same can be say for many if not all the school in qatar .
 quite frankly any school in doha indirectly help to sustain a corrupt system of government ( a family dynasty ) ; that directly depend on the mass importation of hundred of thousand of poor people from country like nepal ; bangladesh ; india and pakistan . these people be totally exploit and treat like modern day slave . they survive on about 800 qr a month . no school in doha can deny that they indirectly help to sustain such a system . that be why i say that there be no good school in doha . their moral foundation be corrupt . it have nothing to do about ivy league university . decent people should get out of this sham of a country . sherborne uk have jump into bed with a corrupt family and have have their finger badly burn . they now lack integrity and all that they propose they stand for back in the uk .
 we move from dubai too and my kid be go to the same school ; they seem to be alright however i be not quite sure about how strong be they in their acadamics
 but use your own logic ; you and your husband job ( or you emotionally support your husband decision to work here in qatar ) be sustain your employer ; who in turn ; be `` sustain corrupt family monarchy who deny their citizen and visitor basic human right and freedom '' . therefore the only logical option open to you be to leave . this be the first time i have suggest that anyone should leave qatar - but unfortunately this be the corner you have paint yourself into .
 first of all ; the only reason sherborne establish a branch here because it 's part of the supreme council of education `` education for a new era '' outstanding schools initiative . which be a rand initiative ( if you know what i mean ) .so far ; qatari student account for less than 10 % of the total number of student . most qataris enroll their offspring in government school . overall ; private school target expatriate who work here ; and the fact be most of the expatriate who enroll their offspring in private school receive education allowance from their employer and let 's be honest ; most of you wish deep inside that your country be a monarchy . the immigrant be suck your resource dry ; degrading your national health & education system . despite all that your salary be deduct a tax to pay for the welfare of those immigrant . and yet ; you get to pay for utility ; )
 hello genesis ; would you adopt a affirmative or negative viewpoint ? schools like sherborne have put into place racially discriminatory quota system of not enrol more than 20 % qatari student ; not 10 % a you do suggest . of course sherborne can get away with this in qatar and would never be able to implement such an unfair policy back in the uk . your paragraph about immigrant suck the national health and education system dry be sheer nonsense . a simple and poorly worded opinion without evidence or substance . as for adley ; i be pleased that you have manage to reach some sort of conclusion . i really think that all highly trained western expats include yourelf should leave qatari ; not just me ! more debate be require .
 school demographic be an issue in the uk just as much a it be in qatar . it be difficult to maintain a high standard of learn if a large proportion of student in a classroom be not fluent in the language of instruction . the way most private school in the uk address this issue be by set a limit on the percentage of non-native speaker of english . otherwise ; the majority of the population in these school would consist of indian and chinese student . this be because of the sheer volume of applicant from these two country . in qatar those school ; with a small population of first language english speaker ; such a qis and al-jazeera academy ; tend not achieve the same standard a those with more first language speaker . this do not mean that those student who be not fluent in english be less able but it do show that not be fluent in a language can be a barrier to learning .
 academic integrity of school 2 effectiveness of administration 2 academic and disciplinary support provide 2 director 's involvement in academic 2 fair and equitable treatment by board and director 2 school have adequate educational material on hand 5 attitude of local community towards foreigner 5 cost of living in relation to salary ( 10= most favorable ) 3 satisfaction with housing 2 community offer a variety of activity 6 availability and quality of local health care 6 assistance with visa ; shipping and air travel 1 extra curricular load be reasonable 5 comments : sheikha aisha own and operate this substandard 'international ' school . do n't be fool ; it 's an international school in theory but an islamic school for delinquent al thani child . all the student that have be expel or refuse entrance to another school know they can attend doha academy . mr. farouk ; head of the secondary school ; be abully who rule through intimidation . he have his minion who follow him around like hungry puppy hop that he 'll throw a bone their way . anyone who dare to stand up to him be a target of his . he derive immense pleasure in humiliate and demoralize student . how this man be ever appoint in a school boggle the mind . sheikha aisha ; the owner/operator ; be notorious for not honor contract . foolishly i think that once a contract be agree to and sign ; it would be honor . not so . she have blatantly break contract because she decide she do n't want to pay airfare . the sheikha be a dishonest ; disreputable woman who be only after two thing ; money and prestige . she 's get plenty of cash from the parent but refuse to reinvest it in the school . working for sheikha aisha be a miserable experience . now that she have turn the day to day operation over to mr. ali a head of secondary girls and mr. farouk a head of secondary boy ; the school will take a dramatic downward spiral . ( as an aside ; both mr. ali and mr. farouk have in the past be take to the police for assault on student . these assault take place during normal school hour . members of staff intervene in order to stop the altercation from become a brawl . yet ; they remain thanks to the sheikha . ) unless you want to work for and be sponsor by a woman who have zero integrity ; no qualm about break a contract and no ethic ; run a million kilometer in the opposite direction . no one of any repute should ever consider work at this school .
 wow susan..those be pretty inside stuff you 're bring out . i 've my child go to sherborn in reception and so far i 'm pleased with the teacher and school system . though this be my first year and i 've yet to explorer . but my child be happy . i guess what ever happen in the background as long a it do not direclty effect the teching quality . but assault the student be a serious crime if this be true .
 sherborne qatar has anyone else have problem deal with the school ? they seem very uncertain over so many important issue .
 we be all look for the same standard of education they we get at home ; and if we be put our child into a private school ; then the standard should be even high . not see this with sherborne ; they be do what all the other school do and that 's drop the level because they have too many 2nd langugage student . sherborne ; be be fill with too many child to soon just to but bum on seat ; and run on it 's reputation from the uk . it have no western admin staff ; a balance would nice . why be that private school be run with 22+ in class ; in england a private operate with 12 maybe 15 . the homework be shock ; no grammar ; no comprehension ; no math ; science ; history ; french ; geography yet to have this term ... .thinking about move my child if thing do not improve .
 keep your cat fight inside the school itself
 v.good stuff ; but crowd class

 it will work for 15 day from the date of enter the country . i use my int . drivg license for 2 week and then i make a qatari one .
 it is valid for 6 months from the date you enter the country it is written in qataris law

 petrol be cheap than water ; you should be ask about a car that doesnt break down and be easy to fix because mechanic here be just terrible ; ive see pothole smarter than some mechanic in qatar
 saed be right ; here in qatar ; we have to look for availabality of mechanic and cost of spare part ; for that ; car of nissan or toyota be best choice
 < b > suzuki swift or corolla or alto or lancer or ... ... ... ... .. damn everything be expensive nowadays
 by tell economic you mean everthing and not only petrol cost ( spare part ; maintenence ; resell value ; insurance & registration fee ) ; all be available in toyota car . this be the situation in qatar only toyota everywhere even i do n't like toyota & i be not use toyota & i will never buy toyota !
 camel..only grass he will eat.my very good friend ssantro love camel a lot . moreover camel will give you loving stare too sometimes not like a bumpy humpy car demanding to go to service after every 1000 mile or 2000 mile . camel you can bath with water and nobody will object and if you will give shower to car all your neighbour will try to kill you by complain to the authority . go for a camel .
 lucy..camel will be too high to ride on ; good to buy a donkey . but the big problem be where he can find grass for him ? sure petrol here be cheap than grass .
 can camel eat ... bread ... rice or vegetable : )
 ofcourse not u saedkhan.. u'r always wrong

( avoid french or americans ! ! ) ... .. plus hey the car be vote the best car many time over ... ..toyotas be it vios 's aygo 's or corolla and nissan sunnys and the suzuki lot be over rat ... .. final comment : - 2010 or 2009 nissan tiida 1.8 se with alloy rim might not be as cheap a the others but thts value for ur money right there and a good investment
 would be to buy a printing press ... ...
 you apply at immigration on the appropriate form ... ... it 's as simple a that !
 which office ? what doc require ? how much i need to pay ?
 ist get the copy of passport and photo for your parent . get a letter of your salary status from your employer ( well in arabic ) .then go to immigration department in madina khalifa . there be typesets who will provide and type form of visa application . after just follow their instruction that where and how to submit . best of luck
 so i suppose you have a `` not small '' company with a mandoob . if you have one ; talk to him to get an accurate answer ( and if there be anything to clear ; he 's just there in your company ) . or go to immigration office or visit their website ( but i suggest you go directly ) to ask for all the requirement
 might take 1 month
 it depend on the hr manager ; when he sign your offer letter and releases it ; max it can take upto a month ...
 they be not interested
 it do take time for overseas recruitment .
 how long qatar airway tak to snd offer lettr ? interview be complete and provisional offer be discuss and it be inform that they would send me the final offer letter within a week time . but it 2 week now . anyone have any inputs/experiences on how long it usually take for qr to process the offer roll out and then visa processing ?
 no time limit ... it could take more than 1 month to make ready final offer letter . then visa processing also can take another more than 1 month . but everything depend on various component ... ..
 i think i will wait some more before take a final stand ... issue be they be not very approachable over phone .
 it depend sometimes more than a month ...
 please advise a i be also wait for their job offer ; howver ; i find the vacancy for which i be apply and be accept be post at qatar visitors..
 pea guyzz when do u get your write offer from qa after one month or more than it
 cccccccccccccc
 it will take almost 2 month for overseas recruitment ... .. patience be virtue : ) ... you have to wait : )

 how come free visa where u can find free visa in qatar be u sure ?
 free visa if someone come to qatar in a free visa ; be it necessery to get noc from the person who be provide ( sponser ) the visa before employ in some other organization ?
 there be no free visa
 there be no visa call 'free visa ' all employment visas be the same.usually the sponsor will not allow those who be under their sponsorship to work for other compnaies ; but some sponsor do allow to work for others by take some reward from the employee and these be refer a free visas .
 there is no free visa in qatar.you have to work with sponsor or with other sponsor with permission of govt or illegaly ; that be not advisable .
 what do you mean by `` free '' visa ?
 well there be no visa called free visa all visas be employ visa ; the difference be only that the sponsor do allow you to work upon your choice for that you have to obtain a noc letter from existing sponsor which should be endorse by immigration dept . it a permit to work in another sposorship which be valid for six month and than later on you have choice to change sponsorship accord to your choice but the new visa do not allow you to change sponsorship until you finish the first year ... ..regards ... . - naeem -

 post it so we can see what it say ; where be it from and other such important information . ca n't really comment on it without know any of the fact .
 i have not recieved a email to stat this but even if i have i would ignore it my kid never get a flu vaccine when we live in uk so i wont be give them one living here in doha but this be just my pereference
 the sec will issue consent form for child to receive seasonal flu vaccination . we understand that these form will be issue on sunday 4 october ; to be return on monday 5 october . the intention be to begin vaccination against seasonal flu as soon a possible . they confirm that without the consent of parent they will not vaccinate child . h1n1 vaccine be not yet available more news from the sec on this will be forthcoming in due course . the sec have no plan to vaccinate adult in school at this stage .
 i be not a medical person ; and would like to know the advantage and dissavantages of give this to my child ; also if the advantage outways the dissavantage ; because i would feel quilty if something happen to my child due to my refusal to give her this vacination .
 please all remember this vaccination be only for seasonal flu and not the h1n1 strain . so think before sign do you really need it ? it will not protect your child from swine flu..

 not sure about qatari labour laws ; but our company give 7 day for such leave .
 marriage leave dear all i would like to know that be there any rule in qatar labor law which state that a person can get a marriage pay leave for certain amount of time ? your answer and suggestion would be greatly appreciate .
 depends on your company..we get 10 day marriage pay leave : p
 it amaze me that a qatari ask such question ; think they would no more than the rest of u . i suppose though marriage be a death ; either to the husband ( slow and linger ) or to the wife if she change her name ; the birth of a new woman ( already mature ) and the death of the old a the name no long applies .
 no man ; there be no such leave in labor law ; u gon na take it from ur annual leave balance .
 nothing .
 you can wear whatver you want as long a it doesnt draw attention to yourself . clothes that cover you and dont show too much skin be ok. you can wear skirt or trouser or jean or dress . as long a there be not too much skin show anything be ok ... welcome to doha !
 yes i guess tinkerbell have kind of sum it up . skirts up to knee roll be ok i guess.. : ) welcome to doha
 you have to remember that qatar be a conservative muslim country by law ; but a with most place a lot of the rule be bent here . the one thing you have to remember which be state before you do not want to wear something that be to reveal so that people do not give you a hard time . for female you can wear whatever you want but then you have to deal with the after math of have inappropriate comment be make and in some case harassment from both the people and the police . for men it be a lot easy but some time the same problem arise . so the best advice i can give be that you dress for the summer but nothing to revealing .
 you can wear everything in moderation ; a qatar be a conservative country
 you do good than i do ; be yours non-stop ?

 how can i get a job in th oil industry when i have no experience in the field and minimal relative education ? i 'm look to obtain work out of canada or do business elsewhere ; simply because i need a change . any 'short cut ' any suggestion would be greatly appreciate .
 good question my friend . i start in the oil industry 20 year ago with no experiance or reletive qualification . 20 yeras on i 'm now work for an oil company in qatar but to start with i start work for a service company . drop me an e-mail through qatar living and i will try and give you few pointer in the right direction
 short cuts might benefit you only for a short period . there be no short cut to success accord to me . if you have luck by your side ; you can do miracle ; if you dont then you need to struggle the hard way . oil & gas industries dont have kid run the show ; professional experience and solid education back ground be need in these sector . good luck
 it be not necessary to have oil relate experience or education to get a job in the oil industry . all kind of profesional be need in the oil industry be it on it ; engineering ; legal ; medical or even teacher .
 1- find the name of a many oil company and contractor a posible ; prepare a good cv ( resume ) use the best of your knowledge focus in what ever you know how to do best ( do n't lie ) ; give a title to your cv ( for example : hr officer ; secretary ; tea boy what so ever ) now apply online and personally against all position available relate to the field you know best . 2- keep your phone with ya ; you do n't want to miss a call ! ! while wait for any interview appointment ; go to get urself a good suit and polish your shoe lol ( shave and cut ur hair ) ; you only get one chance to make a good impression and be lucky enough to have `` the golden opportunity to `` develope ur new career '' ; be confident at all times. `` that should do it '' good luck !
 yes u have to take return ticket

 why be it pompous ? my thought be my own ; but i doubt my mum would agree with some of them .

 i do ; but i think it take 2 day to appear . at least right now ; there be no fine there .

 there be camera at the tornado tower intersection and at the cbq tower intersection near the general post office . you get catch if you jump a red light . good luck .
 i eventually do n't receive a ticket ; which mean that if you mistakenly cross the light while orange on your side of the intersection ; and become red by the time you reach the other end of the intersection ; you should be fine .

 which airway offer the best fare from doha to houston ; usa i be look for the best fare flight from doha to houston ; it be no need to be directly flight . anyone can suggest me ?
 best fare or best flight ... . i once have a cheap klm flight ; through amsterdam ( a 24hour flight ) i prefer the direct qatar airways flight ( preferably in business class ) it 's a direct doh-iah 17h flight ( 10am to 5:30pm same day ) the flight back be a 15h flight ( 7:45pm to 7:45pm next day ) ... timezone difference make the number seem illogical : )
 like mention before ; qatar airways be the best bet . a flight from doha to houston will be around 1400 usd depend on the time of year you go . for example ; a flight near christmas time would be a couple hundred dollar more expensive . i 've search take a long flight with layover and it be always over a thousand more so it 's sooo not worth it .
 great idea . total cleanliness . what more can you want .

 rizks ; yes they replace mine three time free of charge for only 220qrs each time they change it .
 `` free of charge '' ? and then you pay 220 qr each time they do ? that 's whati call `` free of charge . ''

 when you hard reset on your router ; make you know your phone number which be your account as well with qtel . usually for residence ; it 's : s44xxxxxx and password : 123 for the new installed line . usually for the old one ; just : s4xxxxxxx .

 @ seantrump ; call qtel again to come then prepare cat6 cable from their main box to your adsl ( white ) box inside the house . i dont how long the cable you will need . but they do n't provide it for u . that 's the problem with qtel ; not a full service .
 newkidontheblock ; thank you again for the advise.i 'll try the linksys router first then if it wou n't work i 'll have it checked.appreciated
 cabbage ; be think though probably the modem/router need some cooling off.i 'm plan to give it a dip in ice cold beer .

 guys to check if there be a cable problem try go to www.pingtest.net and do a ping test . click on begin test and let it choose a good server automatically . check your packet loss ; if high then cable issue . then to check your download and upload speed go to www.speedtest.qa . i have some problem with mine ; then change the router and also find out my connection be downgrade from 4mb to 1mb and take them 2 week to fix that ; but it all good now .
 cabbage ; my dear i think the problem with my modem/router be contageous.i would n't wan na be drink that beer and then transfer the problem to me.then you 'll be have a seantrump ' `` seantrump error ; temporarily disconnect '' . cabbage ; i be sell my modem would you wan na buy it for like 250qrs.a brand one cost 220qrs.what do you say ? lol

 water ; unlike in western world it be very essential in asian country ... . for your knowledge here people clean with water not with paper ... . and the thing about water be spill here and there that be a princess say just ignorance and bad cleaniness manner ... ..
 alexa agreed with your point ... .western people be definately not dirty after use paper and remain dry after use toilet ... but atleast you should not point out or question like comikalee do ... .it be the way of life here ... . people feel clean after use water ... ..
 lol ... ... ... ... i wish that be an option for me . lol
 westerners continue with your habit of use paper and not water ... this way we can save water ... .

 in the 60 's the uk health department advise to use water hose against toilet paper in the public school in order to stop typhoid spread among childrens ; sorry i do n't find the link . and hasan be right to a certain extend ; you ca n't clean that `` place '' toroughly only if use water ; this be common sense . i will not say westerner be dirty people ; but i look at this type of hygiene -paper- totally disgust . and a body with no smell do n't automatically mean a clean body . use a whole roll if you want ; this be nothing compare to a well guided water spray ; lol ! < a href= '' http : //s464.photobucket.com/albums/rr6/dawestsidesscreaming/ ? action=view & current=291589im9sf5.gif '' target= ''  '' > < img src= '' http : //i464.photobucket.com/albums/rr6/dawestsidesscreaming/291589im9sf5.gif '' border= '' 0 '' alt= '' photobucket '' > < /a > hardcore gamer !
 could not have agree more .
 recently i have visit doha from canada for two day . three thing catch my attention right away 1 . water in public washroom ; even at the airport . 2 . speed limit and drive style 3 . i saw one kid ( 2-3 yr old ) ; with no child seat and seat belt on which be pretty scary . i think it be nothing wrong with use water in a washroom ; this be just some people do not have courtesy to leave it clean for the next person . qatar be one of the rich country ( per caput income in 2007 be more than 80k i guess ) on this planet ; so it be fair to expect that everything should be nice and clean in this country . hopefully i do not hurt anybody 's feeling .
 i 'm not say that westerner stink ... but again i consider the use of toilet paper a an improper and inappropriate habit ; this be dirty ! i prefer to see water spill than a used piece of paper ; or a roll that have be manipulate by dozen of finger ... < a href= '' http : //s464.photobucket.com/albums/rr6/dawestsidesscreaming/ ? action=view & current=291589im9sf5.gif '' target= ''  '' > < img src= '' http : //i464.photobucket.com/albums/rr6/dawestsidesscreaming/291589im9sf5.gif '' border= '' 0 '' alt= '' photobucket '' > < /a >
 public toilet should have drain in the floor ; and the floor should be build so the foul water flow into the drain rather than form puddle . i would equally complain if dirty bog-roll be leave strewn all over the bathroom ; so i think there 's no excuse for leave excrement-laden spray cover the cubicle . however ; the problem would be much less apparent if the water drain away properly .
 toilets in doha be disgust and a disgrace ! ! ! when you arrive at doha airport and want to use the toilet ( speaking of the lady ' of course ; ca n't comment on the gent ' ) the first impression of doha be not good ! ! ! only 2 toilet cubicle ; both dirty and swimming in dirty water and overflowing bin . why oh why ca n't they build decent toilet in this country ? ? the toilet in the new mall esp . villaggio be horrible ! ! cheaply construct from formica - water and dirty paper everywhere . is it really so difficult ? ? go to the malls/hotels/ airport in dubai and you can see the difference . why ca n't it be the same here ? ? i will do anything to avoid use public toilet here ; which be sometimes very inconvenient ; but i do n't want to bare my b*m to these hellhole ! !
 i think the bad i 've see in any shopping mall be the gent loos in landmark . there 's dried shit stain up the wall and dead roach in the light fitting . it baffle me how anyone feel happy shopping for food after use those toilet .
 hasan you have got to be kid me ; what the hell be you on about only reason to why bathroom stink here be not because of the people who use them ; or the way that they use them ; it because those shopping center or hotel dont fork over the necessary money to keep them clean ; no proper maintenance ; cheaply build and no proper clean up staff ... ..

 the public toilet in qatar be revolt . if they be not swim in diluted shit ; there 's 300 men with there hand and foot in the sink ; spit in every direction . yesterday i stand next to a man and his child in the toilet in city centre ; whilst they cleanse themselves in the urinal . ffs ; wheres the hygiene in that ! ! !

 toilet at city center and specially the cinema side be the bad i have ever see in my life they stink even from far away
 i have question about the hose thing ... .. 1 ) how do you know you have all the faecal matter off ? ? so finger physically touch faeces ? ... nice 2 ) do you use the paper afterwards to ensure all have be remove and to also dry off one bum ? 3 ) if one do n't use paper to dry surely it would cause soreness ? 4 ) how come the water go everywhere ? 5 ) surely the backsplash from the faecal/urine fill toilet water land directly back on one netheregions ? i 'm not convince ... one have to use paper somewhere along the line water all over the floor which i dread to think what lurk in it be quite disgusting and unacceptable ... ..

 in the public toilet ... because the person use do not mind others and sometimes ; irresponsible customer just leave their mess without even clean and flush afterwards .
 ohhhh ; that say it all then ... ... .
 i 'm always curious at the guy who like to linger by the urinal smoke a cigarette in the city center cinema toilet . we have name for men who like to hang around by urinal in other country ...
 all this talk of toiletary taboo might help explain the incredibly high rate of sterility amongst the local population . it ca n't be clean have so much urine and faeces swirl around on the floor ; wall and mist into the air . perhaps that 's why the local men and woman have so much trouble conceiving .
 fubar ? ? ? most of the local family i 've see have be huge ?
 hasan shaikh say yeah . in the western world ; ... yeah . in the western world ; the toilet be clean ; but people be not . @ hasan shaikh u say it

 go to disneyland where it be far more crowded than any place in qatar and you wo n't smell any stink from western people ! here in qatar it be such an ordeal to stand in queue in some public place or in huge crowd because of smelly stinky odor from certain folk who do not believe in wash their body and clothes before venture in public again ; have you ever see filthy bathroom than here : landmark ; city center ; waqif ; hyatt ; villagio ; mcdonalds ; burger king ; ... ... . everywhere ! ! ! ! ! why be dubai so much good ? why mosques in dubai be 100x clean than doha ? ? ? ? ?

 i be stagger by the filth in the public toilet at souq waqif . i 'd rather piss against a wall than set foot in those toilet again . whoever be 'running ' souq waqif be useless . the place be an utter embarrassment for tourist in that regard . if you want anyone to have a meal and spend more than an hour there ; they will need toilet ... and this be the number 1 place to take tourist in qatar ? i guess it 's a true reflection of the filthy attitude of many people in this country . no wonder western tourist hate the place .
 if so many people be so disgust by it ; why do it persist ? why do everyone just accept that this be the way thing be in qatar ? it just boggle my mind that management at all the major shopping center fell no compulsion to offer clean and sanitary toilet to patron ; or that the municipality do n't enforce any cleanliness standard . i just do n't know how people can live like that .

 you should call the traffic police and inform them about the accident to enable them to see the accident ( but dont block the road if it be a minor accident ) or both of the vehicle should be take to the near traffic departmen . in this case both party should agree who be responsible for the accident .
 1 ) call 999 if you be on the accident spot ! 2 ) in case the accident be minor and fault be accept by either one ; then you both may directly go to the near police station and you will get the report instantly . if third party be not involve in the accident & you damage the car by yourself ; you can follow the same procedure # 2 above .
 police report what be the process for get police report for accident ?
 you go to police station ; bring your document and get a police report . possible you need to take a number ? but that 's the procedure .
 this be what happened.. on the 26th of january this guy be in a reverse and he hit me.. he admit his fault and tell me whatever the damage he would pay.. i think that police report be not need because we both agree but i be wrong.. do i still need the detail of his land cruiser ? he give me his number and he be such a nice guy he would stick by his word but the service center say they wont fix a thing without a police report ? i need the location and office timing please .
 i think you need to go to the police station locate in the area of the accident . talk to the guy who hit your car ; and agree on a time for meeting at the police station.i think both of you should be present at the station . explain the situation ; you may need to pay a fee for paper work ; and they may call you the following day for the report . take your id ; id copy ; istimara ; and insurance document with you . make sure that you clear any of your early radar fine ; to get the report .
 call that guy ( who hit your car ) ; and tell him that you will meet in the police traffic division- the near police traffic division be the accident take place ; to whatever time you be both two comfortable of ; since the traffic division be 24hrs ; except i think there be no office during friday and saturday.. and if a you say the guy be the culprit then he should pay 100 plus 20qr for the report ; and you a the victim will also pay 20qr for the report.. after that check with your arabic friend who can read and interpret the report ( since the report be type in arabic ) ; ask them what be the name of the insurer of the car who hit you ; and google their contact nos ; lastly go directly to their office ( insurer ) and give them the police report.. and the they will give you the detail on what you will do next.. i hope that help ...
 thank you you all be very much helpful.. .. thanks !

 they will stamp your passport once your rp be revoke .
 the stamp on ur passeport wo n't affect ur chance in recruitement elsewhere than in doha . if ur leave doha to dubai ; no problem at all if they stamp it . good luck .
 now day anywhere in gcc ( including dubai ) do not allow duel residency ( work visa ) so you must cancel your visa from here ( qatar ) ; otherwise you have to stay in your home country morethan 6 month ( automatically cancell your visa ) you may stay 6months or more on visit visa in dubai .
 you must get your qatari rp revoke if you want to take up a job in dubai . you ca n't have rp in two gcc country . all the best
 i mean cancel the visa after i leave qatar . there be no cancellation stamp in the passport but the company will cancel once i leave . will it create any problem if i get in to dubai with work permit .
 it be necessary to get your visa cancel and cancellation stamp on your passport . this cancel page be a requirement for make a new work visa ; if you still want to work in the gcc .
 mr.nofal ; visa ca n't cancell while you be out of qatar ; either it you stay more than six month or your visa expire while you be out ... i hope you get my point
 ya ms sabeera i get you ; but they have cancel visa after the candidate leave the country ; they say that fill the cancellation form and handing over to immigration department the cancellation can be do . they say they be wait for the emir to sign so when he come and sign the cancellation will be do and they say they would send a copy of cancellation be do .
 i doubt the emir have anything to do with cancelling of visa ; unless you be work directly for him ... . he have plenty of lacky 's do his leg work .
 i be sorry ; it mudhir not emir . i reconfirm this with my bos 2 to 3 time ; i say if i don get my cancellation i would come back to cancel ; he say it would be do in 3 day time after i leave .
 cancellation hi all ; my company be give me only exit permit and say it would cancel my visa after i exit ; be it possible . more over i have get a job offer from dubai who want my visa to be cancel ; be it necessary to have cancellation stamp in the passport or it be ok to cancel via system . kindly reply .

 the below leave be subject to your company 's policy sick leave - 14 day with pay extended sick leave - 28 day with half pay 2 month maternity leave 30 day annual leave 1 day - national sports day eid 1 : 3-7 day ( subject to company 's discretion ) eid 2 : 3-5 day ( subject to company 's discretion ) 1 day - qatar independence day
 in my offer letter they have mention that i shall be grant 20 working day per annum ; which may be avail after probation period in 2 interval . is it like ; i can only take 10 day leave every single interval ? what if i want to extend the leaf ? is there any law or rule that be specifc to my question.. thanks ;
 thanks for your reply.. i be not sure but i hear that employer keep last one month salary ; if we wish to go to our country on vacation . is it true ? thanks ;
 i hope not ; that would be illegal . mandi
 sick leave ; publicholidays a per qlabourlaw how many be the sick leaf and public holidays a per qatari labour law ? in my offer letter ; company have mention that - 'i shall be entitle for sick leave day a per qatari labour law ' and 'i shall be entitle for public holiday a per qatari labour law ' what be all the public holiday and when in qatar ? please help.. thaks in anticipation . thanks ;

 completely forget about the sport day holiday ... . since this year be the first time it be grant ; -p compared to south africa ; there be hardly any public holidays in this country ... . there ; i think we have about 17/18 day a year ; over and above annual leave and sick leave ...
 in my offer letter they have mention that i will be eligible for 20 day pay annual leave after my probation and in 2 interval . is this normal ? i mean 20 day pay leave be fine ? or shall i ask for more ? please advice..

 best spot for catch crab ? does anyone know of any good location to go crab ? the only place i know where people go crab hunting be at simaisma ( crabs not as abundant a before ) .
 you could probably catch crab in the watering hole in the sheraton .
 my friend catch crab at wakra sealine area . however ; i 've see their catch ; it 's small crab but good in volume .
 go to fish market near salwa road
 simpleej ; in your country ; i catch crab at the glass house . once in itaewon ; once at t street in pusan and once at chagal madong in taegu . oh yeah ; several time in dongduchon and ouijangbu . you can keep th seafood !
 go semisima mate ; but make sure there be no moon light otherwise there will be no crabs.. good luck
 drive safe your family be wait for you .
 i 'd guess a with most country you can drive them on private land ( with the owner 's permission ) . if you want to use it along salwa road and have a death wish - feel free ! at the end of the day ; we all see people on quad bike with inadequate light and no protection on the road here at time ; so why not a mini bike ? whether you get away with it will depend on your nationality ! i trust you take out life and third party insurance before you start ! mini bike on public road in the uk set a bad example for the `` real '' motorcyclist so it wo n't be any different here . your call ...
 ow.. but.. i only play at large field near the road.. i know it not allow to ride in main road.. but.. can i ride in field ?
 i believe it would dammage your lamda sensor
 look in you car 's user manual . it will tell you there what ( minimum ) octane to put in it .
 super fuel in place of premium i be put super fuel in my car ( civic 2004 ) in place of premium . what effect it will have on it ? any improvement in pick up ; mileage ; performance ?
 hi nothing will happen my friend believe me it happen to me so many time but now my friend keep it till the red light mark in ur car then return back to premium good luck
 it will increase the life of engine
 a high octane rating do not have any effect on car with a normal compression rating . high performance cars get usually a high compression rating and therefore have to withstand knocking ( detonation )
 just use 95 or 97 octane ... others will harm the engine ... also check your manufacturer 's manual ...
 when roommate borrow your underwear ... & return it back next day .
 you wo n't have a privacy - when you need it .
 painful ; when you share a room in doha jadeed : o ( anyway ; to the op.. do your homework and make sure you can put up with each other.. good luck !
 when roommate borrow your underwear & return it back next day ; remember : `` yellow '' in the front and `` brown '' in the back
 i understand ; it bring some monetary benefit among others .. but how the location have any relation with painful event if any ?
 in that case .. use your roomate 's 'tide ' & wash it alongwith his pillow cover before gift it back to roommate permanently ..
 any good/bad experience with roommate ? i be think of get a roommate but i be new ; so it 's a bit hard to find someone reliable . any good/bad experience ? ?
 do n't do it ! ! ! ! ! if you find a westerner like yourself maybe . or if you know and like the person before you move in together ; that could be cool . i live with someone from a different culture and when it be just u within the four wall of a fairly spacious apartment ; it be like each individual culture be fight for domination with no middle ground . that do n't make for the laid back ; bohemian ; respectful atmosphere i have hop for . i say do n't do it ! ! !
 if it be to save some money ... doesnt matter..however you can define the ground rule in the begin itself with the notice period for kick out option ... : ) if it be for the sake of company ... do n't do it . p.s . : above option applicable for male roommate only ... : )
 i wish i could change here for another one ; ; she drive me up the wall ; ; ; ; i cant stand her
 my room mate be go ; now i think will i get the new room mate same like him ; he be a good human be offcource .
 make sure you find someone that have the same idea a you . i would suggest go out and relax over dinner and chatting . my housemate and i get on well . i find her through a friend of mine . she be the same nationality a me . she work for qatar airways in a management position ; so she travel alot ... which be a bonus a we both get our space . you must have the same or similar out look to life ... or you will be butt head constantly .
 besides share lungi ; try to act busy and unavailable when cleaning and tidy up have to be do in the room but right on time when free food or sweet be to be share ; excuse and regular delay when his part of the rent be due ; have bad story and gossip about others but never himself and the list just go on and on ...
 when they 're yell a youre sleeoinggggg ! !
 lucky you lp !
 is that a `` beautiful room '' mate ? or beautiful `` room mate '' ?
 city center ; i be think of 5k but not sure ; i have a post about it if you be interested
 any good/bad experience with roommate ? i be think of get a roommate but i be new ; so it 's a bit hard to find someone reliable . any good/bad experience ? ?
 can i kick him/her out ? i feel like i be obligate to have a long term contract or something ; otherwise the person would be in trouble . i do n't want him/her to face a situation to find another apt urgently in the middle of the year ...
 so you good re-schedule ...
 you should have use priority service ( 3 day ) wait for 2 week minimum
 i apply last sept 30 and still wait for my visa .
 it take me 3-4 day . apply on sunday and by wednesday you get a message to collect the passport . it sometime take time to get an appointment but since you 've already do that and if your detail be fine it should be 3-4 day
 i suppose it also depend on nationality . mine take two working day . and surprise of surprise ; my sponsor go and it take him a month and also an interview .
 it will take 10-15 working day .
 so what exactly be u try to tell u ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
 come on guy ; i think u didnt get the question . my passport be almost full ; it have visa/perments from different country ; and now i be leave with only 3 empty page . when i be in kuwait they use 3-4 page on the work/residence perment ; therefore i want to know would these empty page be enough for the wp/rp for qatar . if this be bit difficult to understand for you fly bird tell me so i can make more simple .
 one page be more than enough
 passport pages hi all ; i want to know how many empty page be require for the work/residence perment for qatar . i have only 3 page leave on my passport . also for the pakistani here can you tell can i apply fro mrp here in doha ? cheer
 my husband 's employer require six empty page in his passport a a condition of his arrival . i do n't think they use all of them though . mandi
 why do n't you renew your passport ?
 i be in norway right now and would be come to qatar in few day . i dont have time to renew my passport in norway that y i want to know this information .
 you can just add page to your passport . mandi
 my employer tell i need to have atleast 4 empty page . so i guess 4 pages . good luck

 it can work but the danger be to re-gain the weight once you go back to your normal diet . if you just want to loose a few kilo to get inside a dress why not ( but our body do not like very much this kind of game : - ) . for a healthy diet ; change your way of eating by take out the extra ( extra quantity ; extra sugar and fat ) and add the good one ( fruit ; vegetable and exercise ) . you may not loose weight a quickly but it will last . check your bmi kg/m2 ( body mass index ) ; decide what bmi you want to reach ( to be healthy and/or to fell good ) and allow you some time to reach it . http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/body and whatever you do ( diet ; exercise ) ; you have to enjoy it ; if not one day or another you will swap to your old habit : - )
 do n't replace your meal with special k. it be high in sugar and be make from simple white flour . if you insist on eat cereal instead of a normal meal then try eat one that reduce it sugar slowly . i.e . le refined and more complex carbohydrate . dorset muesli for example with nut and unprocesses grain . with the simple carbs in special k you will just get an insulin spike and feel hungry soon after . generally if you want to lose weight then reduce your carbohydrate and increase green vegetable . so less potato ; rice ; pasta and as much green vegetation a you can manage .

 can unmarried girl work in qatar ? hi.. i have come to qatar in visit visa.and i like to work in qatar.but i hear that girl with visit visa cant seek job here.i would like to know be it possible for me to work here under these limitations..if no ; can u suggest any alternative ?
 yes ; you can and they can ... qatar do n't ban single woman from work . the issue would be not with your gender but with your visa . since you 're on the visit visa you need to find job/company that will provide with the residence permit before your current visa expires or else a fine of 200qr/day for overstay . good luck !
 yes u can ;
 surely ummarried girl can work but the fact be that since ur visa be visit visa u have 2 first chng ur visa status 2 a firm then only u cn work becaus emost of the firm prefer female with family sponsorship ie husband/father status .
 it be good for grow child but depend how and when it be consume ... recomendations a ) early b/fast b ) early dinners better to consume with more olive oil ( organic/extra virgin ; first cold press ) a a top add on . two/three time a week be ok if your staple food be not lentil base . i assume you will be buy it from famous hamous guy ( beruit ) ; order it without oil and use your own olive oil a recomended above . hope this help
 please read the second posting

 eid al-adha days off ? it 's my first year in doha and i 'm not sure what day we get off for eid al-adha . can anybody tell me which day this year ; private sector worker ; get off for eid ? i want to get away for the long weekend but i ca n't book flight until i know for certain . thanks ;
 that ca n't be right . i think private sector worker only get three work day off .
 u can fly out 23rd night becoz 24 will be arafat it should be off.u have to be ready for work on 4 th of november . ( government employee ) private sector wil get only three work day off.i guess
 what be arafat ? to be clear . it 's my first year here and i work in the public sector . i need to know what day i get off . i have hear it be three work day . please can somebody confirm the date .
 some people wo n't get any day off ( worker in shop ; domestic worker ; taxi driver etc ) . some people will get 1 or 2 day off . some people will get 10 day off . it just depend who you be and whether your manager like you . there be no hard and fast rule about who will definitely get a certain number of day off .
 i agree that be the case in reality . however ; qatari labour law ( law 14 ) do make specific provision for eid al-adha holiday . for private sector work it state that you should get 3 work day off . if your manager insist on you work those day ; then you be entitle to 150 % of your salary for those day . i do n't want to resight labour law ; a these law be not always adhere to . i just want to know which 3 day this will be this year if your manager just so happen to be a really nice guy and give you the day off a per the 3 day requirement .
 depending on school requirement ; skill ; subject ; ; ; ; and how your be your luck ...
 i think it deal about you & school staff if private school .

 hhhaaa ... buddy ; do n't u remember our school day ? ? ? we all be somewhat same like ur kids..not want to wake up early after spend long vacation ... or always use to give lame excuse to the parent ... wow ; what a wonderful those days were ? ? just be calm friend..they r kid after all..they will adjust soon..try to make them understand with ur love and not by yell on them..it may give opposite result..it do happen with we adult as well coz of the wintery feel in doha from december to february-march..we too feel lazy to wake up for our office sometimes ... so be chill ...
 soniya ; you do n't understand my post . i do n't take the vacation a i take just a couple of month before in summer . its not due to long vacation but due to fall temperature kid be reluctant to wake up . hence i feel vacation should not be disturb to facilitate parent or teacher . do you justify take vacation in advance ?
 are vacation mean for kid or parents/teach many indian school here take winter vacation before actual winter start to join eid with christmas . they start vacation from eid instead of christmas to help parent of all enjoy eid and christmas . but my kid now find it very difficult to wake up for school . they simply hate go to school . what be your comment ?
 `` but my kid now find it very difficult to wake up for school . ''
 blablabla ; i have write that coz of this utter cold temperature kid r bit reluctant to wake up..kindly read my post again..its not even with the child but it happen to adults a well..we feel bit lethargic during winter..so it natural ; the kid will feel same.. my daughter be still small to go for school..but i can understand ur problem..noone can force school to go a per one 's own wish..school authority r fully responsible towards their children..so evenif i want to justify my stand on vacation ; it not gon na to sort out the problem..
 blablabla do they get 8 hour of sleep at night ?
 and there be no logic in blablablas argument . you make the kid sleep at 9 or 10. and if they get up at 5 ; they get 7-8 hour sleep ; which be not bad . is it the kid find it difficult to get up or the parent who get up early to make kid ready ? ... lol

 it easy just bring your paper to the phil embassy include the paper from ched . lagyan lang nila ng stamp . you have to pay them per page .
 same here ; my educ cert be really require for the processing of the work visa . got my cert attest by the phil embassy and after by mofa here in doha . but the p.e . can only accept it for attestation if it have red ribbon from dfa and the dfa authentication require educational cert to be attest by ched . long process but it 's a must requirement . ; d might it help to ask your company again whether it ok to do the attestation in phil embasssy and mofa in dubai ? or a what mention above ; try to inquire p.e . in dubai . if so ; would they need the orig copy ? because it 's kinda a risky to send it via courier unless you personally hand it over to your company.. ? hope this help .
 be careful.. do not ever surrender the original red ribboned education certificate stamp by phil embassy & mofa -qatar ... you be require to submit a copy only ... make sure you have also copy the stamp from phil embassy & mofa-qatar ... the labor dept of qatar do not require the original ... you will only have to show them the original but they will not take it from you ... keep the original with you ... the red ribboned educ certificate have no expiration contrary to what other filipino say ... remember it 's not that easy to get authenticated document ... moreover ; you will also need authenticated nbi clearance ( red ribboned & stamp by phil embassy & mofa-qatar ) .. this time you can surrender the original a the nbi clearance itself be valid only for 1 year ...

 hi alison i advice to you to have a villa in any compaund because your baby will find more kid to play with them and spesialy there he will find a new frinds . thanks and regard
 is doha a good place for toddler ? hi ; we be think about leave our uk home to live in doha . we have a little boy who will be two in january and we be wonder if it be a good place for toddler . are there any group and play area etc . also what kind of accomodation should we consider ? what be the benefit of living in an apartment block to living in a villa or compound . any information would be greatly appreciate . many thanks !
 doha have plenty of play groups . live in a villa ; more kid to play with .
 yeah ! agree with ukengqatar . doha have plenty of play group ... they be call `` majlis ''
 well ; a of our experience ; doha be the worst place for todds and kid . first of all ; there be n't many playground only couple but they be always so crowded and the kid be so agressive you do n't even want your kid to go near them ; the kid here have no respect and no manner ; beside it get super hot in summer so even forget about the park . for sure it good to live in a villa . i would not recommend live here unless you make some good money to save for your future .
 thanks guy . also ; any particular area/ compound we should live in ?
 hi alison ; i have recently move to doha from the uk with a toddler in tow too . my son be go to be 2 in december so theyre roughly the same age . there be plenty of mother & toddler group and nursery to choose from . eventually ; youll make friend with little people and be able to socialise with them more often so the child can play together . speaking from my own experience ; my son be extremely happy here . he love the good weather and he enjoy go swim everyday too . the heat isnt really an issue ; i think the air con be bad to be honest ; i 'm always cold indoors ! i keep my son out of the midday sun and weve be ok so far ( touch wood ) . my hubby be home by 4pm ish everyday ; so quality of family life be much well here than the uk . my hubby and son enjoy spending time together here ; which wasnt so easily do in the uk . im currently live in an apartment ; because hubby company have pay for it for 3 month ; but be look for a villa to move into . i agree with the others ; a villa in a compound be probably the good option . anyway ; best of luck whatever you decide ; feel free to ask any question .
 my advice be first try to convince the employer to process your visa as soon a possible . late sallary do not matter . also inform the employer that you be illegal resident now and will be problem if any emergeny exit require . also inform the employer with very soft word that if action not take then you will be leave with no option but to consult labor department .

 iphone ; n97 or blackberry ? which 1 wud u choose ?
 i will go for n97..all the above 3 be good phone but iphone and blackberry be usless in qatar ... iphone still not launch officialy cant get the 3g setting to work . blackberry avilable through qtel but expensive ... ... most of them u see be unlocked one which be only good to show off and cant be put to good use . aana free ; jaana free ; pakde gaye tho khana free .
 i have try them all ... blackberry be the best.. lot of service and feature ... however ; it kind of a business fon more than any other
 iphone/n97/bb from the above n97 stand out because of it 5mp camera and hd video record . from the above phone anybody can send email and access the internet unless one want to use the company .net.qa email from qtel which bb have . but i think samsung omnia be the best out there a it gps with garmin software stand ahead . it also have 5mp camera combine with advantage of windows . check it out here : http : //www.gsmarena.com/samsung
 ... no doubt.. it not mere cell phone ...
 i have iphone 3g.. with the 3g enabled.. work perfectly .
 if u want for style and look go for iphone ... ... nothing come near ... ..but there be few option miss in iphone ; which other phone have normally ... . dev ; everything desirable ; is either expensive ; banned ; illogical or seeing ( married to ) someone else ... ... ; - )
 blackberry be the best for play brick . any challenger for my high score ?
 n97 is the best mobile in my opinion
 i have 3 of them even the htc touch . nokia n 97 problem with stuck . black barry bold with screen problem i like iphone more then other ; coz of games and can be use for internt browsing and even for using as mp3 . do n't make me angry !
 iphone is good ..but u ca n't make vidoe call..
 kaplan university degree ( online ) is an online degree from an accredit university ( kaplan usa ) acceptable for verification by qatar education certifications ?
 why do you say that online degree be worthless ?
 not for a professional position in education . mandi
 one have to go through a recognised university and not a 'virtual ' university ... ... .. distance learning be the way forward for professional who have to work as well a learn ... ..i have choose a well know uk uni to do mine and it be recognise ! !
 really blosted ? says who ?
 thanks blosted . i do not know ; now i do . but this mentality be wrong ; do n't you think ?
 @ palancole ; yeah i completely agree ; i be even consider get into a online university . but well ; it 's still a big ol'fashion stone age think here .
 i be also consider completely online degree from an accredited uni . it be much more convenient than the traditional distance learn . does anyone know an accredited ; affordable university ?
 geeldorn try a uk uni like manchester metropolitan . google the list of top 50 unis in uk and go on their website and see if they do online degree . but like blosted say ; the mentality in the middle east play against online degree . so just ensure it will be accept .

 thanks ; but how to connect the dlink router in laptop ? i try before to use cable wire i connect it to laptop and to the router of dlink but still i can not log into this ip add .
 hope you have to configure your lan adapter ip address..can u just tell your d-link router model .
 my dlink model be d-link airplus xtreme g dwl-2100ap wireless access point .

 do i need still to connect the cable wire in the router or no need ? can i do it direct here in my pc without use cable wire ? or i will do what you say from the start ? thanks ...
 if u need to configure you have to connect with straight cable to pc/lap.else if d-link be connect with your network type 192.168.0.1 in address bar.else the 1 st one be the only way to do ... .
 i be connect both but this qtel be locate on the ground floor so the signal be not good enough . we put extra router on the second floor .
 it mean you be connect to qtel router use wi-fi and not lan cable . am i correct ? to setup dlink wap ; you have to connect your laptop to dlink wap use a lan cable a azarajez say . but you have to check you router ip addy first ; because usually wap be automatically obtain ip addy from router ( default ) so ; the ip addy of dlink wap change .
 so here it is..ur use dlink usb dwa 125 rite.this be not a router ; an wireless adapter to be use within lap/desk to connect to wireless networks . the thing u have to use be wifi repeater/bridge to extend wireless signal from ground floor to 1st floor..hope you get the answer ...
 i be connect use the dlink adapter
 the thing you have to do to secure your wi-fi be to connect to q-tel router an set password maybe wep/wpa/wpa2.hope wpa2 be more secure..
 please download the manual to configure the ap ... http : //www.mediafire.com/ ? x66nr17n73nhvds

 i 'm also search for dickies here . i like their jean . good fit for me.. : d
 they should find another name ; then they might have a chance here !
 @ barwa village - mustafawi
 inquiry does anybody know any dickies store here in doha ?
 mozais ; when he saw d he think that it be about drive license .
 in barwa village
 there be dickies in mustafawi stores in barwa village ( al wakra ) ; al sadd and city center .
 this be a trickie one..
 i think be behind time ; maybe in sri lanka dickies store also offer drive licence .
 thanks everyone for the tip . i 'll go search for it on the place you have mention here . i need to buy some trouser . : )
 i think you want to sell your dicky ; that be defintley illegal ... ...
 `` sigh '' ... it be so true that humor do not travel well ; sometimes i confuse well write english with the ability to understand english humor . sorry mr dickies .
 have you ask the one who assess you about your drive skill and where have you fail ? because by ask ; you might improve and eradicate those mistake the next time you would go for a license . when drive always see to it that your eye be look on the road and must not look on the shift gear when you change shift . because a split second can endanger someone 's life or your life . slow move vehicle must always use the right lane . when go for an intersection maybe let other car pass before you continue . i forget the right of way on whether you should go or stop . i think it 's good for the latter so that you can have a safe trip . also maintain a considerable distance if there 's a car in front of you . the distance would be the same a if you would imagine that there 's an equal size car in between the two of you . just in case the front car would go and hit his break ; you would have the ability not to hit the front car with the distance you just impose . hope you would pass next time and kindly tell the one sit beside you on your next test to tell your mistake after the result have be give .
 i 'll join in : my wash machine have state to leak ... ... should i buy a new watch ; sail to antartica or ask how much be that doggy in the window ? ps no ! i have n't be to cuba ; stop asking !

 hi ; look if you want to go to egypt by car you need to do triptek from here since your car have a qatari plate number . i go to lebanon twice ; first i go without a triptek but it be a lot of headache especially at syria border ; since i need to pay twice on the border . one when i enter and pas to lebanon and another time when i leave lebanon come back to qatar through syria border . i advise you to do a triptek but you need a qatari guy to sponsor you ... enjoy your trip : )
 hi friend hope u will have a safe trip to egypt . yes ; u need to get a trip ticket book from qatar rive club in c ring road with a qatari sponsorship . for ur car be still under installment ; no problem to leave qatar but do n't ask the bank to give u a letter to leave qatar with ur car . also ; u must have a valid qatari license and u must make car insurance in the saudi border and it will cost u 75/00 saudi riyal per trip . u have two way to reach egypt . 1a- thru deba to hurghada by a high speed fairy boat and the trip will last for 4 hour approx . 1b- thru deba to safaga and it will take about 12hours and i dont prefer it . 2- thru jordan from al aqaba to sharm el sheikh and the trip will take about 6 hours by sea . i hope that the above information be useful to u and it will help u to take the right direction .
 so i cant get triptic from egyption border ? ? ? ? this be too sad coz i dont know any qatari man over here ! ! ! but be it the only way ? ? ? ? ? ?
 can i drive to egypt without have triptec from qatar ? ? ? ? i want to drive my car to egypt this summer ; but every time i ask ; i get ( you must get triptic from qatar car club ) or something like that . and it need qatarian sponsor . is there any way to go there by car without this qatarian sponsor for the triptic ? ? ? the car be instal on commercial bank . do i need any thing more than saudi transit visa ? ? ? please help

 hi leaders23 impressive to read that you have do this journey twice ; would it be possible for you to share your experience ( short trip report ) with u ? thanks mandm
 i read this thread while research the triptic requirement for my drive from doha to london . now that i be back in london i think i can dispel some of the myth . i drive from doha through saudi ; jordan ; syria ; turkey ; greece ; italy ; germany and holland before take a ferry to the uk . the car have a qatari number plate . saudi first ; you do not need a triptic ; just a visa ( transit in my case ) which be usually valid for 3 day . there be nowhere to buy a triptic anywhere near the jordan border . jordan ; there be no need for a triptic or advance visa . this can be buy at the border along with car insurance . syria ; there be no need for a triptic . i have a visa from the syrian embassy in doha . insurance can be buy at the border . turkey ; there be no need for a triptic . visa can be buy at the border along with car insurance . greece ; no triptic requirement ; insurance can be buy at the border and cover the whole eu for one month . having enter the eu ; there be no further visa ; insurance or triptic requirement . egypt have a triptic requirement but be a nightmare to drive in . i would recommend leave the car in aqaba and take the ferry to nuweiba ; where coach operate to cairo .

 aptech ... i think they r the best

 aptech be a fine choice for introductory photoshop lesson .
 if you have never work on photoshop before ; the best would be to first get ur hand dirty with online tutorial and get yourself familiar with the menu 's and just the basic working of the software . youtube be the best source . problem with go for short course be that they just skim through everything quickly give u an introduction ; show you what the menu do and other such option nothing useful..all of which you can learn online for free . once you feel you be good with the basic just enroll yourself for more advanced course where you will fully unleash the power of photoshop ... thats just my opinion for value for money . : p
 souq faleh be the abaya souq . it be on the same road a souq jaber ; it be closer to the western union . there be about 100 shop in there or more ; and you can get readymade or pick a design and they will sticth it for you . you can get a modest abaya for around qr 150 and a more elaborate stich for around 300-400 . abayas in this souq can go for thousand but it depend on how elaborate you want it . bargain the price ; be relentless ; if you dont suceed in one shop go to the next .  `` diplomacy be the art of say 'nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - will rogers ''
 souq al.deera be right next to souq aljaber.. you 'll love love love their abayas.. they 're cheap and they get them make for you in no time.. i just get 4 abays last week . [ img : - ) |link=none|align=left|width=440|height=56 ]

 hi the cheap place to buy a abaya be in souq wagaf
 i only pay 100qr for one that i buy in souq waqif .

 try in family food center along airport road ... .
 try also ; luluhyphermarket ( matar qadeem and gharafa )
 this may be a stupid question ; but i would like to know ; how do we distinguish organic and inorganic fruit and vegetable .
 every where..
 pep24 thanks for your kind information .
 try family food centre
 family food center
 suggest a place for a family get together.. hello ; please suggest few place where i can conduct a family get together for approx . 30 people . thanks --
 if you would like to visit a see line ocean it amaze try to go over there .
 well ; it depend upon your budget . you could try asian ( locate opposite airport ; besides pizza hut ) . they have a big hall that can certainly allocate 30 people easily . or else ; try osra ( mannai-roundabout ) ; they too have a hall you can throw a party . if ur budget be big ; then i think u can rent out taj resoi at marriot .
 money be not an issue.. i need a grand one ... where we can conduct some game & all.. taj rasoi.. can it accomodate 30 ppl ? ? ?
 if money be not an issue then try alishan ; hediard and bateel . there be a great lebanese restaurant in the pearl ( burj al hamam ) but very expensive . you should also try the sanjiv kapoor 's restaurant in souq waqif .
 gud answer cherukkan.. alishan be really pricey..if he do n't have ne pblm ; it would be gud for him to throw a party.. for rest ; i ca n't give much opinion ...
 it be for real
 yest be true . we normally have to apply a week in advance for an exit visa . btw they be not allow to refuse you an exit visa ( supposedly ! )
 for everything you need sponsor letter/approval ... ups you can go to the wc without asking.. or to make sure you dont run away from your job or bank loan . sponsor have to put up the fee for visa ticket and they want guarantee you stay for the contract period .
 you can have your sponsor issue a yearly exit permit but you may have to pay for it ( few hundred qr )
 well in bahrain and uae they re lucky to live without it ; it disappointing coz i be consider qatar a the next destination ; m not sure anymore
 exit permit ? be it for real ? be it true that a a foreigner ( of any nationality ) residing in qatar you re require an exit permit by your sponsor every time you need to get out of the country even for a week-end get away ! i find it strange and life complicating ? could any one confirm it ? thank you dear reader
 if you be lucky your company may grant you a multi exit visa ; it last for 12 month and cost 100qr
 no reven ; it cost 500qr.i have it .
 yes ! ! ! ! if you be under-sponsorship of your company . for husband sponsor - no need for exit permit .
 every corner of the street there be beauty saloons . unless you start your business with a big group associate or in a 5 star hotel ; success of the business be very doubt . most of the parlor be manage by wife a just a time pas or to keep occupied . think twice
 think thrice about invest your hard earn money ... if you be settle in your home country..just stay there and what for to get hammer to bang your head ... .
 no ; of course not ! you can not get the license in one day ! if that actually happen for you ; then it 's completely unfair to the rest of u who work hard and long to get a license ! you need patience ...
 even in lulu hypermarket there be eye testing..unit in the optical shop .
 most of the optical shop be authorize for eye test ; and when you join a driving school they will arrange learner licence same day . but if you be go for direct test ; it be not so easy .
 thank you so much..
 go in the morning to immigration gate 4 first floor ( committee for look into incomers ' application ) . if possible ; go with a friend who know arabic because the people sit there hardly speak english . then ask them that your application be reject and if they do not give a proper answer ; request them a bit firmly ( but not rudely ) to speak to the manager .

 hi just to clear my question ; my visa stamp on 4months before a secretary ( i be an engineer ) when i ask my pro to change profession ; he say ; it 's possible to do only completion of one year.. is it true ?
 hi ; changing your category of work can be do provide you be receive not less than 7 ; 250qr and you have to certify thru bank salary transfer for the last three month of your salary . at the same time your sponsor must allow you to change your status . at any give time you can apply for this . not to mention you have to prove your education attainment like diploma/certificate and transcript certify by your embassy . hope i help you with this ; good luck and be well
 my question ; be u do an engineer job ; if not how u expect ur sponsor to change ur profession ? my second question ; why people agree to come on such visa if their level be high than that .
 mr.salah i be do my engineering design job from last few month with present company and earn good salary too . previously ; my company offer a job and send to me employment visa and at that time i couldnot realize waht be mentiond in the visa . anyways i thankfull you all for your valuable advices.. if anuthing more please drop down for me ...
 i change the profession on my rp after less than 2 month . so it definitely be doable . of course it may depend on who you work for and how vigorous they be in pursue it . cheers sk

 good salary for a street sweeper . not too good for a nuclear scientist . what do you do ! ! ? ! ? ! ? !
 whats your job ? experience ? you should always negotiate for free accomodation or accomodation allowance and free transport home-office & vice versa or transpo allowance .
 2000qr net . the 200 be for the food..all free transpo etc . will work a a receptionist on a exclusive school for girl .
 if u convert that to philippine peso that would only be around 23 ; 000. will u be happy with that ? qr200 for food for a month ? ? no ! not unless u eat arabic bread everyday ; or u will indulge yourself into force diet . if you have a good experience try bargaining for more . ; p
 what ? just a street sweeper ... ? the job be a receptionist on a exclusive school for girl .
 thank you for that info.. they say it will range to 28-20k php ... i dont know how and what be the cost of living there ; i 'm not into dieting..so i guess 200 be not enough..
 if you be well experience so very bad ask for another 1k . you have to bargain ? ? ? ? ? then leave it . if you need more experienced the take it ? ? ? ? it be an easy job ...
 job be receptionist on a exlusive school for girl . i have a lot of experiences.presently ; i work in engineering firm a a technical support representative.. i use be a call center agent .

 what peso ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? pakistan peso ? ? ? ? what currency be this ? ? ? ? ?
 lol qr 200 for food equates to 1 roti or kabooz ( arabic bread ) for breakfast ; lunch & dinner for 2 per month.. ! did your employer actually tell you that qr 200 be your food allowance ?
 right.. but still the offer be slow ... i will demand for a raise.. we be talk about the riyals ... sorry to confuse you
 yeah exactly ... and not only that there 's a added fee i dont know why ...
 sorry ; philippine peso ... the processing fee really suck ...
 if your visa in doha be visit ; i suggest to take that offer because you will be run out of time ... . if not why don '' t try to other company..just pass your resume or cv ; sure somebody will call you for interview ... good luck ... ... ... .
 everything have equivalent amount ; good ask . by the way the 200 i mention be good for 10days because i'am cook my food at night and sometimes eat at fastfood for lunch.expect more ... direct hiring happen only local ; mean when u be here in qatar only . if from phil all be thru agency . at the end your contract in phil will be lessen when u arrive here . let say 200-500 riyal less .
 you have to spend minimum 500 qar/ month for food
 no ; i be in my country right now ... philippines . i get an agency here which link to cambridge.. so the offer i say be accord to the manpower agency here ... if there be way on how to apply directly ; then i should try and go for it .

 hi all ; my concern question be about if you get the job offer 2 ; 500 qr net per month . the company will cover you the visa fee ; the return ticket fee ; meal ; transportation and accommodation . is it still a low salary ? thank you in advance
 thank you for your information ( it include medical ) i have no idea 'bout living in doha ; it make me confuse a bit . if it be hotel industry ; be that an acceptable salary ? or just compare like street sweeper ; )
 miss havu because of the number of people look for a job here in doha have increase ; chance be that salary packages be be offer low since they know that most applicant come here use tourist/business visa . hope you find a suitable job already = )
 best of luck for your new adventure ...

 first time visa processing be normally do by the employer ( in this case your husband 's sponsor ) . however your husband be your sponsor .
 no need exit permit if your family be under your sponsership only check the validity of their resident permit
 your husband be the qp staff so qp be his sponcer a his family you have the family visa under h ( ur husband ) sponcership.you be free to find job & work here ; free to travel home anytime a you dont need any exit permit all this as long a your husband be work in qp.once he decide to leave his job or country your sponcership automatically stand cancelled & you will have to leave the country as well
 you be under sponsor of your husband ... your husband be under sponsor of qp company ... if the company will cancel the visa of your husband automatic ur visa will be cancel as well a ur son
 if aint wrong ... 15-17.000 qr/year . with this amount you can buy tomorrow one aveo model 2003-2006. after 1 year ; you can sell it with 10-12000 qr ! be smart !
 drac be correct !
 the rent a car monthly may cost between 1500 -2000 depend on the condition of the car ; and if it be fully insured or third party ; there be several car rent company ; all be same ; but you need to check all the term and condition before rent one and special term that be relate to car accident
 lol ! ! you guy have to stop renting car for such long period . almost all the instructor in my college have rent car ; some for even 2 year ... really really dumb . even if you dont know the whereabouts in a new country you are already post a question in a website where you can sell your car . even if your considerng the lose you 'll be face when sell your car ; it still go to be good then just pay the full amount of the car & then just walk away . you 'll atleast get half of the price back .
 still if you want to rent . try call euro dollar . they can give you affordable rent per year plus good service as well . number be 4351397. goodluck !
 i agree with above member . you be good off buy a car than rent and just sell it when you be ready to leave qatar even at a loss you be still save a bunch and protect yourself from those `` special term and condition '' .
 is it true ? hi guy 's ; i be plan to buy a used car . but thre be a roomer go on more than 4 yrs old vehicle sometimes later ; if we re-sell to someone ; the buyer can not change the registration to his nme . people say this rule be already implimented in dubai . now this can be implimented here too very soon . also what be the reiability of computer test for used car performance ? can you name any reliable center in najma or near by area ? thx
 i have not hear such roumer ? a for computer check for the car : most of the place be on salwa road ; one very known one be the german computer check up ... be it the best ... can not realy say
 hi may be wrong news . in uae it be 15 year .
 the best place be the german engine check on salwa road . it be 200qr well spent .
 unheard of ! ! ! absolutely absurd ! ! !
 i think you should complete minimum one year with your first sponsor for transfer your visa to another sponsor .
 i see no problem if your current employer issue noc ; lucky you ; they do n't usually give noc here .
 thanks a lot ; ... i get the same view that of prudence4730 's . i ca n't find anything in the labor law that state i need to complete a year of service with my current employer before change sponsorship . but the glitch be ; the pro of my suppose to be new company say that i need to complete the one year service . can you please help me shed a light on this ?
 the pro be right .
 takes one year to change

 our company be give off the next working day which be sunday dec 20th . regards ! !
 yes we have day off..on friday whole day
 we work 6 day a week ( saturday thru thursday ) therefor our management give u the saturday of .
 for private construction companies..no addl . leave.. but for govt. & semi govt . u will get..
 yes we do have off on sunday ...
 qatari national day be on a friday ; do we give a working day off ? hello ; the qatari national day festival be on a friday ( 18/12/2009 ) . since it be an official holiday a per local regulation ; do we have to give a working day off to worker ( i.e . let them off the follow saturday ) ? please answer only if you know the answer officially not on a guessing basis . thanks .
 i wish we could get 1 day holiday either thursday or sunday ... i hope it sunday : d that be for government and/or semi-government . but for private company who have work on friday ... and work in retail ... i doubt if they will give you off-day ; they will just consider it overtime for you ; or add it to your annual vacation leave .
 the labour law clearly say eid and qatar national day should be work day ; so if the holiday fall on friday this day should carry forward to next working day ; if your company work on saturday it should be saturday ; if friday-saturday off should be sunday ; unfortunately some company be not follow any rule which get any benifits to employee ; you work.. work ... work ... we earn when we feel you dont need simply go.. when you find any good job with good salary can say `` no release '' . sponsorship law should be revise or you dont have any right a a human be ; your life be control by a company or a sponsor ? ? ! ! no freedom of movement .
 inshallah .
 here 's the official website for national day . http : //www.ndqatar.com/english/ there be n't yet any event list ; so be sure to check back a 18th dec. approach .
 our company be give u an off-day on thursday ( 17th dec ; 09 ) and i have hear that several other company will do the same .

 be you a qatari national ? how old be you ? the best advice that one can give you be to fisrtly - think about what it really be that you want to do in life . what be you good at ? if you be unsure ... sometimes it help to see a career advisor . they be test that you can take ; which identify your strength and weakness ; and that can ultimately help you pursue a career in line with your unique talent . if you do n't have anyone you can talk to ; e-mail me more detail about yourself ; and maybe i can direct you a little ; o ) bebeuk @ gmail.com
 a bea say ; do what you be good at.. not even what you would love to do ; but what you be able to do ... if i want to be a singer ; but do n't have a good voice ; my only desire without the talent be not gon na help me ... if i want to be a finance manager ; but i could barely pass the math exam in the school ; my only desire without the talent be not gon na help me.. if i want to be a basketball player ; but i be 1m60cm ; my only desire without be gift be not gon na help me ... chose whatever you like out of what you are good at ...
 do you want to continue study far or want to join some short diploma/ certificate course ? i have suggest you early ; go for some ticketing & computer course in the q/a section ; a it 's in demand . but register your self a a private candidate for further study a well . get at least a bachelor 's degree ... it 's my advice : )

 that would be a 2-3 star hotel . moe ( mall of emirates ) be accessible if you 're go by dubai metro . i would suggest that you stay near deira city ( rather than on that area if you plan to stroll around ) . you 'll have more access to mall like deira city center ; dubai mall ( near tall burj khalifa and the awesome water fountain ) and creek park ( dolphinarium etc ... ) and not really far from the airport ... suggestions that would fit your budget ( that i know ) : deira city center hotel ; city seasons hotel ; ibis deira city center ; novotel hotel .
 recommended hotel or apartment in dubai ? hi ; i plan to go dubai with family ( 2 adult and 1 baby ) for holiday on may . can anyone please recommend a good and reasonable price of hotel or apartment in dubai ? preferably close to emirates mall.. convenience . budget about 200-400qr per night . thank you .
 thank you very much for your suggestion . any other recommend area beside deira ? can i drive in dubai with qatar driving license ?

 err ; i 'd be a little take aback if a man come up to me in a doha starbucks and start a random chat and i 'm a westerner ! you need to go a little easy on that kind of thing here . mandi
 what mandi say ^^ go on google/wiki and read up on middle eastern culture ; or you go to get yourself into trouble . if i be you i 'd try to get involve with one of the local group or go along to one of the bar . groups like the hash house harrier be often a way to meet new people ; talk to baldrick on here .
 lot of place to hang around here be you could randomly sit down and have a chat ... . . desert-an area of land ; usually in very hot climate ; that consist only of sand ; gravel ; or rock with little or no vegetation ; no permanent body of water ; and erratic rainfall . desert-a place or situation that be devoid of some desirable thing or overwhelm by an undesirable thing . . http : //www.qatar-info.com for addl info .
 wow ... youd be take aback if someone start talk to you ? even if ti be something of the sort `` what be you read '' ; `` where be you from '' i 'm not talk about plump down in front of someone and start up a conversation ... it more like if one present itself . like you over hear an accent ... and your like.. hey where be you from ? thats what i mean ... if people in qatar cant handle that ... i guess i have 3 thing in store for me ... a gym ... a book ... and xbox ... though i admit dont have one ; but if i cant be randomly social ... video game seem the way to go ... hahaha ryan
 a lot of guy use to go to the one at ramada signal to meet other guy ... now they go to the beanery . besides ; starbucks be so 2006 . no one go anymore .
 yeah ryan ; get yourself on the good ole hhh ; we 'll soon sort you out . doha be to dubai what amish country be to texas . if you be look for sex on the beach then dubai be for you ( till you get nick ) ; but in small town doha ; strange thing get notice very quickly . < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/photos/b '' title= '' monotone mia by baldrick2dogs ; on flickr '' > < img src= '' http : //farm4.static.flickr.com/3389/3262305312 '' width= '' 240 '' height= '' 97 '' alt= '' monotone mia '' / > < /a >
 starbucks in doha i 'm sure that doha be like dubai in the sense that there be bind to be a ton of starbucks all over the place . my question though.. be which one be the best for socialize ? where i 'm from in texas the starbucks i most frequent there be always a ton of people that you could randomly sit down with and have a chat . is there any place like that here ... other than a bar . ryan
 amish country huh ... well i dont think texas have amish ... and if we do ... they 'd have big truck ... which would completely contradict their religion ... and in that case would no longer be amish . starbucks = 2006 ... . well 2006 be a good year ... well maybe youre right ... i just wikipediad 2006 ... nothing really that eventful pop out ... oh god ... im so last year ... what to do with myself ryan
 obliviously you be not gon na be the first texan here.. you be in the right place.. qatar living be the best place to socialize with like minded people ... be active here..you will get to know people even before come here ... provided you behave good..lol talking to random people in starbucks be not a good idea..lol they might ask ... 'why you wan na know what be read ' ? ?
 see you already find one ... rob7-9..lol
 hey ryan - welcome to doha ! ! ! ! definately a big change from texas . the starbucks thing be definately a bit out of it now . atleast here in doha ... coffee be still rockin ' though so it an in-an-out thing ... columbiano coffee on cring by chili 's be actually pretty decent . i frequently plop myself down outside or on the nice comfy chair and have coffee and a bit of lunch and internet surf ... great in the evening after gym anyway ( al massa be right behind ) or on saturdays . ive strike up a few conversation here and there and run into quite a few expat do the same . good luck brin
 you will do great here . people be reserve ; but i 've find if you smile and say hello ; they will do the same . you may have to initiate the conversation ; but many people will jump in if you start it . trust me ; the endless coffee shop be thrive everywhere ; starbucks ; include . have a great adventure ... it 's what you make it . sybil < img src= '' http : //www.kandjsupplies.com/animations/pics/animal '' / >
 yes a majlis where most qatari 's allow any nationality sit with them chat and drink kaiwa and smoke sheesha ... in my majlis there be westerns ; indians and others sit and chat with each other till 10pm ~posted from the overlord~ ~ and all right reserved~
 i 've be in a tiny rental car since ive be in dubai ... and yesterday my company be like `` we 've get a big truck for you '' the truck they give me be a toyota ... i dont know about you all ... but i dont think toyota know the meaning of big ... nor do my british colleague that i work with . a real truck be the kind in which you need a step latter to get into . hahaha gyms ... . ok ... because ive be work so much i have eat an abundant amount of crap . ie mcdonalds ; burger king ; etc ... i think ive eaten more fast food in the past month than i have in the past 2 year ... anyway ... be there any good gym to work out at there ? by good.. i mean ; im use to a 24 hour fitness type ; in which the gym be huge ... not a hotel fitness room . on a personal note ... i dont have a truck back home ... i have dodge charger ... and if i be to get a truckish type vehicle.. id go for a hummer ... even though they be most likely go out of business ryan
 ryan ; i hear fitness first have already be open at city center . might want to give it a try ! : ) cheers ; austin
 welcome to ad doha ; al rayan !
 texas be a very friendly place ... . 1st thing you notice be here nobody smile except with their friend ... people be not friendly and do not greet stranger with a smile and hi ; how be you ! people in this place have grim face match the dreary desert sand and oppressive heat and rough road hey ; go to industrial area and you will have ton of fun : - ) lol
 starbucks in doha i 'm sure that doha be like dubai in the sense that there be bind to be a ton of starbucks all over the place . my question though.. be which one be the best for socialize ? where i 'm from in texas the starbucks i most frequent there be always a ton of people that you could randomly sit down with and have a chat . is there any place like that here ... other than a bar . ryan
 ryan ; you may notice that a lot of people do n't smile . perhaps you will notice also that lady do n't smile at all . : ) that 's because of cultural difference ; i think . back home we smile to stranger ; but here if a woman smile to a man ; he think you like him and stalk you . arghhhh ... oh ; i know westerner do n't behave that way but unfortunately ; westereners be not the only one populate doha . cheer !
 i do n't know if you have child ryan from texas but if you do and they say please and thank you they will be laugh at here in qatar ! take them to one of the amusement area and see how rude the child be here and how they have no respect for line ( queue ) and no courtesy at all
 whats all this thread about ? ? people not friendly in qatar ? false they do n't smile ? false again they do n't say plz and thank u ? one more false thing they do n't chat ; speak ; or talk to stranger ? hello ! ! !
 play nice : )
 fs i do n't know what ur talk about.. ive live here all my life and ppl always seem to be friendly i have never come across some guy be rude or obnoxious for no reason with me.. there r the occasional moron at the cinema etc.. but in general i think every here be pretty decent n respectful ... < span class= '' inline leave '' > < img class= '' image preview '' src= '' /files/images/coollogo '' alt= '' '' width= '' 237 '' height= '' 58 '' / > < /span >
 loathe a i be to make generalization ; i disagree bahraini . compared to other countries ; people be not a friendly to stranger in qatar . compared to other countries - they smile much less . compared to other countries - people here be obnoxious ; disrespectful to service staff in cafe ; restaurant ; shop ; disrespectful of queue ; non-smoking sign ; use of mobile phone in cinames ; and child here ; particularly arab kid ; be the rude little brat i 've ever see . compared to other countries - no ; they be on the whole not friendly to stranger . try living in a western country and you 'll see the difference . people form orderly queue in traffic ; at the movie ; in shop ; everywhere . they do n't smoke indoors . they say please and thank you .
 bahraini and others that think that this be a `` friendly '' and `` respectable '' place be not on the outside look in ... .

 pm - is ramada signal where the gmc garage be ? and the starbucks be next door to johhny rockets ? ryan - if the answer to the above question be yes ; then i would say this be a good place to start . i be from the uk and everytime we drive past that starbucks it always fairly busy - no jam pack ; but busy enough ; and i always say to my husband `` let stop there for a coffee '' . we have go there a couple of time and although i have only be here just over 2 week ; i think it will be my new hangout . just listen to conversation and you can pick out the english speaker from the none english speaker - although i havent noticed anyone reading book here yet ; which be a shame ... maybe me and you could start a trend ! : ) in our old flat in the uk we use to have a starbucks just a 5 minute walk distance away and i use to go there so regularly that i become pally with the staff and if i wasnt always in a rush ; i would have probably make a few friend as well . i be like you ; i always want to strike up a conversation with randoms because people interest me and i believe that you never know who you be go to meet . at the end of the day ; dont let this thread scare you off meet people - ok ; if they be wear abaya ; perhaps not ; but i have find when you speak to people here ; they be usually very friendly ; more friendly than dubai even ! ( i have never be to texas so ca n't comment on that neck of the wood ! )
 starbucks in doha i 'm sure that doha be like dubai in the sense that there be bind to be a ton of starbucks all over the place . my question though.. be which one be the best for socialize ? where i 'm from in texas the starbucks i most frequent there be always a ton of people that you could randomly sit down with and have a chat . is there any place like that here ... other than a bar . ryan

 maybe you didnt do the right procedure to downgrade ur psp ? ^^
 you should take out the pandora battery first after downgrading your psp . then use the ac adaptor or your original battery for your psp to install the cfw .
 hey ! you dont have to go to souq . i can fix your problem if your use a psp slim . ^
 help ... psp downgrade ... help help ... ... ... ... . i just buy psp slim make in japan with 4.01 firmware . it show psp-2000 model on the hardware . i try to downgrade to be able to play game in memory ; but still have not luck . borrowed pnadora battery from friend ; when i plug it the system never come out . it keep blink the green on battery side . anybody could help to guide or help me to solve the problem ?
 pandora battery + magic memory stick = jailbreak . pandora battery alone will not jailbreak it ... you nead the mms with the custom firmware to load and flash your eeprom .
 unfortunately ; there be n't any available hack for the fw version 4.01 yet . yes ; it 's the same psp 2000 but it 's the new batch sony produce with a different motherboard . so basically we have to wait for the hack to be develop ; same go for the psp-3000 .
 visit visa be limit for month which if you have if family you can stay up to 6 month in a year and if you have work visa you can stay here for 1 year
 main difference be that a visit visa holder can not work whether pay or unpaid . whiles a work visa holder can work and stay here as long a the sponsor wish . he need to renew your resident permit every year pay nominal fee .
 work visa : enables u to work for a company ( private or international ) for a period of 1-3years ( depending on ur company ) in qatar . visit visa : keeps u in the country from a period of 14days-6months ; but not empower for work purpose in qatar .
 visit visa be only limited time maximum of 6 month and legaly a visitor can not work . where a work visa you can work and duration depend for how many year sponser make residency . usually minimum for 1 year and maximum for 5 years .
 visit vs. work visa 1 . 6 month no extension 1 year renewable each year 2. purpose be to visit purpose be to work as simple a that .
 by the way work visa be also call work visit visa these day . so that make all the type of visa 'visit ' visa only ; so which type of visit visa difference you be look .
 change kitchen cabin if it s make of wood and use aluminium cab
 mr arunkumar i will tell you the most effective solution ; a little costlier ; but it ensure nearly one year releif from coockroadches there be a tube ( like some oinment ) name goodby roaches cost around qr.45 . when i do nto get this ; i get it from dubai . 2-3 drop of this liquid ; apply different part of the house..and forget cockroach for one full year . so surprising ... i dont know how it work or wean away the insect
 what type of spray be good for cockroaches we be face problem with cockroaches be good bye roach good for it ; any idea to solve this permanently

 agency for private cleaning service ? where can i find an agency that have cleaning service for private home ? anybody know ?
 engaging a carpet cleaning service could become mandatory if you have carpet at home . considering they be always expose to the outdoor environment ; accumulation of dust and grime be a common affair . for the first few month ; vacuum cleaning will solve the problem .
 hiya ; some advice . make sure that you hire local carpet cleaning companies ; for 2 reasons..firstly ; economics ... the money spend on a local company mean that the monies will be re-distributed local . the second be the reputation of the cleaning company ... a local firm have to live within your community ; so their reputation be on the line thus ensure that the job will be do to a high standard .  < a href= '' http : //www.arcticcleaning.ie '' > cleaning companies dublin < /a > < a href= '' http : //www.arcticcleaning.ie '' > carpet cleaning dublin < /a > < a href= '' http : //www.arcticcleaning.ie '' > window cleaning dublin < /a >

 i suggest not to open internet cafe ; time and technology be change now . internet cafe time be go ; it time of mobile net . always go for the business which have good future feasibility ; internet cafe business have no future . just in couple of year time mobile net will be more advanced .
 lol.. do u think people will come to nefcafe for the internet these days.. ? ? ? coz it easily available even in mobile ... so u r choice be not correct ; i guess.. choose another business .
 i feel open the internet cafe be not a good option ... .since internet connection be available every where ...
 i be agree with others ... no future in internet cafe bsns ... dont dream about it a people will come there and utilize it ... . just abandon that idea and try to host a new busnss of mobile ; computer ; cosmetic ; restaurant etc like that dont spoil money and time okey
 i agree also ... but incase you think of something again do business you may contact my id here at ql ... and i can give you assist and consult for start new business . thanks !
 opening up an internet cafe be viable only at certain location ... ..well if u have identify one..kewl but to make it more viable you can really add on value add service ... ++ much much more ... my advice ... ... .. do have your feasibility study do ... ... work on minimal operational cost & think smart ... best regards rk email : eximgulf @ gmail.com
 you have'nt mention about your friend ... be they muslim ? i do n't think so any one should have objection on it.. they be not only ur friend they r ur guest too so give them respect .
 kindly dont indulge every matter of life with muslims . why anyone here have objection to stay with you ; if they have visa & other legal formality for qatar . do you still think ... ... ... ... .. ?
 there be no law that prohibit you from entertain a married couple . there be however always the possibility of some narrrow mind person make an objection . this would invariably be a fellow expat who wish to make a statement in an attempt to draw attention to him/herself . 99.9 % safe .

 no ; it a public holiday . so you have get pay for that .
 no way.. dont keep quiet . how can eid holiday be leave without pay ? gift a copy of qatar labour law to your hr department . if they still persist to cut your salary go and see the labour department official ... thy will help you .
 some people go vacation this september ; try to negotiate with the company to extend 3 day from their plan vacation . for example they be suppose to start vacation by sept 10 and comeback by oct. 10 ( 1 month vacation ) and the eid holiday will be from 21-24 ; they usually come back by oct. 13. something like that .
 the worker shall be entitle to annually ; leave with full wage a follow : 1.three work day for eid ei-fitr 2.three work day for eid al-adha 3.one work day for the independence day 4 . three work day to be specify by the employer .
 need expert advice i have an impt question and need expert feedback . if the last day of annual leave be immediately follow by 3 day of eid holiday ; are these 3 day consider a part of annual leave ? in my company the hr dept . calculate the 3 day a extension of annual leave and hence leave without pay . is this correct a per the law ? experts pls guide .
 not all company fall under the labour law troll ; you work in the ministry you should know that . qp ; rasgas ; al jazeera etc and the rest of the government be not govern by the labour law ; they be govern by their own policy with civil law be the deciding factor . if you be on leave during a holiday ; that day be count a your annual leave . if you return from leave and resume work for one day prior to the eid holiday then it will not be count a annual leave . same go for maternity leave . annual leave be pay leave and an public holiday that fall within it be not count a extra day unless your company have specific policy in this regard .  `` diplomacy be the art of say 'nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - will rogers ''

 no need for a travel agent for tour . just book the cheap flight and go directly to sultanamet in istanbul . all the sight be conveniently locate in that area and there be dozen of hotel that you can choose there and then . we just use the map and walk everywhere ! ! ! yeh we didnt need to waste money on taxi or othe transport . let me warn you that mid june and jult get very hot and humid but the monument be certainly worth it . we even walk to the bosporous from our hotel ( hotel ambassador ) and buy the ticket there and then ; for the boat ride so no need to spend extra by buy the ticket from a tour operator . istanbul be beautiful and the kid and i love it . cant wait to go back .
 lamea have give you excellent advise . we have a lovely trip 2 year back . all major attraction be walk distance in sultan ahmet . we spend 3 day in istanbul ; then take a tour from one of the local tour operator and spend 12 day explore cappadokia ; pammukale ; kusa desi ; troy etc . it be great ... we learn a lot about history ; do a lot of trek ; me ; my wife & 3 kid love the tour . the 12 day trip cost me 1000 euro and about 500 in istanbul . call me if u need more info ... cheers zak ( 6646-8056 )
 wow.. thank you everyone . yes ; actually my plan be to travel and explore istanbul by ourself and get a local tour for trip to cappadocia and pamukkale . or be it a good idea to travel to cappadocia and pamukkale without tour guide a well ? ? we will be travel to turkey on end of september . i believe the weather be nice on that month .
 turkey be a mountain country ; so travel by train and coach be slow ... i buy the package from a local tour operator in istanbul ( sultan ahmet area ) . all tour operator give u the same package i.e . the hotel accomo be same ... but the one on the main street be twice expensive compare to the one in side street . we take a luxury coach from istanbul at night and arrive early morning in capadokia ... then take coach to pammukale ( 6hrs ) ... it be comfortable and pleasant ... you can research about turkey on the internet . you dont need a translator ... the tour operator will give u the itinerary for your trip and when u arrive at hotel they tour guide will collect you and they speak good english . when u be in capadokia please take the hot air baloon safari ... it a great experience to see the chimney from above ... leave the kid in the hotel because it expensive . cheers
 e-mail to turkeytripplanner @ gmail.com we be turkish people live in qatar and prepare trip plan a per your request a a guide to you subject to a reasonable fee . i would like to remind that we do n't have any connection with any airway or travel agency in turkey and qatar ... our aim be to prepare a plan so you can enjoy the best of turkey .

 what be the meaning of this trafic fine ? i be fin qr500 for `` owning more than one license from the same class '' . i only have one driving license for my car and have not do any amendment to my drive license . could anybody please explain what the fine mean ?
 it 's a wrong parking ; trust me . i think their system generate reason in english randomly ; without any order . if you can check the arabic version ; you will see what do it mean . and again ; i be pretty sure ; it 's a penalty for the wrong parking . just go and pay it .
 all young poeple should only get their license at 21 ; drive in qatar be quite hectic and you will only just add to horror on the road sorry ... you need hair on your teeth when drive here ... mayb some people will come up with a different view . if you value your life rather use a taxi

 speech delay alone be not a sign of autism . there be other sign . i would highly recommend that you go to shafalllah centre for an assessment ; and if he be diagnose there a autistic or just speech delay ; you can go to qatar autism centre for private one-to-one session ; but this depend on your budget ; rumaila 's problem be that they have very busy schedule and they give you only one session per week and they depend on the parent to continue at home but they be support by hamad so you do not pay a lot for this session . but in qatar autism centre ; it be not support but they can give you up to 3 time a week and during the evening and not during work hour a in rumaila ! good luck !
 thanks all for your support .

 will the paintwork of a uk car be up to the rigour of life in the desert ? i think car for the qatar market have special treatment to protect them from the abrasive sand .
 i be glad you think everything be so easy ; i personally find drive here a bit more difficult than london . i guess i be just thick . seeing a you be find everything so easy ; go to the ministry and ask them if you can do it . that 's what i do .
 i think the question be pretty straight forward . indeed ; i shall make all the necessary inquiry regard the car 's spec ; before make my final decision . however ; at this time ; all i want to know be if it be < b > possible < /b > to do it . a simple < b > yes < /b > or < b > n < /b > o would do . if yes ; then the appropriate measure to do so would be a nice addition . beyond that ; whether i wish to risk < i > my < /i > car 's paint work ; rubber ; plastic ; ac etc will be a decision that i 'll take later . thanks

 first pls do n't eat fry thing to stop the pimple second use medicate soap & keep away from other 's family member third consult a good doctor if you want home base product then contact with me .
 go to the pharmacist and ask about retin-a gel/cream .
 hi ! i have break out a few month back ; no doubt exacerbate by the weather ; dust and food here . before ; i use to have few pimple but it be hormonal ( i only have pimple after college already ) so my ob-gyn prescribe a low dose birth control pill for me ( diane ) . it work actually but since i do n't want to be under medication on anything for a long time ; i stop take the med . i tried lot of over the counter product but not all of them work a advertised . now ; i 'm use st. ive 's facial scrub ( gentle ) ; follow by an exfolliant/ lightening product ( extraderm-a filipino product ) then moisturizer ( olay complete ) . thank fully ; the break out subside . i guess ; you have to use gentle product and stick with them if you be okay with them . ( i have use clearasil before but it be not effective on my skin ) then stay away from fry food esp . chicken and dusty place . i have a major breakout when i be still live in gharaffa which be very ; very dusty . if you want first aid ( when you have to go on date or impt . function ) do these step : 1. clean face 2. put ice on the pimple for about 10-20 min . this will lessen the swelling . 3. dip a piece of cotton on fresh lemon juice then place it atop the pimple for about 5 min . this will lessen the redness . feel free to pm me if you have further questions..
 hi kindly avoid chocolates ; oily food & wash face with normal water . ( not cholrinated ) store water for 1 hour and use it . you feel well and confident in two month of time neethu
 thanks guy ; your advice be take and compliment of the season to you all .
 problem skin please help . i have pimple and spot from pimple ; what can i use ; and be do i get the product ? thanks in advance .
 rein a be effective but first you have to find something to peel the out part of your skin ... this will make any over the counter cream effective . maxi peel be use for at least a month but avoid sun while use ; good yet use only at night ; and lot of moisturizers and sunblock in the day . peeling of the skin be good so a to take out all old skin where dirt hide and and when infection occur ; it freak out there the pimple cause . but after few week of peeling ; you can then proceed to retin- a for complete medication . chocolates or sweet or fry be not really the cause ; but make the pimple big it trigger to be big ; itchy ; red ; and swell . avoid spicy too ; drink citrus juice help to shrink them . if this pimples really big and all over your face and even at your back ; well consult the doctor to take medicine intake ; i forget the name ; but i will get back to you soon i remember
 is retin-a ( tretinoin ) available over the counter in qatar ? it 's also a good anti-wrinkle cream .
 i doubt ... ... .let him try his luck !
 he can apply to another country in gcc if his saudi visa be cancel .
 that be why they call it gcc ; entire region of gulf country . he can apply to any gcc country except saudi with his new passport . otherwise ; noc be a requirement .
 there might be a 6 month period where he be ban in the gcc overall ; but the 2 year be only applicable in the individual gcc country .
 no ban in gcc ; only in ksa . he can still work in any other gcc ; irrespective of the ban in ksa !
 he can apply for other gcc country .
 if he be not blacklist by saudi ; he can apply
 he be not allow 'dual gcc residency ' . if he do n't cancel his saudi visa it will automatically expire 6 month after his departure and then the ban time start . if his visa be cancel by his employer it go straight into ban period ( however long that be in saudi ) . suggestion ? get a new passport to reenter another gcc country . have meet many people during my stay in qatar who have do the same .
 exit ... ... ... ... .gcc ... ... ... .. ! my friend be in saudi arabia for the one year . now under vacation in sri lanka . but he be not interested in go back to saudi due to some problem with employer . i think a per the rule he will be get exit and cant go back to saudi for next two year to work under another employer . can he apply immediately for another gcc country or the saudi exit will effect all gcc country .
 i have a couple of guy in our company who be ban ( not only cancel ) in uae and they get their qatari work visa with the same passport . only in some specific case ; the ban be impose in all the gcc ... not in all . as far a the dual gcc residency be concern ... .. i dont know about all the gcc but qatar allow you to keep both by pay a fee of qr 2000/year . the information be available on the moi 's website .

 ramada sports bar
 thanks luciano ! i must admit ; i do n't make it to the ramada and do ( sadly ) end up in champions . the big problem with champions be the lack of sound a i like hear the commentary . are we able to hear the commentary in ramada ? if not then i guess i will watch it in my hotel room . i wo n't be able to have a beer but i will at least really enjoy the cricket .
 yeah that 's what i 'll do in the short term when in the company 's hotel apartment ( get sky player so can watch most thing live then ) . would rather have all the sport channel when i get my only place
 which hotel ? movenpick towers be too slow to run anything useful . just about get away with tvcatchup but forget iplayer ; 4od ; sky go/player ... need too much bandwidth . : (
 watch england v west indies hey guy be there anywhere ( preferably where i can have a beer ! ) i can watch the england v west indies cricket game ? i be think champions in the marriott but it not actually a very nice bar in my opinion . any other hotel or one of the few licensed bar ? cheers
 i 'll be stay in the asas twin towers apartments in west bay . obviously i 've not idea what they have there ! if the internet be too slow then it 'll have to be the pub for any sport until i sort my own place out when the wife come over at the end of summer .
 ok ; so you should n't be too far from the marriott then which will at the very least ; cover the usual selection of sport . failing that ; you also have the option of the ramada but that 's a bit further out of town ( 5 each way in a cab ) . i personally be not a big fan of champions ( the marriott ) but i will if i have to . also ; a these pub show many different sport they rarely put the sound on ... . although they do for the footy the other night . of course ; another option would be to go sit in champion with your laptop ; stick your headphone ; tag on to the free wifi ; fire up the vpn and order a beer ... ; )
 ok thanks for the advice ! i 'll be look for somewhere decent to go for the euros ; especially the england game . will be over after our first game . once i get my permanent place i 'll sort out my sport base tv package !

 the cheap rate we have the last time we rent a car be for qr60 per day ; honda civic 2005 . go to bin omran ; there 's a corner there after badriya signal with lot of car rental service and i think you can bargain for a low rate if you will rent for a month or more .
 can i get a car ( old or new ) for rental for less than 1000 riyal if any body know about any car less than 1000 riyal for rental ; please answer me .
 you will get for 1000 riyal sure but for 15 day only ? ? ! ! you can rent a two wheeler for 1000 riyal ; before you post such a idiotic question you should know the price of a vehicle and the market . if you can open car rental business for this price i be the one to fully book your vehicle first .
 1000 riyal per day.. sure.. why not ?
 yes ; but you will have to peddle with your foot through the hole in the bottom of the car . a bit like fred flintstone 's car .

 canned food might include many preservative ; additive ; flavor ; coloring . most be not natural product . rather artificial . i be talk about the eeeee 's family . i be not sure if there be any study in this regard . but there be warning about additive . check the ingredient and do some research about the e-family . here be a link to start with http : //www.ukfoodguide.net/enumeric.htm in my opinion . a nice presentation have nothing to do with the way you prepare food . for example salad be usually a cocktail of vegetable ; possibly some fruit ; possibly cheese and ham . you can simply mamage a nice decoration for the top part and forget about the low part . if you watch how jamie oliver prepare the food ; you will be amaze . in no time he can prepare food and arrange a table with a nice variety and it look yummy ===================================== http : //www.qatarliving.com/node/58409

 for the budget they have ; one can send all hmc patient to mayo clinic and still have more money left . jci be a management accreditation ; not quality . hmc dare to publish a survey show how many of their top staff ; or their family ; actually use the service of hmc .
 jci ? what be the significance of have jci accreditation when a hospital can not give proper intervention to even it own working staff ; little less general population ? one qatari tell me . trying to get a proper straight answer from the doctor be like try to catch a chicken blindfold . that be why we go overseas for treatment . i do not find this comment reassure . how would you rate medical service here in qatar ?
 jci be a very good accrediting body which provide correct tool and solution to any healthcare organization . proper or actual use of those tool rest at the hand of the staff . 1 . implementation be such a different issue . that depend on the staff ' intellect ; willingness to adapt new process ; as well a their genuine service ; not to mention that they should have real education ; not fake one .
 jci be direct all department for the right procedure and policies.to be honest if jci be not visit ; there be enough staff just neglect their work . that can be see just before jci visit ; their running everywhere . do n't know what to do.coz they be not working.if we do daily update and follow procedure ccomplete our day-to-day work and responsibility ; we do n't have to scar of jci.what i notice so many department ; head be panic and update everything only just before jci visit . i be really happy to have jci visit every month .

 is the visa upon arrival still stop and if so be this permanent ?
 visa upon arrival be never an option for filipino national . < a title= '' view user profile . '' href= '' /user/bzfshzn '' > bzfshzn < /a > ; if you be american ; you still can obtain a visa at the airport ; whfor qar100 ; valid for 30 day ; and extendable for another 30 day .
 only carry the current passport . get all your active visa from the old passport transfer to the new passport .
 if the visa already in your new passport ; they will never ask for the old one .
 it 's interesting how the answer differ here on ql . do you know now what to do ; felix ? or would n't it be good if you ask the concerned authority ( if you can find out who they be ) ?
 lp i agree with you ; such issue should be ask with the concerned authority otherwise carry both the passport nothing to loose ;
 well if you have a renew passport and your rp be on the old one you have to carry both until it 's time to renew your rp which they stamp it on your new passport ; then you only carry the new one : d

 where can i get international driving license i be have qatari license hi how and where from can i get the international driving license . i be possess the qatari driving license . how quick i can get and how much it cost . i want to use this idl in country of europe ; cananda and usa .
 contact shyam -5812994 ; qr:150/-
 first the international driving license be not a driving license ; just a translation of your dl in several language and should be provide by an official authority not by any web-based agency . second ; this do not replace your dl ; and you have to keep both document with you . third ; the qatar dl be not recognise in many country ; i just check in france and belgium and this be not the case at the moment . so check before for every country you plan to visit ; since in several country you will not be allow to drive . generally speak it seem that it work with reciprocity ; nationality that have to pass the driving test here come from country that do not recognize the qatari driving license . this might chance since it seem that obtain the dl here be get hard .

 state of qatar do n't allow practice of homeopathy ; tough luck .
 that might not be the case flexicode . from what i 've hear there be place here that do provide form of natural/alternative medicine ; which they call here 'ilaaj tabee-ee ' . i know that the boots store in uk stock homeopathic remedy but i 'm not quite sure about the boots here ; but it still worth continue to ask around or when in doubt call up 180 and ask if they have any number for place that practice natural medicine or homeopathy .
 uk ; the practice of homeopathy be prohibit here by law ; but if somebody be practice it under a different name ; i do n't know . however i will be happy to find a good homeopathy practitioner in qatar myself . lets find it and whosoever come across one ; will inform the other . i will be work on your 'ilaaj tabee-ee ' clue . : )
 thanks guy ; well actually ; cant understand why it forbidden in qatar ; i need homeopathic remedy for myself and my allergy ; otherwise i would have to take commercial medicine which be heavy in side effect . homeopathy be just great ; a little plant can make miracle . if you do find out ; please post it on the forum again . thanks -

 sheraton hotel n la cigale
 ritz calton .
 almost all 5-stat and 4-star hotel will have very good christmas cake .
 no clear favourite till now ; i guess.. mercifully ; nobody mention oriental baker and family bakers.. no offence about their cake . they be ok but be look at something that will be remember ( not for the price tag ) ..
 ive taste al bateel ; opera ; and four season ; the best be albateel ... give it a shot ...
 the best cake you will ever get during this season be the one that you make at your house . surely al bateel ; opera ... .. will be good ; but cant be compare to the one serve with love
 i have to add that they provide accommodation . not an allowance .
 what be consider a good package what be consider a good package in qatar ? i be approaced by a company ; they offer 1800usd + housing + relocation + school + transport . is this good ; bad ... .. or just okay ?
 i think it 's small
 that be more or less qar6.5k . i think that 's a bit low ; but if they pay for your accom and school for your kid ( your two big expense ) ; you could be make some saving ... maybe just get them to specify the nature of the perk ; i.e . accom=flat or villa ; transport= ? . also ; do they provide you with return ticket per year for you and your family ? hope this help .
 lol dracula ! ! ! i also think it be a bit low . i 'm now on almost tripple that in my country ; but offcourse not have any ohter benefit . thanks dukes . i will ask them to send me a more detailed breakdown of what they 're offer . but overall ; i think i need to negotiate for a big basic .
 `` what be consider a good package '' euhmm ... . i think above 16 cm be consider a `` good package '' .
 come on people ; i 'm actually quite serious . i do find ( some ) of your comment funny ; but i would like to get a clear/honest answer . please . are there only males on this site ... .. huh ?

 any suggestion of where i can get an answer to my original question ? lol ... ... or if there 's any female out there ( from the same planet ) ; that do understand my question ( which be in clear english ) ; please answer me ! hehehehe . grrrrrr !
 the only way to determine if it 's a decent package be to try and assess your living cost and determine how much you would be able to save . that 's what the majority of people be in qatar for ... .to save . it 's difficult to fix on a salary a there be so many extra ( a others have mention ) such a education allowance for kid ; housing ; transport ; possibly a furnishing grant etc .
 prada ; package be fine in itself ; it combine all major cost ; hence you will be able to set aside little . but you will not be live like a king . if your salary back home be equal ; stay away . if this be a major improvement ... why not .
 thanks for the reply ... . now we 're get somewhere hehe . we 're a family of three . they will also cover schooling ; which be great ; since we have a 2 yr old . i think it 's okay ; since they will cover all major cost . at the moment ; we 're look at save about 2000qar . dh will also have to find a job once we be there . i have request a detailed breakdown of all the extra 's they will be cover ; so i 'm wait to hear back from them . if they cover all major expense ( housing ; school ; transport ; relocation ; medical ) ... 6400qar + dh 's salary be not to bad ( i think ) .
 what be consider a good package what be consider a good package in qatar ? i be approaced by a company ; they offer 1800usd + housing + relocation + school + transport . is this good ; bad ... .. or just okay ?
 prada ; do not come for less than you be make in the us . the standard recruitment package for americans be your current salary plus 25 % overseas benefit plus housing ; transportation ; ticket ; medical and school for up to three child . you 're be low-balled ; honey ; negotiate for more ! you wo n't have the chance later ; believe me . mandi

 in west bay ? or at west bay towers ? you will be look at 7500 qar per month and upwards . however ezdan have cheap accomodation in west bay - 3500 pm on a long term contract .
 thanks azamat . i 'm look for accommodation at any one of the tower in west bay . qr3500 be a pretty good price . what be the tradeoff ?
 it 's a one year contract . i think the 3500 apartment do n't have a kitchen . the one with a kitchen cost almost double . 6500 i think
 the tradeoff ? other than what wirehead mention above - living in ezdan will remind you of prison cell in shawshank redemption . not to mention ; ezdan have the bad fire safety record in qatar .
 studio apartments in west bay towers can anyone tell me the price range of studio apartment in tower in west bay cost ? i 'm go to start work in one of them and would like to live near work if possible .
 without a kitchen ? how be it an apartment without a kitchen ? mandi
 that 's what the guy i talk to say when i ask about the rate in ezdan . probably more like a hotel room instead of an apartment ?
 mandi ; originally ezdan be build a a hotel ; then they re-built it a residential appartements.. i guess they leave few small appartments without the kitchen a a hotel room.. the layout of the flat suck ( some flat build in a way that you have to cross the bedroom to get into the kitchen ) ; quality suck ; and it 's already feels old and stinky ... since they rent out some apartment for the short term like a hotel ; you can imagine what 's go in the lobby every day ... people with the luggage ; come ; leaving.. quite depressing place . i could recommend it a a temporary accommodation in the west bay for those who just come in qatar ; have a workplace in west bay and be intend to look for the place to live at the same area..
 i have lot of idea send me the money and i will direct it to your instructor ... ...

 so far i know that all the original certificate should be attest and keep a translated one with you when you gon na submit for any government department .

 please be careful . pay two riyal more and buy good quality shawarma only .
 higher ; high ... the market demand it
 what do you mean official ? any report be only guesswork . yes ; some landlord be put their rent up because there 's a demand on certain property in the market . anything that 's popular and decent quality will probably see a year on year raise ... if you do n't like it ; they just rent to the next person . on average though ; there really should n't be a raise !
 it depend on your house rent contract . my contract be yearly ; and this year they increase the house rent by 6 percent .
 yes !

 it vary no 2 baby be alike . you need to ask your doctor and trust your instinct a a mother .
 dear lauraferns ; i 'd suggest you to watch your baby 's growth closely and at some time around 4-6 month ; you may notice that your baby be not get enough from your milk . ( this be purely subjective but you be the best person to make the decision ) . at this stage ; you can start a little ( spoonfuls ) of rice water ; egg yolk ; a few squirt of orange juice etc.. ; in the beginning and if you find that everything be go well ; then you can introduce some more new items- one a week or so . gradually you will find that your baby be enjoy all these new food . remember to keep up with the breast milk as long a possible along with these wean food . if you would like to include cereal ; you could do that too . by 1 year of age the infant should have have a taste of everything you ever want him/her to . i would advise you not to add sugar or salt additionally in any food item because you may be introduce an unwanted habit for life . good luck with the weaning . ap
 no 2 baby be alike.check with your doctor . i start semi solid for my kid after 6 month and solid after a year..
 whats the right age to start solid or semi solid for a infant ? ? mums please suggest ... ... ... ..
 from what i 've be tell and have read ... it 's best to wait until six month for most baby ( always check with the baby 's doctor ) . this be a great website that i use often for food recommendation for baby : http : //www.wholesomebabyfood.com/ they also have great information on what food to avoid until the baby be old . good eating to you baby !
 best age to introduce semi solid be when the baby be 6 month old . do not introduce salt and sugar to baby 's meal untill he/ she be 1 year .
 thank u all
 for what i have read in the site ; yes there be a way . since your current sponsor/employer do not want to give release/noc then move back to your country ; wait for 2 year and then come back . sorry but if you can not get noc then the most likely situation be for you to go back home . regards ! !
 if they do n't give you a noc the only way be to go back.. but when your old company and the new company have same sponsor ; then the new company can ask for the noc and hire you and you dont have to wait for 2 year !
 this may be- if your employer dont have work and not give you salary human right commission help some time ; but dont ask me where be they ?

 ok here be my advice . fill in qatar before you leave then fill up again just when you be leave the saudi boarder ; this will be the saudi side before the uae boarder . this should be enough for to get to abu dhabi or even dubai . because if you miss this petrol station then the next station within in uae be atleast 100km . this be from my experience of 2007 ; i dont know if they have build any more petrol station since then . also a small factor to consider be that petrol in qatar and saudi be cheap than uae . have a safe trip .
 there be many petrol station from uae-ksa border to abu dhabi
 there be a petrol station less than a kilometer after go thru the saudi border from qatar ( right side ) . there be another one a few kilometer before exit saudi to the uae ( left side ) . there be a petrol station a few kilometer after pass thru the uae border ( right side ) . this be the last petrol station along the highway before reach abu dhabi proper . keep in mind the petrol price in uae be 3x compare to saudi . i hope this help . have safe trip .
 round abouts name every round about in qatar have a name but how to identify ; i never find any nameboard on r/as
 mostly name after a landmark ; building or office nearby ... . like manna'i round about ; marmar palace round about ; wholesale market round about etc . some be funny though ... like the slope round about coz of the slope in the round about .
 so plzzzz help.. where can we find a list of all those funny places.. correspond to a decent map.. ?
 r/a identify by the near landmark .

 bottled water price in qatar i really need to find out the price of bottled water in qatar . i would like to see the price of high end bottle water ; like evian ; and need the price and the place that you price it at . it would help me out a lot if you could just jot down the price of water at the local store and post them for me ; or give me a link to a local store where i can look at their price on the internet ; if possible . thank you .

 ziplock bag ; chocolate chip and pie pan you can get here in almost all the shop ( definitely shoprite & megamart ) . canned pumpkin - sorry do n't eat it but they seem to sell every other kind of canned product here ! cookbooks and book - loads of place to buy book here so do n't worry . a lot of people organise book swap and the best place to buy them be all the table top sale ! diet root beer - ca n't help you on that one but shoprite seem to sell a lot of american brand drink but they be quite pricey . i would be really careful bring them over though in case they leak etc . www.qaws.org
 excess baggage ? looking on a couple of other thread and have read a couple of blog ; tell me if i should pack in my excess baggage : canned pumpkin chocolate chip pie pan and in household good : ( not sure if they will ship food ) diet root beer ziplock bag book supply curious about : cookbooks ( though seriously i can get anything from the internet ; still ; you get your tried/trues . . . ) is it hard to find us measure cookbook ?
 canned pumpkin be sometimes available at megamart ; but if you want some for this thanksgiving then i would bring it with you just to be sure . i do bring a heap of ziplocs with me from the u.s . they 're pricey here and i have only find the good freezer bag at megamart for $ $ $ . seriously ; i go to costco and purchase a couple of pack of the gallon and a couple of the quart . have n't regret it yet . . .but . . .i also have a 40 ' container and almost no furniture so it be a no-brainer for me . you can get chocolate chip here ; but in the event that you 're a chocolate connoisseur do n't count on the good stuff . the waxy-tasting nestle be about as good a you 'll get for chocolate chip .
 best place for bake stuff ( include chocolate chip ) be shoprite - they have hersheys choc chip : d ... one for me ... one for the cookie dough ... giant stores do cheap freezer bag of every size imaginable but they 're not the zip one they 're just the press shut ones.. www.qaws.org
 fresh ? i find very little of our produce to fall under the category of what i would call `` fresh '' ; ) yes ; bring some canned pumpkin just in case megamart run out . you can find regular ol ' ziplocs or generic ziploc-types .. .but the freezer bag that really hold up be not readily available unless you pay $ $ at megamart . ( that say ; i have n't try shoprite . )
 all 5 thanksgivings i have have here . just do n't wait until the last minute and you 'll be fine . i still have 3 can from last year in fact . i can buy freezer bag practically anywhere . decent choc chip come and go . just stock up when they be here and put them in your freezer . i do buy cookbook in the us each summer ; only have find british one here ( besides the us current best seller -- which be expensive ! ) diet root beer can also be find -- sometimes . i try to find a pie pan all last year and know they never have a proper one at the grocery store . i buy a new pie pan in the us this summer . my advice : do n't bring food . my employer do n't allow it anyway ; and most do n't .
 at the end of the day you get use to stock up on what you like when you find it here ; and if you ca n't then learn to substitute or do without . i stop bring food back year ago . our bed mattress be the best thing we bring over . ca n't find the quality here .
 do n't stress about the pie pan ; i buy three of them and we 'll be go to sri lanka for thanksgiving - it 's the same a second eid ( al adha . ) mandi
 mandi ; good stock up on cranberry sauce too ! ! ! we 'll take it all mwa ha ha ah . splenda be available here in the diabetic section of most grocery store - i would n't bother bring it with you sj . signature line > `` you ca n't fix stupid ''
 i 'm bring the splenda cause we just stock up at costco before we get the interview . that stuff be expensive and very lightweight : ) i appreciate the syrup suggestion and all the others . how bout coffee ? do they have foldgers ( husband 's fave ) . he be get weird about the idea of not get his ( exactly the same every day lunch ) prefer food .
 diet root beer be sell at megamart and various store ; i can hook you up lol it 's a & w brand
 hi there ; definately bring out the splenda cause it cost a bunch here ... i actually have a friend of mine bring it out for me each time she come from the states ... all the other stuff you will get here - might be a bit pricy than what you would pay there but hey - as long a you can get it . the root beer be not to sure about ... .

 well there be a under sea breakdown again near egypt : ' ( noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
 saw a news about the under water cable be sever in tunisia - sicily ; italy area ; ; ; accord to cnn ; europe ; north africa ; me-asia will be affect ...  veni ; vidi ; vici .
 yep ; here it be ; apparently qatar be face 73 % reduction ; and fix date be either 25dec or 31dec ! : ( : ( : ( http : //fibresystems.org/cws/article/yournews/37128
 things seem good for me today than they be yesterday . web browsing be only slightly slow than usual .
 agree browsing have be much well ; yesterday when i do manage to get qtel on line ; all the customer helpdesk could tell me be they be face some general issue ; nd that it should be fix in 2-3 hr lol and the cable gon na take atleast 15 days..
 yeeaahh ... inteerrrnnetttt iiiissss vvveeryy sllooowww.. nooowwwww i'mmm jjuusssttt pplllayyiiinnggg fffiiiffaaa.. < b > cheer ; paul < /b >
 since the initial problem when the cable first break qtel or whoever will have re-routed thing to other cable . that 's why thing be a bit well now . but thing may get bad again tomorrow when the weekend be over and business be back to work .
 i have really slow speed and packet loss this morning ; then it improve for a bit . now it 's pretty bad again . i think we can look forward to one or two week of bad surfing .
 qtel internet sloooooow ... something wrong ? ? ! from today 4 pm local time ; internet be drag here ; be it just me or whole qatar ? a always qtel customer service suck sh* ; 20 mins no one pick yet ; i hang up.. anyones be feelin the same.. seem 2mb line isnt that fast eh ? lol ... remember the last time it happen some under sea cable break up..hope it not all again.. abdallah
 hmm..again . `` ..breakdown of a submarine cable network in the ... sea ... '' in this event ; qtel have be rather efficient then . so ; all the complaint i hear about qtel be ( more or less ) in the past . great ! today 's connection be fine but a tallg say ; when the govt office and all other business get back online ; the traffic might cause a jam . we 'll see.. ***************************************** do n't want no drama ; no ; no drama ; no ; no ; no ; no drama
 it take me 2 hour before i can see all your comment and another 30 minute before i can post mine ... what a day ... ..hope they fix it immediately
 they estimate it will take til end of the year to fully fix the problem . i expect that the service will slowly improve a time go by .
 ive never hear about any `` the under water cable be sever '' till i come to qatar . in middle east for some reason it happen few time a year..why in the north american part of the world `` the under water cable '' never severs ? < i > < b > ********************* you become responsible forever for what you have tame . antoine de saint-exupry < /b > < /i > < img src= '' http : //cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif '' >
 you 'd be less likely to notice even if they do ; a most of the site you access from north america be in north america . i expect you 'll find local site be load at usual speed ( try www.gulf-times.com ; for example ) . it 's the overseas one that be slow ( like ql ) .
 i doubt many website be actually host in qatar ; or the middle east . most will be in the us .
 actually it seem gulf times in host in the us a well .
 does anyone know a company that host it website in qatar ? i 've find two : http : //www.qatar.net.qa/ - qtel http : //www.moi.gov.qa/ - ministry of interior most of the top-10 local site ( nine ; probably ) be host in usa . any others in qatar ?
 ql use to host with mediatemple ; which be base on virtualized server ; but when the traffic take off they switch to < a href= '' http : //rimuhosting.com/ '' > rimuhosting < /a > . there be now two data centre in doha . one run by qtel ; the other by meeza ; which be part of qf . i just do n't know the reason why any non-governmental website would host in either of them . i know that before ql switch to rimuhosting ; they be pay $ 100 a month for host . now ; i 'm sure they 're pay more ; but not huge amount more . both qtel and meeza be never go to be able to compete on price . nor be they go to be able to compete on support . ql be number-three in the top-10 website in qatar ; and it run on free software . < a href= '' http : //www.qatarliving.com/user/kutch '' > kutch < /a > do a great job of run the local free-software group ; but there just be n't the number of linux expert in qatar to be able to provide good support service . the other reason you might not want to host in qatar be the local legal framework . hosting in the usa be sometimes frustrating if you receive a barrage of dmca takedown notice ; but at least the law be well-documented . here ; you ca n't be sure that someone with a bit of wasta would n't make a phone call to qtel and shut you down . of course ; there might be a technical reason to host here . if you need low latency . maybe the data centre be full of company ' file server ? however ; even if i be run an system that require a low ping ; surely it 's a safe bet to host in dubai ? any example of locally host website ? ? ?
 yup it undersea cable cut check out today gulf time it all splash on the front page

 no govern rule will work here practically . if the landlord want to increase the rent he can create any reason to send you out from his property . now no need to worry about the increse in rent . rent be come down drastically . change the house
 if you have a write contract with the owner ; and this contract be sign on or after 01/01/2005 then he have no right to increase your rent up to 14/02/2010 a per the law . if the contract be sign before 01/01/2005 then an increase shall occur a per the follow table : -rent amount less than qr 2000 > > > 20 % -rent amount between 2000-5000 > > > 15 % -rent amount between 5000-10000 > > 10 % -rent amount more than 10000 > > > > > 5 % in addition he can not kick u out unless you do not pay the monthly rent ; or if you rent the flat to others ; or if he want to use the appartment by him or his family mambers ; or if he want to demolish the building and most of the above have to be through court evidence ; ; ; also there be 6 month afetr you get the information in write before evacuation .
 rents be suppose to be freeze until feb 2010 . just find a new place . you will likely find good and cheap . leave your greed stricken landlord without a tenant . that will wake him up with no income come in .
 well the rent depend on the area where you want to live ... stay in doha city area be still expensive even you transfer to a new flat or villa . if you have car ; you can get a cheap room outside doha and just get-up earlier when go to work .

 to avoid unwanted attention from others ; it be best for your wife to wear clothing that cover her knee and shoulder . also best to make sure no skin around the waist/hips be show ; and no cleavage !
 a reminder from your brother . it be always good to wear the dress which god ask u to wear . it can be use every part of the world . so please please try to know what our `` creator the lord of heavens & earth '' ask u to do . and let u practice it . then no worry .

 alcohol at the pearl am i correct in think that none of the restaurant at the pearl be allow to sell alchol anymore ?
 at the upper right . click it ; it 's still hot ! lol !
 yes macavela you right since 1 mount ago the stop thim to sale alchol .
 flor1212 there be no need to be rude ; i 'm not in doha at the moment so i be out the loop ! tamer awaad thanks ! how come they have stop them ? what a shame !
 yup ... alchohol be only 'suspended ' from sale on the pearl ( not officially ban ) . give them around 5 more month and it will return back to full alchohol sale . this ban remind me of a 1998 ban on woman smoke 'shisha ' ( hookah pipes ) . it be later lift . its kind of qatars way to calm the religious leave when they have an incident . i would of thought maybe a religious man kid come back home drunk and file a complaint or something ? just a guess .
 @ op ... you be not in doha and so out of the loop but still can call a shame for the ban . btw how do you get think that pearl ban alcohol . and just two word `` pearl alcohol '' return me the two late thread on the issue and i think irrespective of whether you be in doha or not if you can access ql you can run the search on it too ... lazy people ... . : ( ( http : //www.qatarliving.com/node/2364470 http : //www.qatarliving.com/node/2440403
 a suspension that will eventually be lift when sale be down at the restaurant ; which all have qatari investor who wo n't want to watch their profit dwindle .
 do you even care to read those thread bachus ?
 united development company ( udc ) ; the developer of the pearl-qatar ; issue a statement announce the resignation of khalil sholy ; it manage director and president ; on thusrday ; reuters report . http : //www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/12/idusl6e8cc3bv20120112
 http : //m.arabianbusiness.com/qatar-alcohol-ban-could-be-tip-of-iceberg-for-gcc-440454.html qatars move to ban the sale of alcohol on it flagship pearl development may hint at the start of a gulf-wide clampdown on booze sale a government look to pacify local fear ; analyst say . the gcc state may move to rein in sale and tighten alcohol legislation in a bid to walk the line between the expatriate population and their muslim citizen in the wake of the arab spring unrest ; say guy wilkinson ; manage partner at dubai hospitality consultancy ; viability . qatar be hardly the first gulf state in which the local population have express it concern over the sale of alcohol ; he tell arabian business . following the arab spring ; i expect muslim party to have more and more influence over the control of alcohol throughout the region . the sale of alcohol be strictly monitor in five of the gulf state with saudi arabia operate an outright ban on the sale and consumption of liquor . the move to offer alcohol license to outlet and non-muslims be largely a nod to the region expatriate worker ; who vastly outnumber the local population . but the decision have be meet with criticism from some citizen who oppose the sale of liquor in muslim country . qatar retain comparatively tight rule govern alcohol consumption ; say wilkinson . just a few year back ; one could only find it in just a few luxury hotel and club with strict entry procedure ; he say . the fact that it population have increase so fast over the last few year have evidently not change the concern of muslims over the potential ill effect of alcohol consumption ; particularly in term of moral behaviour . chiheb ben mahmoud ; head of hotel advisory ; for mena at jones lang lasalle ; say the open sale of alcohol be always a delicate balance for gulf government . sometimes ; local public opinion be heat up on the back of a combination of factor . it be common for authority in these case to act swiftly in order to defuse tension and prevent the issue from heat up far and get out of control ; he say . the suspension of sale on the pearl could be see a a wake-up call or a reminder of the invisible red line not to be cross .
 when it 's already a compromise between the host and the visitor . and surely ; the noisy one will keep blah blah blah ! it 's just a choice between `` more money less booze or less money more booze '' ! lol ! in saudi ; it 's `` more money and illegal booze '' ; and the expat survive there !
 alcohol at the pearl am i correct in think that none of the restaurant at the pearl be allow to sell alchol anymore ?
 qlrules -- i see you be new to ql ; so welcome !
 oh my dayz ! when will you ppl stop ranting and raving and cry to heaven above for the suspicion of booze in qatar ? this be totally ridiculous ! ! well just for the record ; alcohol sale have be suspend only at the pearl ... .that 's just one focking tiny area of the fockin city of doha aight ? . other outlet and hotel and still get it on their menu ; besides if you just care to walk in to qdc im sure you can notice the availability of liquor at these store . i 'm get very piss off about the situation here ; in the sense that so many expat be just outrage that this one section of the city have have sale suspend ! ! so they run to ql to bit-ch about it ; a tho if without alcohol ; the world would crumble tomorrow . ! ! ! pffff give it a fockin rest . if you need booze that bad ; you have a problem. ! and if living in another culture be so difficult because you may not be able to drink ; then you might want to consider just go home to your comfort zone .
 wait 'til they be sober ; they wo n't understand you ! lol ! btw ; it 's suspension ; not suspicion ! lol ! no offense ; dc ! hehehehehh !

 hi mojo ; i dont think the traffic department will charge you for change your engine except you need to have/keep a receipt from where you will buy the engine for future police check or at the annual technical inspection .
 the vin decode the `` engine type '' . in the case of my car it identify the engine type a : 4.7l v8 sohc 16v if you change it to a v-6 engine ; the code will be wrong !

 house . she stay alone . but i 'll have to ascertain that you be safe .
 we must know your nationality ; secondly ; your male friends never get a visit visa for you a only husband ; father ; brother or any blood relation can apply for a visit visa ; qatar be a safe place if you have self confidence . you can not stay with male in a hotel or any apartment unless you prove that he be your brother ; father or husband .
 load and load of hotel here to stay ... and ton of flat ; house ; villa be empty : )
 u can get tourist visa by your own but it will cost you so much ; so if you have friend here in doha ask them to get visa for you from some agency such a cleaopatra or fahad . regard job issue you can get job easily in doha and that depend on your experience but you have one strong point with you and that be you be fm and it easy for fm to get job here in doha . for accomodation you can ask your friend to find bed space for you till you will not get job so in this way you will be not spend so much for your accomodation . doha be safe place for everyone comparing to another gcc country ; but still you have to be carefull from bad people and they be everywhere in all country . good luck and hope you will enjoy in doha .
 i love you ; if you be the one same in ur avataar pic ... . : )
 i be alone ; so i have to love myself ... . my hand hurt : o (
 pmsl brit ...
 brit you love with your hand ? i hear people love with their heart ! !

 when i be a child ; or even teenager i be love deeply and strongly ; but now i realize that 99 % of ppl dont know whats love ; dont know whats loyalty ! ! unfortunately this be the truth ; when i look for a good friend i dont care for his religion/nationality/nor language ; goodness be everywhere but it rare
 live to love yourself or others ? do you live to love yourself or to love others ?
 love all around and do n't expect to be loved in return !
 i live to be love ... . : )

 novita77 : you be more than welcome : ) let me know what you think after your experience .
 i know you always give a chance for friend to express themselves ===================================== http : //www.qatarliving.com/node/58409
 well pitstop i do n't mean to offend you or the chef . i be sure there have to be more then one person work on the sushi . maybe i just get the wrong one . novita i will try la cigele 's . and curious if anyone have try sakura 's yet at the ramada ? please pass the number of your friend .
 as i mention above maybe i be expect sth different . all i know about japanese culture be from movie . and if you do not try to make a lil search and try to know about a new culture -like me- ; you can feel disappointment sometimes . for example i be feel admire for japanese people because they be almost the leader of robotic technology ; and for electronics they be also on the top . but sometimes when i experience that it be very hard for some people to understand sth simple you be disappointed . in any case i admire japanese people because they could build a strong and developed country after such a massive destruction at wwii while keep their own tradition . and if we return to our original theme i love sushi too . am glad that they be so good at it ; )
 default nick : do n't worry about it . we be all not how we expect ourselves to be . i hope that make sense . and about learn different culture ; i live in japan for 9 year ; so i know what you be talk about . back to sushi ; anyone want a free go at oishi sushi : p ? ?
 sushi hi qlers . i have see a restaurant which will serve susjhi ; be open near crepaway at ramada corner but be there any place currently serve sushi ?
 pitstop ! yes pls : p
 pitstop ; i be joke : ) i can afford the sushi lol . dont mind to have a sushi blind date sometimes with you though : ) only hear about you but never meet before ...
 pitstop ; that would be nice .
 agree with novita . `` what do n't kill me ; make me strong ... ''
 i just want to give some feedback for people who be interested . i try sushi minto last thursday . the atmosphere and the service be also good . they have a variety from sushi to some fast food . my friend try salmon and he say it be nice too . for the rest i will continue to give further info . peace `` what do n't kill me ; make me strong ... ''

 there be instance that you can get back within short span of time here in doha ; state in the law also ; that when you be clear and give eit visa you can not come bck to doha until 2 yr but in case ; there be some company give to their employee whom dont have any trouble make or clean and neat in the workplace ; no problem give to the company ; have give the visa exit clearance only and can come bakc any time since this be exit clearance not cancellation of work visa ; by the time you go home already the validity of your pataqa will be count for ; if you have reach the expiration of your pataqa and do not come back as soon a possible then the company ca declare null & void and this will be work out by the mandoob for automatic cancellation of your work visa ... ...
 in addition ; it be also clear state by the labor law of qatar that once you be cancel ; the work visa be still on work condition but the company whom you have work for will give you re-entry visa for go back here and work with the same company otherwise automatic discharge of the work permt on the side of the company and no more excuse but you will get back after 2 yr .

 they say that the patient should be here in doha so that they can make an action . but unfortunately my mom ca n't travel anymore . = (
 cancer patient is there any charity or foundation here that maybe can help to a cancer patient ? or let 's just say i be a son of a cancer victim ; who do n't know what to do if i 'm go home in pi to be with and to take care of my mom or still stay here in doha because i be the bread winner in the family and need to work so that i can send them their allowance ? ? ? anyone can help me ? any good samaritan ? ?
 dear kasheem ; if im in your situation i will go back to my back home.i know you be the bread winner.but since your mother cant travell and she cant come to doha.so you have to go.otherthan suffering.because every single minute you will feel you be live hell.and your mother also happy when you be her side.i know money be main problem.ask some help people around you.if i have money i will give you.but im jobless.so ask for help.may be you feel it stupid idea.but i will do same if i be you.asking money be difficult.but in this world most presious one be your mom.so go back.other than suffer .
 thanks and your comment be really so true but my big problem be i do n't have money to use ; and i do n't know where to ask . it 's really so bad that i cant do anything to go back home and be with my mom ; my mom miss me a lot and i miss her also . it be already more than a year that i be here in doha and away from my mother . i love my mom so much because she be the only one who raise u ; she be single parent my dad leave u when i be just 5 year old . and i know how hard it be be single parent raise 3 kid . and now cant even do anything to be with her side . = (
 its a nice enough car but underpowered particularly in low gear a you start to accelerate - youve really get to `` floor it '' .
 you have to visit kia sr to obtain more information or check the review of the car to http : //www.thecarconnection.com/overview/kia for more info please send your query to jesnetkia @ gmail.com or 55107890
 part and maintenance be cheap but performance be cheap too..better to buy a toyota coz the kia rate be close to toyota too in some model .
 thank you very much for this information . i guess i have to think twice before buy this rio because i red negative review about this car and just want to know from those who have the experienced use this
 dont make a silly mistake ; go for nissan tiida
 i have a kio rio hatchback since 2005 and absolutely maintenance free so far.yes the pickup be slow but it a pleasure drive it . go for it .
 kia overall have the best price on the market ; compare to most brand in qatar . their quality be comparable to these 'top ' japanese brand like toyota ; honda or nissan . now ; chairboy have bring a valid point - the kia rio version that be be sell in qatar be a little bit underpowered . i own a 2010 rio and besides this ; i have no complains about the car . i just i could own a manual version but for security reason be always good to have automatic shift so other member of the family could drive it . the plus be : price and quality and the new model be much nicer and good look than it predecessor . the big no ! particularly in qatar : the quality of service . unfortunately they only have one service center in this country ; which be locate in the industrial area . in many case they could take up to two day just for an oil change ... last time the car be seldom wash and they do not vacuum it inside . there be a big rumour that they will be open a new service center near the old airport area ; unless this be true i would not consider buy a new kia but if they do ; i would give it a go .
 kia be a good car ; i be use a 2008 kia optimum and it hasnt give me any trouble so far . all i have to change be the break pad battery ; glass wiper and the headlight bulb which be very normal accesories to change in any car . the part be very cheap . if i recollect i hardly spend less than 500 riyal for the break pad and the glass wiper . the part be easily available at the kia service centre in industrial area . the pick up be good and the ac be excellent . you should consider buy a kia ;
 is kia a good car hello ql ; is kia a good car . how about it part ; be it available anywhere . is it expensive how about the maintenance of this car . is worth it to buy this type of brand . im thinking of buy a rio . please help need advice
 http : //www.thecarconnection.com/overview/kia
 there be another con that can be resolve with little or no skill . the cabin ac filter be too small and they easily get stack with this dusty weather ; usually my commute be from very short distance so in 2 year mine be just 13 ; 000kms meaning that i do n't do much service in it ; one thing i learn be to replace the cabin ac filter kit for maximum efficiency . the kit would cost from 50 to 100 qar and it only take 10 minute to replace it .
 btw ; my first car in doha be a 2007 kia sorento . i buy this car second hand from a british couple . we still have it and my wife be drive it . i 've do some offroad at the inland sea and let me tell you ; i be shock with the performance . our most recent trip be with two friend ; both drive their lc prado ( v6 version ) and they could not believe what this sorento be capable of do . kia be probably the most underrated brand . as i say ; service be my main concern ; other than that it 's great for the money .
 'cos kia give a 7 year warranty on new car sell in uk . clearly they have faith in their reliability . i 've drive a kia sportage and it 's ok. good value for money .
 thank ql for give me these comment and suggestion . how about hyundai . i think kia and hyundai are now seperate company . any comment on this brand and how they perform on the road . is it cheap than kia ? how about it maitenance and part cost ?
 kia be a good car ... sportage be quite good ... but not the late model : (
 favoritetrick ; hyundai be also pretty good - can not comment on their service since it 's run by a different group in qatar . be aware that kia and hyundai be very similar in spec and spare part . i 've see many spare part box brand a kia/hyundai .
 they 're similar - the last time i survey ; kia be slightly low . just to give you an idea : rio = accent elantra = optima sportage = tucson sorento = santa fe etc ... etc ...
 the best thing you to do be to visit all your prospect brand ; do a test drive and so on ... . kia rio ( accent ; aveo ; sunny ; yaris ; honda city ; lancer ) here in qatar kia they be give 5 yrs warranty or 100000 km . cheers ! !
 no ; because she have no booby !
 educational ! hi ql ! could anyone here suggest where to find a site where schedule of different seminar be posted.. ? and where to enroll an acadmey that offer a voccational or taining course good for month and on night shift classes..and of course w/ cheap tuition fee. ! hehehe thanks guy !

 qatarbrat ; dont be so quick . pallash ; first you may want to make sure that your husband be eligible to sponsor you ; i.e . he meet certain requirement set up by the qatari authority
 i be sure a an engineer your husband will be get the minimum salary requirement ( qr . 7000 ) for apply your visa .
 u need the following document to apply for ur visa . ur husband 's salary certificate . noc from ur husband 's employer . ur husband 's qid copy . ur and ur husband 's passport copy . attested ( indian foriegn affairs-delhi ) copy of ur marriage certificate . ( here also need attestation by indian embassy and expatriate affairs.-for attestation u need original marriage certificate here. ) if ur husband have all these document with him he can directly go to gharraffa emigration and submit the application.ur husband 's company 's pro also can do it . fees qrs.200/- then u will get family visit visa . ur entry visa 's validity up to 1 month . after ur entry in qatar u want to go to medical check up . then u can get 5 month more.fees qrs.200/- per month . u can stamp it in ur passport monthly or 5months together . then ur husband can apply a permanent visa for u in this period.it can start immediate after ur entry here or after five month . for permanent visa also u want to follow up the same procedure . ( like new application ) ur husband need minimum 7000/- riyal salary . ( minimum 3months bank statement must ) . electricity and water bill ( it should be in the name of ur husband . ) if ur husband 's company provide company 's accommodation to him give proof of it ; then no need for electricity bill . ur medical check up validity be for 6 month . if u will get permanent visa with in this period u do n't want to under go the medical check up again . goodluck if u need some more information regard this ; do n't hesitate to send a pm to me .
 family visit visa : hello ; ask ur husband to visit qatar immigration office along with belove these 1 ) wife pp copy 2 ) husband rp copy 3 ) husband pp copy 5 ) marriage certificate copy 6 ) salary statement ( must 7.500 qr ) if lessthan this they will ask you many question . once he have these all ; he can get application for apply visit visa for his spouse . once he fill the form and after the submission he will get the appointment through sms . during the inerview he may answere some question . once pass they will issue the visit visa . wife can stay with husband sponser ship up to 2 month without processing of rp . if she want to stay morthan 3 month she must go for medical test in order to rp process .

 your residence permit be expire . it mean you do not have any residence permit . the grace period be give to finalize your matter in qatar in case you do n't have enough time ; and to leave the country . grace period do n't mean you have a valid rp . and since you do not have an rp ; what the he 'll be you go to transfer ? you have to renew your rp with your current sponsor ; after that you can transfer your rp .
 transferring visa after the expiry is it possible to transfer qatari visa to another sponcor after the expiry ? i know that it be leagal to stay in the country for 90 day after the expiry of visa ; but will i have problem transfer visa to another sponcor after it expire ?
 ..and how many day can one stay if the visa be cancel .
 i think if your sponsor give you noc then you have to pay the palenty of qr 200 per day and you can proceed ; but it be well that you should consult some legel advisor ;
 the question be : how legal be to do the new visa with a new company after the expiry of the present visa without leave qatar ? my present sponsor 's agree to give me noc . he be frightning me that immigration will not do the new visa for me a the old one wil be expire .
 if you have submit your case for sponsorship change before expiry and when your case of change be in process and your visa expire then it be okand you have to pay only fine.i think fine be qr 200
 average ; but not good .

 hi soniya ; good question . the only reason i can think of it be that the garage guy might not believe in my version of the story . anyways ; if you can help ; please do : )
 ok..thnx for ur explanation..i ca n't help u buddy ; sorry..
 soniyaji ; it be prevail traffic rule in qatar ; if it be slightly scratch or damage while reverse ; park etc . ; still it be well to go to traffic and show them ; get a clearance paper ; then go to insurance with their specify garage to get it repaired . there by you be safe at the time of istimara pass your car annually .
 with out a police report ; garage guy will not agree to repair ur car . u need to go to ploce station & should pay 112 riyal to get the letter .
 if a car damage ; no matter it be your own fault or by someone else 's ... a police report be a must in either case it 's a rule here .
 thanks for the advice guy . i think it better for me to take the police report . one more question . since i have third party insurance ; i dont think i will get reimbursement ; be that right ? what be the third party insurance rule here for hit and run where we cant see the car who hit ? ? ?

 check this web site ; http : //www.britishcouncil.org/kids
 aside from tutorial ; you can help him by watch english tv shows/listening to english song only while you be in your house and the child be also watching/listening ( be aware of obscene word though ) . a child 's mind be like a sponge ; it can absorb easily and promptly and though he could not understand the word at first ; they will not be so foreign-sounding to him at least . another way be to read bedtime story to him in english . kadaut ...
 yes i do agree with arecel ... bring some comic book and some child movie for him it 's the best way for learn english .
 rp ; what be exactly his problem ? be it spell ? reading and writing ? if it 's spell ; let him read and read and play backgammon ; scrabble or anything that would allow him to read the word . it will be easy to remember the spelling this way . same strategy for read problem . if it be write per se ; teach him how to write the alphabet first then gradually introduce him to simple word . kadaut ...

 that tom cruise daughter name.. the los angeles times summarize the write statement cruise release on the birth a say the name `` be a word with origin in both hebrew and persian . in hebrew ; it mean 'princess ' and in persian ; 'red rise ; ' it be claim in the release . `` [ 19 ] however ; magazine and blog note on cruise 's mistranslation on suri 's hebrew meaning . [ 20 ] in hebrew ; suri actually mean `` from syria '' ; not `` princess '' . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] the wrong etymology might stem from the fact that suri be a yiddish pet form of sarah ; which mean `` princess '' . [ 23 ] curiously ; in japanese 'suri ' can mean `` pickpocket . `` [ 24 ] in korean ; 'suri ' be a conjugation of the verb 'to repair ' ( mechanical device ) .
 both you and your husband each come up with 5 girl name and 5 boy name . that 's if you do n't know the gender yet . i suggest names with family/cultural meaning . then each of you get to strike 2 girl/boy names off of each other list -- no explanation . then try to whittle it down from there . use compromise . for my 2nd son ; my husband pick out a name right off the bat . i think it be so so ; but 9 month later i have n't think of any that i be crazy about and since my husband loved the name he pick out ; i decide that it really must matter to him and so we go with the name he like . this should be a fun experience !
 another comment -- why worry about it so much yet ? for all of my 5 child we go to the hospital with a list of name ; then when the child be bear and we meet him/her and discover their personality ; we go with the name that seem to fit them best . sometimes just see your baby will help you to instantly decide what their name should be . it 's almost a if they tell you themselves what they want to be name .

 yes ! they will not let you out of the country before you pay the fine .
 yes ; else you will be bar from leave the country
 i always settle traffic violation during registration and never have problem leave country be frequent flyer ... how ?
 you will only have to pay the violation before travel if the fine be register to your qatar id . so for a speeding fine that a radar caught you do will be register to the vehicle and not your id in which case you will be fine . if you get stop at a roundabout for not wear a seatbelt and the police man ask for your license ; then the fine would regisetred against your id ; in which case you would have to pay the fine before travel .
 should traffic violation be settle before travel on vacation ? should traffic violation be settle before travel on vacation ?
 it be only mandatory if you resign and leave qatar for good ... but for frequent flyer not necessary .
 qatars department of traffic and patrol police have say motorist who have outstanding fine will not be allow to leave the country once a new law come into force this week ; report the peninsula . potential violator can access the ministry of interiors website from october 2 to check for any possible fine . meanwhile fine will increase at a rate of qr1 per day if they be not pay within 60 day . via : ameinfo

 because of the inferiority complex in some of the `` muslim '' ql poster ...
 why be islam discuss the most ? i may be wrong ; but of all the religion or lack of ; why be islam the most discussed religion on ql ; and others be meerly refer to in comparrison during debate ? if so ; why be it that islam be the most argued religon here ?
 respect ramadan ! coz this kind of thread turn on bash religion for those qlers have the spoil mind ... note :
 because many people have a bee in their bonnet regard islam . also ; because some muslims portray a holy than thou attitude .
 with the number of foreigner ; perhaps the non muslims outnumber the muslims..
 because islam be get divide in two ... ... ..the real islam and the islam of the mulla . aana free ; jaana free ; pakde gaye tho khana free .

 it 's those who do n't have sex who talk about it all the time .

 why be islam discuss the most ? i may be wrong ; but of all the religion or lack of ; why be islam the most discussed religion on ql ; and others be meerly refer to in comparrison during debate ? if so ; why be it that islam be the most argued religon here ?
 touche ! however ; a gentleman never divulge what happen during these tryst : o )
 boys ; i 'd appreciate it if you would kindly refrain from hijack the thread : )
 here we go again ... .fed up with these asinine discussion ... . anyone get a good joke ... .here i get one ... . '' why be islam discuss the most '' .
 thats right thejam ; it look alien to u as far a christianity be concern ; comparitabily
 when one become narrow-minded and they easily get offend with it . sometimes the illogical part of the religious faith ( which seem to not adapt with the modern time ) tend to rise up a be legit and plenty of people who stay in a country bound by that certain religion have no choice but to make it look respectable ( there really be a difference between `` respect '' and `` making it look respectable '' ) to keep their adaptive ( 'corruptive ' be too direct a term ) freedom in bay . my explanation also work on other religion . we use to 'nitpick ' the jewish ( and even israel ) on the other side of the continent for the matter . some nitpicks be not nitpicks ; but a reflection of the reality ( if i do n't see it everyday ; i never would 've know the common obvious ) ... and some people just ca n't accept that ; hence they perceive it a a nitpick . `` everything in this book may be wrong . '' illusions : the adventures of the reluctant messiah by richard bach
 thejam ; well say lucid point ; herein lie the confusion . pitstop ; why do you think it should be ban ; how else can you explain the religon to many who want to know or debate ; besides be n't that a muslim duty to not shy from discussion regard his/her deen ; but to address and explain and debate ? qatarexplorer ; you also make valid point . yes ; some debater obviously appear to pose a muslim yet clearly be pregiduce . do n't you think that perhaps the debater you mention do n't actually hate islam ? people often attack and fear what they do n't understand ; it human psychology . i 'd like to believe that a great majority ; regardless of their negative comment ; be actually draw to islam because there be something undoubtedly real and logical about this religon and they may actually be search or yearn for answer . i only wish that some muslim would debate responsibly know that they be at that very moment represent islam in these people eye and therefore bear the responsibility of tolerance ; patient & respect when we be face with not so civilised debate because aldeen al akhlaq ( religon be manner ) this remind me of when the prophet mohammed pbuh be drive out of altayef with stone throw at him because they refuse his message ; then god send him the angels ( of wind and mountains ) and ask do you want vengence ? to this the prophet pbuh reply ( i cant quote accurately but the general jist of the response be ) 'they know not and perhaps one day good will come from this people '

 without a valid driving license from your home country you can not apply for a qatari driving license .
 ? ? ?
 definatley not a problem ; but a very good question that may answer a lot of people that maybe in the same situation in the future
 a follow up question ... .is it possible to get again ur exit permit from your sponsor or still valid ? how many day do exit permit valid ?
 exit permit be valid for 1 week from issuance..
 there be two type of exit permit . the type good for one use ; which expire if not use and and unlimited exit permit which be good for one year . you should ask for the unlimited kind ; if your sponsor be amenable ; which will avoid the hassle of have to get one each time you leave the country ( there be also a fee charge for the unlimited type ) ; but do n't be surprised if your sponsor refuse . there be no penalty for fail to use either type of exit permit .
 http : //www.emirates.com/english/plan sometimes public forum do not portrait a direct and straight forward answer but instead each and everyone 's experience . try contact either emirates or etihad and ask them . your last resource would be approach the uae embassy 's consular service and ask for guideline . regards ! !

 i mean there be 3 class like all airline but be amaze how they turn this to a upstairs like a 5 star hotel . pay abut $ 5000 usd for the first class ticket ; then more for the extra on the upstairs premium level like ; massage ; shower ; a bar etc ... ..not jelous ; but wow so nice . i just can not justify spend money like this for 1 day of travel . but those who can ; mabrouk
 you be still confuse . there be no upstairs in the b787 . the a380 be the one with upstairs . qatar airways have not start the a380 yet while emirates have .
 b-787 arrive yesterday at 10:50 utc or 13:50 doha time ; under the call sign `` qatari 3787 '' .. this particular aircraft a7-bcb ; would be use for a month to dxb in order for the flight deck crew to familiarize with the aircraft & from mid of december ; would start fly to london heathrow ... impo ; fares would be the same for economy class ; but yes for business class which have a configuration of 1-2-1 would have high fare compare to business class of 777s or 330s ...
 yep wont fly far then in gulf area until it get it wing : ) more flight time that be . enjoy if you can.i will stay with delta ... .for now ; sighhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

 such salary be okay incase you be economic and know how to manage your financial matter .
 it 's more than enough really . the major expense you will have be probably the phone . i can manage to spend about 25 rial on food everyday for 3 meal . over a month that bring a total of 750 . add some entertainment ( a book or two ) and you 're still under 1 ; 000 rial !

 i think it too less for a design engineer ; specially if you want to live with your family & kid ... which be the company offer so less ? ?
 yes u can ... coz you have a free accomodation and transportation .

 oh it badly !
 yes ; they have recently change the rule . pcc from the country of orgin be only accept the new rule be a big blow to the job aspirant
 yes ; they change rule & they change very frequently ; any certificate must be attest by home country 's ministry of forein affair & embassy in doha ; only then they attest ...
 foreign ministry attestation i go foreign ministry today for an attestation of a character certificate which be issue from bangladesh embassy . they say they do not attest that kind of certificate anymore and i have to bring police certificate from bangladesh attest by foreign ministry there . is the rule have be change or they just dont like my face : )
 they themselves be not sure what they be do . there be rumor that some of the certificates issue from the bd embassy be be accept though they have not inform the embassy that they will not accept the certificate issue by the embassy . i think it 'll take some time for them to come out of their confusion .
 it be change or amend . amendment require when and a necessary . even in sea & air port too . now most of the airline do not allow or encourage to carry liquid substance in flight after liquid bomb threat . law enforcement authority be their to protect u by amend exist / old law . v need to understand the situation & work accordingly.some time v ask the authority to amend the exist law ; when v fall in trouble.if u read daily news paper or the ministry sit ; u would have save ur time go there . cheer guy & b happy

 party venue dear all ; i be seek venue suggestion for birthday party of my child who would turn 5 soon . thanks in advance !
 and starbucks be own by a jewish consortium ... but i guess you just ca n't tell some people ... .. `` your born ; you live ; you die ; give this premise ; one can conclude since we have no control over when we be bear and when we die ; the only thing that matter to u should be how we live ; simple really ? '' mis-cat to her philosophy lecturer .
 i guess the birthday party will be at day time and not at 11pm red pope .
 rays reef at royal plaza ; al saad street . great venue . they have soft play area for little one ; a large soft play area with huge slide and climb for old one . a ball pool shoot area ; ; ball pool ; video game and an area for art and craft and painting and stuff like that . i think they charge 40qr for each child but that include a meal for each child aswell . plus they have underground parking and the staff take good care of the kid so you might be able to relax too ! ha ; ha .
 it be available her all over the place . the rate for the basic wii be about qr1300.-/1400.- . however the additional game be not really available.so compare price and make up your mind . however do buy the additional game to the package there . aisha-taweela
 wii+wii sport be 175 on amazon . the price aisha quote above work out at about 245 ; so cheap to buy the console in the uk and i expect cheap to buy the game in the uk a well . ( for example ; playstation 3 game cost about 60 here ; which be way more than in the uk . )
 it available here but if you get cheap from your foreign money ; why not buy it there . you might blame yourself later on in doha if you find out it cheaper in uk .
 if the person you be send money be trustworthy you can send thru western union .
 give it to me ... . : d : d ( kidding.. )
 send it via western union or xpress money .
 first end it to india ... .then they send to usa from there
 how to send money to usa hiii frnds ; i want to send some money to us ; how to send and what will be the service charge ? i want to send more than $ 1000
 if the other party have a bank acct in us send it by international bank wire ; .cheaper and faster then by money exchange company
 i think the salary limit of doha bank to get the loan be qr . 7000/- .
 try first finance it next to muntaza gas station .
 try with other bank ; if you have above 5 ; 000 salary it be not so difficult ; you need to give them salary certificate from company only .
 it depend on your bank sometimes ; if you have a qib account then go to al-jazeera ... i take my car from there without problem ... it take 10 day to finish it because they be not clear about what paper they need and keep ask for them 1 by 1 and of course you ca n't get those at one day ...
 try ibq . but again ; your salary have to be transfer and the company you be work for have to be approve at the bank . then you should be eligible for the loan if you meet the loan requirement . otherwise ; try finance institution such a first finance ; they might be able to finance you . regards ; hamad
 hamad you work for ibq do n't you ? ? try them though 4473000
 call 3450493-rahul he be into sale at cbq . try ur luck .

 u can get seed from ... from.. opz i forget the name of that shop . well i ll tell u the location.. if u be come from toyota signal to gulf cinema ; from gulf cinema signal take left.. if u take left ; first u can see that on ur right side..
 where can i get plant seed of road side grow plant ? i find in qatar many place on road side plantation be there ; it seem good ; in small size plant have lot of flower ; i wish to get that plant seed ; where it be available .it be possible to buy here .
 there be many plant shop at the central market behind the fish market
 you 've probably leave it too late for this year a it will soon be too hot for these plant . what i 'd suggest be when the plant naturally run to seed ; pick a few seed head and keep them till september ; then sow the seed in a good quality pot compost ready for next winter .
 try a nursery which sell plant
 petunia the one which be available in many color ( purple ; white ; yellow ; pink ; red ; mixed color ) doesnt easily come up when u sow the seed instead it better to buy a fresh plant with flower form any nursery ... garden nursery between gulf cinema and mall round abt be where i usually get plant from . marigold come in three to four variation and they grow from seed very well ... like wut baldrick say u cud try it in sep a it already get hotter ... chrysanthemum also u can find in roundabats and flower in bunch like the above two ; plant be well tahn try from seed . as far a seed be concern u cud get it from ffc ; lulu ; giant or any nursery ... .. enjoy gardening ... .

 he say fasten your seat belts..right ?
 it be all in arabic .
 apparently he recite the verse specify for get on board of a mean of transportation . it could be translate to : glory to him who have subject these to our use for we could never have accomplish this by ourselves . and to our lord surely must we return back .
 a quick question to arab speaking muslims whilst wait for my flight to dubai to take off ; the pilot start to speak in arabic . he say `` allah ackbar '' ( god be great ) and then carry on speaking.this speech wasnt translate into english so i have no idea what he say . does anybody know what he say please ?
 cos it be in arabic .
 he say # $ @ % ^ % $ #
 allahu akbar ; allahu akbar ; allahu akbar ; subhanal-ladhi sakhkhara lana hadha wa ma kunna lahu muqrinin . wa `` inna `` ila rabbina la-munqalibun allah be the most great . allah be the most great . allah be the most great . glory be to him who have provide this for u though we could never have have it by our effort . surely ; unto our lord we be return . as-sunnah as saheeha http : //www.islamlecture.com/
 i 'd rather have no prayer on board an aircraft . no matter which god you believe in ; i 'm sure ; in your book ; he 's do a great job . but ; surely the remainder of the passenger that be not religious ; would not appreciate their fate be leave in the hand of a god they do n't believe in . pilots be suppose to do checklist ; not prayer . just see from a non-religious passenger point of view . if everything seem under control ; you 're just not go fast enough ...
 i can understand that.. like when i hear something in chinese : ) one of the prophet 's companion use to hear the prophet and his companion say rhetoric supplication so he express his disappointment to the prophet that he can not say what they can say that he only ask god for paradise and seek refuge from hellfire . so the prophet tell him : around that we supplicate . prayers or supplication should n't be complicate .
 why do n't you just not fly whichever air carrier who you believe do not meet your minimum safety standard requirement ... of course that would mean that you need to personally check on each pilot and make sure he or she do not secretly place his faith on a god you do n't believe in ... actually ; i be just be diplomatic ... what i be actually say be that what you just say earlier be utter rubbish
 i suspect it be what muslims should say upon each travel . if it be that ; which i believe it be ; then here be what it say in arbic write by english follow by it translation : ( allaahu 'akbar ; allaahu 'akbar ; allaahu 'akbar ; subhaanal-lathee sakhkhara lanaa haathaa wa maa kunnaa lahu muqrineen . wa 'innaa 'ilaa rabbinaa lamunqaliboon . allaahumma 'innaa nas'aluka fee safarinaa haathal-birrawattaqwaa ; waminal-'amalimaa tardhaa ; allaahumma hawwin 'alaynaa safaranaa haathaa watwi 'annaa bu'dahu ; allaahumma 'antas-saahibu fis-safari ; walkhaleefatu fil-'ahli ; allaahumma 'innee 'a'oothu bika min wa'thaa'is-safari ; wa ka'aabanl-mandhari ; wa soo'il-munqalabi fil-maaliwal'ahli allah be the most great . allah be the most great . allah be the most great . glory be to him who have provide this for u though we could never have have it by our effort . surely ; unto our lord we be return . o allah ; we ask you on this our journey for goodness and piety ; and for work that be please to you . o allah ; lighten this journey for u and make it distance easy for u . o allah ; you be our companion on the road and the one in whose care we leave our family . o allah ; i seek refuge in you from this journey 's hardship ; and from the wicked sight in store and from find our family and property in misfortune upon returning. )
 pm : i 'm not say i would get offend . i 'm say pilot should be do checklist not prayer . people can pray all they want ; and they can leave everything in life to god ; just not when i 'm on board the aircraft . i do n't believe in god to get me down safely ; i do believe in the pilot to get me down safely . veri : it 's actually not rubbish . following link be an example where pilot have rely on god to get them down ; but he fail . maybe if they have do their job proper ; those people would n't be dead today . that 's all i 'm say . http : //thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/25/court-in-italy-convicts-pilot-who-prayed-before-crash/ as one of the reader have write in his comment to this article : `` the lord may be my shepherd ; but i dont want him a my pilot '' . if everything seem under control ; you 're just not go fast enough ...
 he say ; you have to pay during the journey to arrive safe . especially nowadays ; too many crash ! so do n't forget to pray ok !
 this happen during the prohpet 's time ; after finish a prayer ; a man get outside the mosque and do not find his camel which he leave . the man ; surprise ; say i depend on god ! ( which we should do ) and the prophet reply ; tie it and depend on god ! so i agree with those who should confirm checklist be complete and not just depend on god while the tank would run out halfway !

 it 's not record . the pilot say it after go through his checklist . it only take 10 second .
 alhumdullilah most of them be in wudu as-sunnah as saheeha http : //www.islamlecture.com/
 yes probably it 's record becasue sometimes pilot be non-muslims .
 entire journey be nothing but glorification subhanallah as-sunnah as saheeha http : //www.islamlecture.com/
 record or not ... ... why would any pilot say that in the first place . aana free ; jaana free ; pakde gaye tho khana free .
 some ppl just ca n't handle religion : )
 why do n't you guy read my post . i do n't mind when people pray . i do mind when they leave everybody 's fate in the hand of god . if you know your english ; you will understand that `` i do mind when they leave ... . '' do n't mean `` i do mind that they all leave ... '' in other word ; i 'm not say everyone be leave everything to god ; but some do and it only take one bad apple . that 's all i say . ql : i can handle religion just fine . i just ca n't handle when religious people ca n't handle the truth . veri : nope ; the one thing i can promise you i would n't do if i know we be crash ; be scream `` i believe ; i believe ... '' . i would be look for the near exit and if time permit ; i would write a letter to my family . but that 's just me ... if everything seem under control ; you 're just not go fast enough ...
 and some people just keep on argue about religion it 's not the pilot ; it 's not the crew either ... ... .it 's our tea boy..khalas..khalas..khalas..khalas..khalas..khalas..
 it mean `` allah be the great '' .. ! ~noms~ -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - `` before god we be all equally wise ' and equally foolish '' - albert einstein
 you say this ... `` i 'd rather have no prayer on board an aircraft . no matter which god you believe in ; i 'm sure ; in your book ; he 's do a great job . but ; surely the remainder of the passenger that be not religious ; would not appreciate their fate be leave in the hand of a god they do n't believe in . pilots be suppose to do checklist ; not prayer . '' and then later you say you do n't mind when people pray ... now you really have me confuse

 the poor guy be just stress with work and home ; so he go screws someone to take his mind off thing . obviously the other woman be the guilty party since she must have lead him on and seduce him.. i think that 's what she mean ...
 right now we haven`t talk seriuosly for almost 1 month ... i just really don`t know what to do . m here in the philippine and it really so unfair on my side

 i be answer qatarisun 's question . married men know where to start ; what to do ; when be time to do ; slow moving ; do n't rush ; patient ; etc in everything . single guy do n't have those experience .
 unfaithful husband if u find out that ur husband be have an affair ; will u still consider him a a faithful husband ?
 really ; bluemountain ? ? i never notice it ... : ) : ) and hey ; do you think that 's why a girl prefer a married man ? because all she need be that he know `` where to start ; what to do and how to come.. ops sorry ; to finish everything '' ? .. and i hate `` slow moving '' anyway ... it make me feel sleepy anyway.. just a next stupid thread ... < i > < b > ********************* `` what lie behind u and what lie before u be small compare to what lie within u .

 sorry . too quick off the mark there : )
 lol ; qs . i tend to believe you .
 be have an affair when she be here ; probably lot of them.. and her hubby be at home look after the kid . she meet him in church a she be so devoted to her religion and ethic . my point be that cheat be cheat ; whatever the circumstance.. you 've either get a marriage ; or you shut up about it and have a business contract .
 what ? ? ? if you do n't call him unfaithful after find out he 's have an affair ; what be he then ? ? ? a generous and love husband ? < a href= '' http : //photobucket.com/images/glitter % 20icons '' target= ''  '' > < img src= '' http : //i117.photobucket.com/albums/o74/jlb0512/icons/glitter.gif '' border= '' 0 '' alt= '' glitter pictures ; images and photos '' / > < /a > < i > life 's a bitch and then you die ! ; ) < /i >
 cheating be betrayal betrayal be murder.. dont have a forgiving heart for that kind ! `` so wag kang nega ! bixoxa ! ! ''
 it very sad reading about the number of such case in the filipino community..poor wife in home country whilst the guy have a mistress here . the embassy should help in these matters..
 faithful - truthful ; loyal ; or true ( to you ) . as for relationship break cause by be away w/ each other ; only your guilt of conscience can help you realize that . it 's a matter of choose your own destiny .
 it do n't matter if your wife tell you such . if you do n't wan na have an affair ; you just do n't . respect your wife a you respect yourself . treathening be not the cure for cheat or lie or whatever ! `` so wag kang nega ! bixoxa ! ! ''
 franelizabeth ; just for curiosity sake ; do you let her husband know ? i ask because i be in a similar situation . only it be my friend/colleague . she use to have fun while her family/husabnd think she be with me / busy in a business meeting . whenever her husband call to inquire i have to lie ( a she ask me to before leave with her bf ) . i think it was'nt my business to interfere in her private affair - but once her husband ask me directly if there be another man in her life and i have to lie . she be no more a friend but i carry a guilt because i know her husband really care for her and look after the kid in her absence .
 unfaithful husband if u find out that ur husband be have an affair ; will u still consider him a a faithful husband ?
 it 's a sad pactice to cheat on a loving partner.rajah ; .. do u spk wit ur husband on the matter ? decide to stay or leave after hear his reason [ pathetic ; though ] for the affair
 a part of conjugal right . but do n't mess with your ( filipina ) wife a you might wake up ape `` mr. bobbit '' the morning he wake out miss his twinkie ... .lol < a href= '' http : //www.glitter-graphics.com '' > < img src= '' http : //dl4.glitter-graphics.net/pub/789/789734c9hsuc4ab6.gif '' width=326 height=163 border=0 > < /a > < br > < a href= '' http : //www.glitter-works.org '' target= > < /a > < a href= '' http : //www.glitter-graphics.com '' > < i
 darling ; unfaithful be just a word ; nobody really give a important to it.men be men if they sleep with other lady it do n't mean he love her or he be ready to give up his family hey ! ! come on.. if you only look on scientific side it so simple ... men need to ejaculate once or twice a month ( if i 'm right ? ) but ; anyway ; they have to for health reason how they do it ; it up to them . for woman we do n't need because we menstrual period every month . and husband without his wife on his side be very difficult.the stress of everyday routine . sometimes you have to understand that men be not saint . a a wife you know your husband very well . woman work away from home like middle east be not look for married man because of sex experience.. they be look for `` knight in a shining armor '' shoulder to lean on . stable and good pay job ; huge bank account one who can give them what they want.easy life.extra curricular activity for free.mostly no string attach . hey ! it not the end of the world welcome to computer age.. you can do something productive than cry and feel sorry for yourself you can twist everything it all up to you.cheers
 just because he be here and you be there ; be no reason to accept his unfaithfulness . just like him ; you be alone ... have you cheat on him ? my guess be no . you have to make the decision a to what you can live with and what you ca n't . do n't just take it because he 's a man ... be a woman and have respect enough for yourself and do what be right for you and child . when he return ; have him get test for any and all sexually transmit disease before you let him back in the house because if he have them ; so will you if you let him back in your bed . if you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous ; he will not bite you ; that be the main difference between a dog and man . -mark twain-
 men do n't have to ejaculate each month ! ! who in the world fed you that line of bs ? ? ? ! ! ! there be no health reason for this `` need '' . men and woman 's sex drive be basically the same..its how it dealt with that 's different . you be give the male the excuse to go find someone to have sex with because he `` need '' to ? ? ? get real ! ! there be no biological requirement for that . and even if there be ; they can always give themselves a help hand..they do n't have to go look for a woman to have an affair with . geez ... get real.. if you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous ; he will not bite you ; that be the main difference between a dog and man . -mark twain-
 rajah it depend on how you find out ! ; be it thru your own knowledge ; or just a message from your friend ; or your relative give you that information . sometimes it be very deceive when thing come up into our mind . here be a classic sample.. the boss and the secretary.. one day the two of them drive to the hotel ; someone saw them while enter into the hotel ; after an hour ; the two leave the hotel . this witness spread the news that the two have an affair ; they go to the hotel to release their desire . ( take note the witness be n't sure what really happen inside the hotel ) the truth be ; the boss and the secretary go to the hotel to talk to the manager of how they can promote their company with the help of the hotel . for the meantime just trust your husband.. he maybe unfaithful a what they say but still he be your husband and the father to your kid . < a href= '' http : //cgi.godsview.com/cgi-bin/rcdenig/pdchap.pl ? file=3753 & occ=27 '' > rache ist bergwerk saith der lord < /a >
 sf25 ( hai how be you ? ) if he have an offer then he be a unfaithful huband only . but what be your innermost feeling would like to leave him ? and plan yourself to meet out your day to day life economically.if you be self employed take decision boldely .
 rajah ; u may cry a river over the situation ; but my dear ; u 've get ta be strong . this thing ( sadly ) happen whether he 's assign to work there or in me . u say u 've talk 2 the girl and could'nt do anything ... well u good do sumthing while u cry girl ! cry be n't always a sign of defeat ... once he come back home ; show him how faithfull you 've be oppose to what he have do ; if this wont make him realize his mistake and rectify his misdoings ; then by all mean -dejar que se vaya ; termine ! -easier say than do eh ? yes it be but if bad come to worst - why settle to an unfaithfull husband when you deserve much good ; i dont mean u get even with him by do *** let him realize what a loser he be for mess up ur family ... ! ! `` ... remember ; the shadow be just as important a the light ...

 70 % of all ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh do i have to stop at 70 % ?
 hahahaha ... i be kid ... lol ... ppl r take stuff really seriously .. and my wife be so precious to me .. weather she will take 70 % or not .. i would n't do that .. cuz i love her .. it just remind me with a joke of 2 couple be live happily and calmy for more over than 30 yrs .. ppl want to know the reason of their happiness .. the guy say in our honey moon we go for horse rid .. her horse be little bit naughty and it let her fall ... she look at the horse and she say `` this be ur 1st '' another time the horse fell her gain .. she say `` and that would be the 2nd '' in the 3rd time she pop up her gun and hit the horse in the head say `` that be ur 3rd '' so i shout at her `` what the f*** u do ; u just kill the horse '' she reply `` this be ur 1st '' after that they live so happy for how many year .. ================================================ < strong > my music : < /strong > < a href= '' http : //www.showcaseyourmusic.com/littleguitarist '' > http : //www.showcaseyourmusic.com/littleguitarist < /a > < strong > my photographing : < /strong > < a
 unfaithful husband if u find out that ur husband be have an affair ; will u still consider him a a faithful husband ?
 harry ; if you would n't consider that a unfaithfulness ; then do that mean rajah should just put a poker face ; and wait until he stop philander or hop from one woman to another ? stand up for yourself and your kid . you might lose respect for yourself . do n't ever let that happen to you .
 i think harry be be flippant.. if rajah park be silly enough to ask such a question then he/ she deserve a flippant answer.. i prsonally think that this be a troll have fun at our expense.. there have be too many similar thread from so call filipinas lately..
 thats ur opinion..for me it never silly to ask such question like this when u know that sometimes we need some advise..ur culture our culture be different when it come to marriage we don`t give up that easily.. as long a we could keep the marriage.. this thing happen to me it not a joke or what.. i just need some advise and m take my time to think rather than decide and regret later..
 my answer in no ; you hug him and give lot of love so he never do/think that mistake.only way be that think ... . `` helping hands r well than pray lips ''
 if he 's cheat on you then show him the door ... simple ... he would never accept you cheat so why should you ... and for all those `` idiot '' who be tell you it a normal thing a a guy ; i think they be talk a lot of bs ... when you marry you marry with the aim of stay together ... if you can not keep it in your pant ( guys ) or gal then separate and go your own way ... being unfaithful be something that no matter how many time you say you will forgive never happen ... it there in your mind forever and eat away at you ... ..
 there be a difference.. she be a faithful lady want to save her marriage.. he 's a low life..
 rajah park just consider yourself geographically divorce .
 i like your thinking ... .. : o )
 the question be that why he be divert to hang around with other woman ; and why the other woman like to have an affiar with him ; your qustion do not justify for one gender ; what about wife be not faithful ... . : - ) : - ) a house divided against itself can not stand :
 i hope it was't me a house divided against itself can not stand :
 unfaithful husband if u find out that ur husband be have an affair ; will u still consider him a a faithful husband ?
 i think you be just look for excuse to 'stay ' with him . ou know the answer perfectly well yourself . there be no excuse for cheat ... if you want to stay married .
 hahaha.. rajah ... u know the answer urself . i think u r not that stupid to realize by now if he be faithful or not . my next question is.. if u still trust him ? if not ; then it time for you to move on . otherwise ; ur a masochist .
 no ; do n't consider him a a faithfull husband anymore ; just think of him a a good husband who want to share his love to few other in need of attention marry woman . nice 1st comment qatarsun ; bullseye
 so that no one will answer ... nyahahahahaha well ... . nyahahahahahha again ! < b > '' bring it on dude ! ! ! `` < /b >
 why be it be generalise for philipino hubby ? are there lot of distress call by phili wife ? ? ? the other question be : have the initiator of the post clarify why she think her hubby to be unfaithful ? she just throw a casual query & people jump in to clarify ; respond ; suggest ; argue & what not ? < b > infidelity be an interesting subject no doubt ; but marriage be a personal affair ; be n't it ?
 so what 's the prob ? respect each opinion ... whether it 's good or not ... a member ; we be entitle to it unless i 'm throw nasty word ... be i right ? if not ... .it 's up to u or . . . . . . < b > '' bring it on dude ! ! ! `` < /b >
 yes ; you need to go to the immigration building # 4 ; madinah khalifa . first of all ; ask the typist ( outside building # 4 ) to type ur tourist visa extention application ; then go to build # 4 with that application and original passport . they will charge u qr 100/- for one month visa extention .
 thanks . he really need that info . he be quite afraid that he will go exit if his rp do not come out before the eid holiday . he be only issue a 30 day tourist visit .
 hello friend ; i do not think tourist visa be extendable beyond 1 month . because ; 6 month back i have arrange tourist visa for one of my relative to come to qatar through cleopatra travels . at the time of apply visa itself ; pro of travel agent have warn that it be strictly unextendable . the simple logic be if there be any chance for renewal ; the process must start from sponsor i.e . travel agent and defnitely not by u . anyway ; you may enquire at immigration at garaffa . so my advice be well not to take any risk or chance of overstay since the penalty be hefty . good luck .
 dear speedmark ; do you try it out ... please tell me also ... since mine be alos the same case with my wife..i hop that her rp could be do in this month but it willd efinitly get extend . so i be also worry about the same . any clue ?
 duration of stay for tourist visa ? help ! ! ! my friend come to qatar last 29 august use a tourist visa . he be on his way to change his tourist visa to rp but he be quite concerned that his rp may not come out before the eid holiday . they be tell that theres no work for immigration for 10 day due to eid holiday that might start next friday or saturday . how long will he be able to stay in qatar ? is there a way to extend his tourist visa ?
 dear vinith ; the travel agency that we take the tourist visit visa tell u that tourist visa can not be extend beyond 30 day of stay . they offer u to make an exit to bahrain and go back to doha for a new 30-day tourist visa . however ; we opt that to transfer his tourist visa to business visa to the company that hire him and without go out of the country . it will be easy for him to transfer from business visa to rp because his sponsor be his company .
 you would need at least qar15 ; 000.00 a month for yourself and your family but not including accomodation and transportation expense .
 i agree with te but bit more moderate and minimum can be 12000+accommodation
 12000+accomodation .
 grabe ... qatar be that expensive ? if im earn 12t a month ; i will have no saving ; all will go to waste ... from your answer an average of 10-15t for a small family to live a normal life here ? do i get the idea correctly ?
 here be lot of family stay with a salary of 4000 - 5000 ; so living cost be depend upon life style

 gatorade for kid ? my kid ( 2 yr and 9 yr ) love to drink gatorade ; i know gatorade be an energy drink ( for rehydration ) mostly for athlete ... its be safe for their age. ? ?
 what i give you now be not a wikepedia cut & paste . most of the energy drink consist of stimulants ; some of which be use a `` dope '' by the athlete . initially the drink may give you sudden outburst of energy ; but study show that such stimulant weaken the nervous system in the long run .
 gatorade do not have alcohol and be not consider an `` energy '' drink such a red bull . gatorade help to replenish electrolyte and carbohydrate that be lose when participate in physical activity . it be also a good drink to have when you have be ill to your stomach .

 where be the good place to stay qatar or dubai ? many people say that qatar be good than dubai and other might say dubai be well . i do n't really know which be right ! if you have any idea please share it . thanks
 qatar
 dubai be 2 over crowd so qatar be well
 here be my 2cent.. qatar : good to earn dubai : good to spend . dubai have a sophisticated crowd compare to qatar . ( my personal observation ) peeps there know how to dress up . ( does n't mean people here suck in that category ; you just do n't find ( or maybe rarely ) guy wear jean with different color on either side or wannabe nelly ; snoop dogg ; eminem ... dubai do n't have day such a `` family day '' in malls ; everyone be equal and when i say everyone..i mean it ! but the best part be ... .dubai 's general mind set be at least 2 decade ahead of qatar . qatar have a vision ; rapid growth ( for the good or bad ) ; and a will to succeed in whatever .
 you 've get an absolute fantastic answer above..so i wo n't comment further.. now tell u ; where be you at present ? ? if not in either of the country ; why the hell be you ask this ? ?

 it very hard to say that you can find or do your make-up le then 200 bc normaly rate be accord to the occasion.i 'm a make-up artist and my charge for model or party make-up 300qr and then go on and on so obviously saloon take more then that but hop maybe any saloon do this job so cheaply .
 it very hard to say that you can find any make-up service at this rate ; i 'm a make-up artist and my rate for model or party make-up be 350qr and then go on and on ; obviously saloon take more then that ; normaly rate be accord to the occasion so hop and also wish that you can find or do your make-up at this rate or maybe you 'll find any saloon who do this jobn at very cheep rate .
 i agree with the fact that it depend on the occassion ... but dear i can tell you something that will be a good help for you . during weekend there be usually make-up artist that come from european country who come to qatar to promote what ever brand of make-up they be sell . it usually happen at sephora ; debenhams ; highland and the like . you will be lucky if the occassion that you need to go to fall on weekend . they can do your make up for free ! well almost ... because you need to buy at least 1 of their item . but at least you get your make do by a real proffessional for a fraction of the price . hope this thought help you . good luck !
 not good
 al bayan compound use to be only for qatar petroleum employees only until recently when they have allow a certain amount of villas to be let out to outside people . generally the compound be good for the price you be pay for it . decent size swimming pool . rooms be quite big size . it have a shop etc . so on a whole for the price that they be charge it be a good deal . if you want good than you have to pay more .
 thank you ukengqatar . your input be very helpful .
 based on what i hear from friend who live there temporarily ( newly hire qp employee ) ; or rent there : pros : - it be decent for the price - location be pretty ok - villas be good size cons : - temporary accommodation for qp newly-hired ; high turnover of tenant - furniture be horrible ; old and bulky - area get very congested near saad stadium when there be a game when it come to housing ; it be relative and greatly depend on your life style and what you be use to . i would say visit a few time and see a few villa 's before you make your decision .

 my wife be under her cmpany & mine be under my cmpany and so be my daughter 's . i contract will be expire soon and i hve to exit qatar but bfore that i need to transfer my daughter 's sponsorship to my wife 's . some say i need noc letter from my cmpny that i be finish my job contract so i need to transfer my daughter 's spnsorship to my wife so that the immigration will accept the transferring .
 well if you 're carry more than 1 laptop ; i believe they will question you.. i have bring my laptop here with me and i 've get no problem at all at the airport ; consider that it be on my carry-on baggage.. someone will correct me if i 'm wrong.. have a nice day..
 1 personal laptop ( even if it box pack ; new ) be allow for every passenger in most country include qatar ; so do n't worry .
 i have travel very times with my personal notebook and till now so far no 1 say or ask anything to me but it should be one not more then that .
 no problem at all ... ..its a necessity here in qatar .
 if you bring along with you or with by someone . then nothing to pay a it 's for your personal use . it mean one person can carry one laptop while travel without any custom duty in any country except usa ( carrying laptop be forbid in usa for non us citizen ) . but if you bring through dhl/ups/fedex or any other cargo service then you should pay custom .
 as i feel one or two do not matter you can bring ; any electronic item either 3 or 5 more than this quantity they can ask for custom .
 one laptop can carry with u ... no charge al all/..

 yes ; in the mall ; which al futtaim go to construct close to qatar bahrain highway
 q : how many ikea shop assistans do it take to change a light bulb ? a : sorry ; we run out of light bulb stock . we expect it to arrive early next month . we do have ladder though ! you just go straight on ; then leave and then right .
 lucy ; what a wonderful explanation ! i be amazed ... here i be wonder why there be an ikea store in each and every me country except for qatar ... and there you be ... give me this extremely logical and clear explanation ! you really make my evening .

 oh lucy ... you really really need to get your med sort ... . ikea be not good enough for qatar ... but what about rawnaq and rameez and the junk furniture in carrefour ? ? ? maybe the sugar from you krispy kremes ... ..gave you a blood rush
 it 's not like she be serve nescafe to italians ; )
 the real reason why ikea will not be allow in qatar http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=q6xigaaprwu & feature=player #
 this a punch ... do n't mention the 'n ' word it be banned in my universe ... ..lol

 ikea be not good enough for qatar or be qatar not good enough for ikea ? ..let me work that one out . i spend a whole day in ikea last time i be in dubai.. : )

 ikea hey guy ; be ikea ever go to open here ?
 wish ikea wud come to qatar ... .wonder why it still isnt here ... ... great place to shop ... ..
 britexpat.. here in the middleast ikea do offer a deliver and pack service..hehehe.. yes last time we be in dubai . we treat 10 people with the best of swedish food for just under 250aed include the deserts.. now beat that.. : )
 that 's the point .. i usually go to ikea for the fish & chip and coffee : o )
 some just want to comment everything under the sun . the so-called know-all .
 i love the hot dog at ikea ; - )
 lucy comeon.. ikea be a huge success in dubai ; and do you think qatar be more quality concern than dubai ? lol never mate . many thing you get here be crap too
 yeah oryx ... . true so much bad quality furniture around ... . its mostly the wood that be bad ... .. and they finish it off with a wood color paper sticker ... . which kid can just peel off ...
 the sole ikea agent in the middle east be al-futaim . the reason al futaim have fail to open a branch here be purely due to logistics . unlike other furniture store in qatar ; ikea have a policy of accumulate all it item in one store ( no backup store in industrial area ) . thus ; municipality never grant them approval for a doha store .
 is n't that a bank ? hmmm ; lucy ... ... ; )

 it 's a shame we do n't go at the same time . i have give up eat meat but ca n't give up big macs so i buy one ; chuck away the meat and just eat the rest ! i love the bread ; sauce and pickle ; not fuss about the meat .
 i eat my last burger last year .
 small burger and fry ? probably an effect of world crisis : p
 maybe mac donald 's saw that it be more fit to serve a small version of big mac ; and a large version of the large soda and large fry in doha . : ) < i > mind your own business ; then see the joy come into your life .
 i hate big mac ... : p
 me too chen i hate big mac . never fan of mc donald unless be so drunk and they the only place be open . hehehhehee everybody be right everybody be wrong ; it depend where you stand

 i get mine from uk and unlock it here ; have a look in the us a well ; but could n't find one with no contract ; but it be definately cheap than buy in doha
 you can not enjoy some of the feature that be offer loacally if you buy us unit . and you may spend more of unlocking . local unit though more expensive but with warranty and guarantee you will enjoy all feature .
 i think it would be good to the buy the iphone here . you get a warranty although it a bit expensive here . and about the unlocking bit ; fear not cuz it 's a 2-minute thing .
 i would suggest to buy it from here in qatar but it 's rather expensive.. got mine at qrs 2500 . you can also buy it from the us and have it jailbroken here.. software ( for unlocking and jailbreaking ) be also available on the net ; specifically on ebay . the problem be that 3g iphones do n't have an unlocking software yet in the market.. only for 2gs ... just check first before purchasing or you 'll end up with a phone that do n't support the network . have you consider buy a nokia 5800 instead of an iphone ? : p
 ask lp his fav radio station
 as a result of your first 8 word ; i be question your credibility ... ... ... ... ... ... .
 the big fan of qbs radio
 what be wrong with my 1st 8 word ?
 how to send request song to 97.5fm qbs ? i be an avid fan of this station but when i be try to send my request song my mobile always say `` message not send this time `` i think i send it to the correct number thanks .
 you 're clearly a few sandwich short of a picnic if you 're truly an avid fan ... .in which case i 'd assume the mistake be yours !
 it 's not that it 's a terrible station just that the morning time music show be awful ! the presenter be so out of touch ! later on in the day it do get slightly well but generally i agree with dohabrit and chairboy about the op 's first 8 word !
 for god 's sake ; the guy ( or whoever it be ) just ask how to send the message.. lp ; tell him ( her ? )
 sending song request to qbs radio be for families only ... bachelor not allow .
 actually i be negotiate the salary ... mostly it will come to 14000 qar + accomadation + travel and all ... i be really confused .. in most forum in the internet have differnt opinions.. i be an indian.. this be the first time come to qatar ... thats why ask ? ? : (
 wait for some suggestion from indian i think their suggests would be helpful a from the same country ; again it all depends on your lifestyle so i guess it pretty much good to grab it .
 a person earn qr10 ; 000 be enough to survive with a family . 15 ; 000 be a very good offer .
 thanks guy ; ; ; ; @ manuprab it 14000 in hand + accomadtion+ travel ... . thanks for the suggestion.. will come there by january 2013
 1000 qr more than enough ; if you have a lovable wife
 it depend on your lifestyle . if both of you and your wife be shop addict then it 's not a sufficient amount .
 15000 qar + transport + housing be enough ? 14000 qar + transport + housing + medical + travel benefit be enough ? to survive and save money with living in normal lifestyle for a couple and kid ( just one yr old0
 considering you get housing ; yes you can survive . whether it be a good salary give your qualification ; experience and current earnings - no clue ; cause we do n't know the same .
 this be good package . house rent : maximam 5000qr be 2 bedroom flat + food expense -maximam 1500month . telephone cost maximam- 2000qr/month . then you can calculate .
 that 's more than enough not unless you eat gold for every meal
 thanks everyone for their opinion ... . i be join a business analyst over there ... i have 6 yr experience ... .. in india ...
 dont think much
 i so like qatar3040 's calculation ; food 1500 fone 2000 lol do you spend time on fone more than you eat ? i have 2 fones ; one shahry and one hala ; i spend more than 600 minute per month + international + bb service and my bill never go more than 350/-qr
 he 's not use viber that 's why his fone budget be qr2 ; 000/month .
 so the food be good : ) how expensive be expensive ? for a 3 course meal ?
 not that impress ; overprice - the concept be apparently upmarket pub grub but at michelin star price . usual stroy in qatar - let u rip the expat off who be so stupid a to go there . his michelin star french food restaurant in claridges in london be not as expensive a the bloody burger you get . better food to be have elsewhere in town . another note ; like most food outlet on the pearl ; expect to be rip off ; over price and bad . except carluccios which be ok .
 i understand ; it chef ramsey it suppose to be expensive ; but how expensive be expensive be the question
 maze ? chef ramsey has anyone be to that restraunt on the pearl own by chef ramsey ?
 depends if you be drink wine ; if so ; meal for 2 no less than 1000qar carluccios be a lot cheap if not quite so fancy
 perhaps 800 then - all depend what you order to be honest .
 be you talk about just for yourself or a meal with your wife and baby ; which you do n't want any part of ? : (
 just myself and my wife ; and the baby can sit at home .
 i understand that his discount lunch menu be probably the best deal to be have at maze - but who want to wing it all the way obver to the pearl for lunch ... i guess business people with an eye on create an impresion will .
 it still pant
 lol colt !
 when they say a restaurant be run by celebrity chef gordan ramsey ; you at least expect fabulous . well ; it not ! although the staff be charm & cheerful ; there be nothing amaze about the place . read more : http : //www.qatarliving.com/reviews/restaurants/french/gordon-ramseys-maze # ixzz1bkg3adlk

 thanks bleu for the genuine answer
 brightsun ; this be mostly about new contract ; what they would do with salary be uncertain ...
 possibly to do with the contractor not get pay .
 ca n't remember if this from an article in the newspaper or from a forum here ; but a i recall there be some substantial sum of money that be in dispute . could you imagine how much easy it would be to get around town ; and how much fast if that section of road would be finish !
 i talk to the man tht be sit there i ask him he say worker not getiing pay
 if i be not mistake that project be more than 5 year now ... as far a i know ; they start work that project way back 2004 and still not yet finish . i presume there be a long long way to finish this project since it be completely stopped ang long overdue .
 freeway ply over does anyone knoes what be go on on the freeway constraction of the fly over on al rayan road ? . i have not see anybody work for quit some time . everyting be just stop .
 doha expressway project original completion date be sept 2008 . it be push back to sept 2009 but now the payment dispute between ashagal and the contractor have put it on hold indefinately . it be a terrible shame and i hope the qatari citizen voice their displeasure loudly enough to get the problem solve quickly . the official in charge should be hold accountable .
 sept 1 ; 2010 to may 2011 ?
 non applicable for none qataris
 seek help from labor office to know your legal right as well a your entitlement .
 i be not work during the time ; but i be tell company will give me change at sept 2011 itself . but they delay it for 8 month . whats ur point of view ?
 did you work for them between sept 10 till may 11 ? i mean ; actually go to the place and work every week ?
 you can go to musherib street where sofitel be ; along that stretch ; u will find pretty good printer shop charge good price bro .
 go to mushreeb near by sofitel hotel there be shop name copy center ; they do with best quality and good price . < br / > < img src= '' http : //img.webme.com/pic/s/sonamz007/nepal '' / > < br / > nepal < br >
 and i need them so badly that i pay it !
 yes u can take [ temp ] licence here ... contact with near by drive school ...
 can an indian on a business visa get a driving license ? i 'm get tire of spend truck load on taxi . is there any way i could get a temporary license ( or any other license ) in qatar .
 permenent drive licence need id number which give to rp holder.business visa be short term visa and you can drive on temp licence .
 thanks guy ... and how much would a temp license cost and how long would it take to get one ?
 i doubt whether you get insurance protection with temporary licence . this be very important in the unfortunate event of any accident . pls check it out with traffic/insurance companies..
 < a > < strong > all company would look at experience ; education ; but they would n't hire people just to hire them . they would need an `` open position '' ; and they would want to evaluate many people who 's cv match the requirement ; and choose one person to fill that position . the company will post the job on their website just a a formality but finally these job will be fill with less competent guy who be the relatives/friends of those cunning guy in the same organistion . this be true in the case of company like qatar petroleum etc . for example ; sap recruitment process in qp now be 100 percent illegal a many qualified guy be not consider even for the initial phase of interview so a to reserve the post for the lucky relatives/friends of those cunning guy in qp . good luck ! < /strong > < /a > < strong > < /strong > < br class= '' clear '' > < a href= '' http : //tinypic.com '' target= ''  '' > < img src= '' http : //i36.tinypic.com/2rcyhwg.jpg '' border= '' 0 '' alt= '' image and video hosting
 well if thats the case then they should n't post at all and they should n't interview people and give false assurance ... a week ago i apply with qatar airway and until now no sign of approval or at least rejection ...
 agree with dracula . if u r a qualified person then your chance be very less and for those who doesnt reach that qualification point get the 1st priority .
 atleast you have the chance when you apply ... you 'll never know what happen next ... `` just say something ... ''
 lol tb ... : p
 as long a you have noc ... you can change as much a you want ... i personally have change 6 time ... . and i know a friend who have change 11 time ... . so as long a you pay for the fee ... there 's no problem and of course you should have a clean record in the cid good luck
 if you get noc from employer u can change end number of time . incase if you be look for transfer than minimum you have to complete one year of service with every employer . the difference in transfer an noc be complete different in tranfer you do not need to go back for medical ; or exit the country it can be do locally.whereas in case of noc you have to exit the country and comeback on fresh visa ; do the medical ; fingerprint and so on best of luck regards felix
 how many time can i change sponsor how many time can apoerson change their sponsorship in qatar
 hi felix ; one of the man power recruit company be ready to give me a foreman visa.but on condition that they wont give job or salary ( mutual understanding ) .the purpose of take visa be to live with my spouse work here in doha.my doubt be that i can work for any other firm on this visa during the first year. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? the sponsor company be least bother about this ( but they tell me that if any authority find this then i will be fin ) .on completion of one year the sponsoring company will give me noc ( without change of sponsorship/transfer ) to work with other firms.and on completion of second year ( ; they tell me ; ) they will give me transfer . the above mention be my story.could you tell me the legal aspect of the above say situation ? can i work during the first year for any firm other than the sponsor company if they have no problem .
 diyarose ... to answer your question ; yes some company do accept work for them on different sponsorship ... send me a message on your qualification ; since i might have a part time job for you at my company ... . all the best
 sambsk sir ; thank you for your kindness to offer a job for me.i be post graduate ( mba-finance and marketing ) .could you please send me your email id ? so that i can send you my resume .
 what to do ... too much indians here =p
 relative dude ...
 `` sold out '' ? ? where be they play it ; in a taxi ? ? the game have all the attraction of a weekend in brisbane !
 let the stadium be full for others to see a qatar be host wc 2022 .
 all the ticket be 'sold out ' before the aus india match but the stadium be not full . i think the ticket be be buy by : 1 . companies/corporations a complimentary 2. ticket tout who hope to make a profit at the gate 3 . indians ... .there be a lot of indians here and they be good supporter !
 there be no sold-out match ! all the game be hold in front of a few spectator ! no stadium be fill !
 oryx ... i think it 1.companies/corporations a complimentary . if it be 3 genuine fan buy the ticket then it would have be great . but it not and thats sad : (
 india v/s bahrain match sold out ? - wtf india v/s bahrain football match on 14 jan 2010 - sold out ? - wtf
 tell that to lp ; oryx
 yeah ; i hear the same about ticket tout too . : o (
 damn ! ! does anyone have a some of these `` coporate contact '' with ticket for the ind-bah match ? ? could use 2 ticket ... for real !
 and i be among those who have buy the ticket for 14th jan.. : ) )
 i get my ticket too ; right next to the pitch at centre line : )
 wk ; see u there ... : ) )
 i be also seek 6 ticket of ind-bah match on 14th ; if not ; only one ( for me ) will do : ) -
 how many karala player in indian team ?
 jack in joke mooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood : p
 sold out ? i think sale be a transaction between cummodity/service and money ! ! ! ! ! th be give free ; )
 india v/s bahrain match sold out ? - wtf india v/s bahrain football match on 14 jan 2010 - sold out ? - wtf
 jacky ; dont make wrong assumption ! i m what i m !
 flan yes the one game where i be to run into you have to be australia vs india : ( sad that i be go to miss australia v korea tomorrow but have to go and support india : )
 @ flan ; that 's qatar for you ; they `` give away '' load of ticket to `` vips '' who probably ca n't spell football & be obviously not come to the game ; those ticket will lie somewhere & get throw away with the trash next week but give them to genuine fan who want to watch the game ? noooooo ... qfa have reverse it 's decision to give the icc ticket to sell to indian fan because they claim that a large % of the ticket be be sell in `` black '' i.e people be buy up ticket & then sell them around town @ a high price ... so restrict the number of ticket sell per individual ; that should severely restrict if not completely prevent the black marketing ... it 's not bloody rocket science ...
 for the cricket match in mohali stadium next to my home in india they do n't issue more than 4 or 5 ticket per person during odi game . helps to curb black marketing .
 there be also an instance where someone be try to make a name for himself by try to send student from different indian school under his school name .
 1111 points ! ! ! what a great achievement for me ! ! : p 1111 point in over a year ! !

 hello ; band 6 grade for a hsbc bank employee be also good enough for a person with a bachelor 's degree as well a a financial banking diploma with relevant work experience ; i mean at the financial service . salaries be pay accord to the industry situation and of course position offer ; what position they offer you ?
 it be still at negotiation level for relation manager.. not know if it be good and at what range should someone negotiate.. any more detail would be helpful..
 no qatar82 i do not work for hsbc but if you really want figure ; for a relation manager ; you could expect a salary of 15 ; 000-20 ; 000 ; you could negotiate for a high pay if you have good work experience ! i have work in the financial service for a long time so i have some idea .
 personally ; in qatar ; auto . there be so many idiot around that it be much easy to concentrate fully on the road ; rather than the gear . there be also not alot of 'smooth ' driving in doha ; lot of stop ; start ; stop at traffic signal ; so automatic save all that '1st gear ; neautral ' arm-work . just my opinion !
 due to traffic congestion ; preference for automatic gear . if you buy new vehicle ; then go for automatic gear vehicle . manual gear vehcile be go away from the current market .
 it be preferable to go for automatic for ease of drive and good focus on road to reach your destination ... ... ... ... ... more importantly traffic be grow in gcc and if u intend to drive down to dubai ... ... ... ... ..than good have automatic car to ease ur tension and stress building on road ... ... ... ... ... ..
 manual or automatic which car be well manual or automatic ?
 for girl : automatic for boy : automatic be well bt still manual be ok
 t coffee or me ; in what mall can i find gnc ? sure i hear of it but not exactly sure where their store located..thanks ! !

 i believe the money exchange at city center ( across from carrefour ) have western union .
 yeah ; here 's the one at city center ; qatar uae exchange city center branch level n 1 shop n 66 doha ; 31645 +974 -- 4115031 for more ; google western union doha . i get almost 50 result !
 no ; i 'm not look for western union here unless you know that they can provide money order ( i do n't think they do ) . i 'm look to get a money order ; where can i get one ?
 does anyone know where to get a money order ? in the us you can get them at bank and almost any store or western union . where can i get one here in qatar ? i do not want to transfer money but i need to send a check and a personal check wo n't work .
 hi ! there be trust exchange ; in national ; there be eastern exchange near q tel signal in musheirib ; then there in also habib qatar exchange ; in the national area . you can go to any of this exchange and transfer you money .
 money order can be obtain in post office . try visit one and inquire .
 depends on where u want to send money ; most exchange will give a certified cheque drawn on a bank in the receiving country a low rate ; most indians seem to send their money this way ; cost only a few riyal rather than the 30 riyal my exchange charge or the much high western union rate . i have use it to issue cheque in the uk and the eurozone much cheap than a telegraphic transfer but u have the postal delay and have to wait for the cheque to clear . go to a good exchange ; they may have an account the country ure interested in . above all do n't send your money thru the bank a their rate be high . try the post office as well and make ur choice good luck
 turkey to most country issue visa at the airport upon arrival . but if egypt be one of those country i do n't know . better call the turkish embassy here in doha . turkish embassy in doha postal address : dafna- al istiqlal street doha- qatar p.o . box : 1977 telephone : +974 44 95 13 00 fax : +974 44 95 13 20 e-mail : tcdohabe @ qatar.net.qa working hours : sunday - thursday 09:00 -12:00

 32bit operating system only use only upto 3 gb ram and 3 gb be enough ... ... ..and please dont give extra burden of heavy game it will surely damage ur graphic card ... bcuz these be not game console and it true that there be no update available more then 3gb ram for it which will boost it speed ... also use windows 7 ultimate in best performance mode

 btw what be raptop bcchoo ? back to topic.. gaming : ? you need dedicate 1gb gpu ; 4 to 8 ; 16 gb of ram processor : core2duo will be fine ; but recommend i7 preferably with ( thunderbolt ) . note : os with 32-bit will suffer nowadays . i.e . if you be use cs5 ( photoshop ) it will cry out loud . os : 64-bit be recommend . as for your lg core2duo change the os window 7 and if you be in 64-bit os boost it to 6gb minimum . you will enjoy performance . note : boost the maximum ram will experience high temperature of your pc and it normal . good luck

 western union
 remittance dear all which be the best way to send money from doha to home country ? regards naeem khan
 ubl near ( old al ghanim ) cornich be the best option for pakistanies
 if you have icici bank account in india from any of your family member ; then you can send it through gulf exchange near al fardan . gulf exchange will charge you qar.15/- transaction and it will get credit in 12 working hour ; mean if you deposit in morning ; icici account in india will be get credit by even and also they pay a good exchange rate compare to other exchange in doha . the only you need for this be icici bank account number ; name of the account holder ; branch ; and amount . this service be know a instant transfer ; you can check or ask about icici transfer on indian counter available in gulf exchange . i prefer this be the safe way compare to western union ; amount ger directly credit in indian bank account also high rupee value compare to western union .
 your home country be ? if pakistan ; preferred ubl ; if india ; use doha bank online remt serv .
 thank you all ; altought i forget to mention my nationality ; but i get the answer ; by the way i m pakistani . regards naeem khan

 i hear that they change facebook and it suck . what suck about it ? ? motherhood ... the hard job you 'll ever love ! : )
 well in my opinion ; both be good ... . facebook have get more popular over the month and even hit headline ... . my space be the same to back then ... . it be just a popular just a cool ... . but i stick to the facebook profile since it have load of game and information ... .and be still developin
 go ahead and open up a facebook ... it 's easy and it 's free ... i do n't really see a reason not to . keep in mind though that it 's start to die off ... within 18 month it 's gon na be as popular a icq and something else will come in it 's place .
 so if i open up a facebook account ; if i do n't like it ; can i delete my profile ? i be just wary of it since you ca n't check it out without sign up . motherhood ... the hard job you 'll ever love ! : )
 yeah definitely ... some people be also a little worried over how their information will be use and stuff but that 's all just good old paranoia . open one up ; check it out ; and if you do n't like it then deactivate ; it 'll be a if you never sign up in the first place : )
 cool ; then i 'll check it out . thanks for the input ! motherhood ... the hard job you 'll ever love ! : )
 thanks notfromhere ; do n't even cross my mind to search for facebook on ql . it would seem to me that if they be a good website you would get to check it out without sign up . usually that procedure get you into trouble . thanks again for the tip ! motherhood ... the hard job you 'll ever love ! : )
 nfh ... the only personal info you get plaster all over the internet be the info you provide . facebook can not find out anything about you that you do n't tell it ... there be no spyware in it that follow you around to other site and see what kind of person you be from other internet activity ... the whole mess about personal information abuse be that it be go to be use a a statistic tool for marketing purpose if you 're uncomfortable with share some stuff then do n't ! facebook do n't require any real information from you ... the fact that you can open a fake account prove that facebook be not out there to get you and your personal information though ; if it be that kinda site it would be much much hard to open a fake account .
 facebook be good .i have a facebook account i just close it bcos i just get addicted .lot ot of time which u can use for many other purpose be waste .. but in ql we get lot of information
 opinions on facebook can anybody give me their opinion on facebook . i be think about set up an account ; but it wo n't let you check out profile unless you sign up ; unlike myspace which let you look around before you sign up . is facebook good than myspace or the other way around ?
 its all about taste ... : p facebook on my taste be well that myspace : ) on the move ...
 even if you de-activate your account it be always there ... that be one thing with facebook you can never ever really get rid of the account ... you de-activate and the minute you wan na go back you just log in and it up and running again . i personally do not like it ... .but thats my opinion ... .
 maybe you can bring this cute one . i have see many here . you just have to comply on some requirement of bring one here ; get some permit and you should have with you his/her birth certificate .
 would you happen to know which requirement i need to comply ? and which permit i need to get ?
 contact qatar pet travel ... .they have a good website and will let you know all the detail
 yes ; just try contact qatar pet travel . i understand your desire of bring your dane with you . my daughter like your age be also keep another kind ; so adorable and sweet . try search of possibility of bring her in .
 up to last year big dog be not allowed.. but thing be obviously change ... as oryx suggest ; contact qatar pet travel .
 i be actualy consider to drive to qatar with the dog . it will be a lot cheap and it will be an amazing experience ! i just think that the great dane might have be on the 'ban-list ' in qatar ? but i will try to contact the pet travel company to hear their say
 how would you drive here ? you ; a a female ; be not allow to drive in saudi arabia . i do n't know where you 're come from but if ; for example ; you 're come from uae - you would need the proper document issue by the uae authorities/vets ; probably document allow you to import/transit an animal via saudi ( if a man be do the driving and if you be marry to him ; his sister ; or his daughter or his mother ) and then more docs to allow the dog to enter qatar . if you 're come from further afield and have more country to pass through ; it get even more complicate on the document side . i suspect nearly all of these country would require a vet inspection by their vet before allow the dog entry/transit through their country
 and i will of course make sure that the dog be fully vaccinate and have all it 's document in order - and that go for every country we will transit . also ; i would have my stepfather come and pick me up in saudi ; a woman be not allow to drive there . when i be last in doha ; i be tell that bring a great dane be illegal and impossible ; but now i see that they be only restrict ; so i guess i have all my question answer . luckily my family live in a big house with a nice garden with the lagoona in the backyard ; so apart from the heat ; the dog would n't get it any good . : )
 bring great dane ? hi everyone . i have be in doha for 5 month ; but have to go home . now i be want to come back ; but i would like to bring my dog with me . it be a great dane.. be i even allow to bring him ?
 saudi may not recognize your step father a your step father . you should check that out before make any firm plan .
 oh.. maybe you be right . he be also my sponsor in qatar - do you think that would be enough ?
 life be just like mathematics i.e . add your friend ; subtract your enemy ; multiply your job and divide your joy.. http : //www.amirafoods.com/index/safetypolicy

 from the web ... should tire be assign a shelf life ; like grocery ; milk or egg ? a safety research group say age tire develop crack or weaken when they sit around unused . tire maker in britain have just issue a warning to consumer . replace tire that be more than ten year old ; even if the tread not wear . and for a tire that hasnt be use ; like a spare ; replace it after six year . reviewing u.s. lawsuit ; the research group say that many accident involve old tire . according to strategic safety expert sean kane ; weve be able to document in a very short period of time at least 20 case involve serious injury and fatality in the united states ; and weve only scratch the surface of this issue here . ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! but read this one : shelf life not the answer but the u.s. tire industry say a shelf life be not the answer . donald shea of the rubber manufacturers association say : what it be be a complex series of event that can make a tire deteriorate . one ; be the amount of mileage ; two be the abuse it take on the road ; third and perhaps most important be the maintenance that be give or not give to the tire . if the public get the impression that they could continue to use a tire until that use by date that could send clearly the wrong message . when the nhtsa propose an upgrade to new tire standard it also propose an age standard . that be defer for two year because no one could agree on a reliable test that could artificially age a tire . the nhtsa be in the process of determine which test be best and hope to have research do by next summer . < ! -- break -- >
 you can check manufacture date from the stamp on the side of tire . stamp show the week and the year tire be manufacture . look for 4 digit number inside rounded rectangle . for example ; if you see 4007 it mean tire be manufacture on the 40th week of 2007 . similarly if it show 1208 it be manufacture on the 12th week ( early march ) of 2008 .
 not yet ; wait until after eid hoilday or beginning of 2009 ; they be about to leave the ban soon .

 we pay high rent but no tax
 only if you 're an american ( and that would be to the us ; not qatar )
 tax applicable in qatar for non qatari establishments mean other than qatar national they have to pay tax . in an expatrate employee be not require to pay tax . but his employer be liable to pay tax if it be not qatari

 food price complaint can any one please give me the detail of the goverment department for complain the high food price of some food item in a hotel compare to other hotel for the same item.it be find to be very heigh than the reasonable price of the item .
 i think that be not a reason to complain ... the hotel be manage the price for the food accord to their standard ... it 's not like the alcohol ...
 babe ; there be a telephone no . such a 180 to ask which department you can comlplain . otherwise ; the gate of emiri diwan be open for your concern . or ; try the bakala ; he selld definitely cheap than hotel : - )
 you can go to the hotel provide cheap option
 do you know who own the hotel ? i do n't think you complaint will get very far . plus hotel be not consider a basic requirement of human life . they try to regulate basic food stuff at supermarket but not hotel .
 i do n't think food in hotel can be class a essential . therefore nothing to complain about . only essential food be govern here .
 the complain be not worth it.. brain please
 do you buy food item from hotel and cook in your house . when do that start .
 google and you 'll find some shipping company . they do n't come cheap . they all have a minimum weight that you 've to pay for ; whether or not your stuff weight that much . and you must select it to be ship via sea . usually reach doha in about 30 day . this be relatively cheap way to transport item in excess of 200 lb to qatar .
 how many box and from where in the states ? just ship out of fl with a 20 ' container ; so i may be able to guide you a little .
 try aramex or dhl ... even ups work ... or tnt ...
 what be the best way of shipping of box to qatar from usa ? i will be move to qatar soon from unted states and would like to see what be the best way of ship my belonging there . thanks
 over and no ! wow this question keep pop up constantly . the simple truth be leave your stuff there a you be not move here permanently ! the money and time you spend ship item here and back will be the price of the item . do n't waste your time and do n't be so attached to inanimate object . prices here be reasonable enough that you can get a tv and electronics for almost the same a at home . washers and dryer be actually cheap - almost half the cost . believe it or not quality mattress be half the price as well - show you how much you be gouge in the us . furniture be cheap and will last the time you live here . it 's disposable furniture ; replace every 5 year ... count on spend 10 percent of the first year 's salary on air cleaner ; dryer ; dishwasher if not supply and you 'll be fine . you can sell everything for half price to co-worker or on qatar living classified area and you 'll be ahead of the game . buy your furniture here at homes r us and electronics at carrefour ; giant store or lulu and you 'll be comfortable . it will cost you money to ship or to buy so just buy . simple a that .
 probably best not . some local take offence and call the police .
 i agree with the above comment . i take my dog at the corniche some time ago . not so good reaction from some conservatives.however ; some local and their child love play with him . = ) anyhow ; i end carry him just to avoid any negative comments/complaints from the crowd there
 good away from any one ; ; do not bring him or her ; ; ; ; ; ; to park..there be many place to go .
 thanks for the replies.. can you please suggest where can i bring my dog for a nice walk ? someone mention private park : where can i find one here in doha ? i 'm new to doha !

 you need permission from the qatar government in order for a qatari to marry a non-qatari . in the case of qataris marry foreigner it be certainly not automatically grant . it be illegal to marry outside of qatar without government permission as well . mandi

 they sell all of those group of drug in the pharmacy ; some you will need a local prescription for ( available from a primary health doctor or specialist ) but usually just buy over the counter . you be require to carry a medical certificate or copy of prescription when enter qatar in case you get check but as long a you be just take the medication for yourself and not try to import it for others you will be ok . receiving medication of any kind by post be an absolute no . it be illegal and anything medicinal will be keep by custom ( include a face mask i order from elemis but i do get it back . )
 you 'll need a prescription for it . you can bring it in but make sure you have a note from your doctor say that he prescribe it for you

 better to bring your one ; here it expensive ...
 nice bike with gear and stuff cost more then 1100 qar ... ..
 nothing here ( no thing ; not one single thing ) here be logically price . all retail deal with the thing on the basis of you be in qatar . you 're highly pay ; you have to pay more ! ! !
 the price of nice cycle be 200 $ if you will pay extra weight jjust buy one from carefoure

 aspire gym fee ? ive be look to sign up for a gym after ramadan . and i be wonder if anyone here know how much they charge at aspire gym ( woman 's section ) .
 150 qr per month . mandi
 wow ! that 's not too bad at all : o )
 if you sign up for nine month it 's even less . and they offer over 130 class per week . mandi
 check your inboxx plzzx..
 the 150 qar per month mention by a previous poster be the 'add-on ' price for use the gym . you have to also have pay for membership ; which be 200 qar per month . so ; it work out at 350 per month . i be there this morning making enquiry . they be not accept any new member until after ramadan . membership begin at the first of the month ; so that mean new member will be accept from 1st october . you can attend a class without be a member . there 's a charge of 50 qar per class . you ca n't do this with the gym though . they have spin ; pilate ; circuit training ; yoga ; etc . they also do guide tour of the facility on monday ; but these wo n't resume until after ramadan . hope this help .
 mozzie ; do you know what day be pilates class ?
 it very inconvenient and very expensive ... and they have no sense of customer satisfaction . i buy a membership and now during ramadan the swimming be at 9:30 at night ! ! who make these stupid decision ! !
 it be permissible to swim during the day in ramadaan . muslims rinse thier mouth with water before prayer during fast . there be not a single hadeeth that advice otherwise unless you 're make this up ; )
 not make it up genesis . and to make matter bad ; when i be live at ezdan the pool always mysteriously close for cleaning during ramadan ; so of course that just add fuel to my thought ... haha
 aspire active be a governmental sport institute meant for the local community in the first place . it 's expect that the timing be adjust during ramadan to suit all . you can always join a hotel gym ; you know ; )
 aspire gym fee ? ive be look to sign up for a gym after ramadan . and i be wonder if anyone here know how much they charge at aspire gym ( woman 's section ) .
 include ? or rather exclude . ... and i do n't think people actually drink pool water ... . just show how far and illogical this be all taken..
 hi ; the detail of all the woman 's class at aspire active can be find here : http : //www.aspire.qa/inthecommunity/aspireactivewomen.aspx
 at teyseer on the airport road behind the suzuki showroom ; there be a car polishing shop ; philipinos ; they do a reall good job ; but quiet high ; about a year and a half ago it be aroung 800/- riyal ... not sure now
 al rasheed car wash in salwa - not much expensive and staff be good in detail . good luck ! !
 try `` al yal '' locate near the mall roundabout inside gasoline station ...
 al wesam petrol station in salwa road
 try `` shabaan '' behind giant at sana roundabout . be prepare to leave your car for a couple of hour !

 approximately 6.5 billion type of love .
 an emotion ; a relation or a situation ca n't be prefix with word love ? it be sex ( kamasutra ) you need ; you be tough/stubborn ( situation ) ; you have brother/parents/puppy/soulmate/self ( relation ) . try and define love
 different form of love how many type of love exist in this planet and which be the best form ?
 you ca n't 'define ' love . define mean to draw border . love have no border .
 type of love be only one a it generate from heart . and when it transform from heart through the mean of positive emotion ; regard ; and affection upto the mind ; then different form of love create in love-factory of planet . so ; that depend upon the best taste of your brain .
 thats why i say try
 love come in different type and shape at ramada park lot after 9pm .
 love be something people can not fathom .
 love be like a chewing gum ... you can go on chew it . the taste vanishes ... but not the gum ... lol
 there be also puppy love ... .
 love be like a cigarette it start with a flame it continue in smoke and it end in a few ash
 and we all know mens version of love for puppy lol love ca n't be define - it be such a powerful emotion .
 'they ' be indeed but you love u anyway : - )
 different form of love how many type of love exist in this planet and which be the best form ?
 no one have same fingerprint and that exact rule applies in love as well : ) ma form of love be the best : )
 ql 's stars karaoke - 21 april 2011 http : //www.qatarliving.com/node/1768948
 well you sure can find a few or else always get togather with friend to have something to help you pass your time out here . welcome n good luck out here
 ktvs like in singapore do n't exist here . karaoke bars/places like anywhere else in the world do n't exist here either . better to find a friend with a karaoke machine and bar fridge .
 some filipino restaurant have a karaoke setup ( conina filipina ; royal restaurant ; puerto galera to name a few ) . the close ktv setup would be filipino cultural center in matar kadeem . it a resto hang-out place that sometimes live band would play . they also have room with karaoke that would cater to small group for party .
 fusion restaurant ... and i hear this ffc offer them too ...
 you can get karaoke machine in several shop here in qatar with plenty of song in a disc included..
 the english language . obviously they do n't speak french here .
 qdc ... ... .used to be run by british company before qatar airways take it over ... .. plus all the brits that be still here ...
 the also left britexpat on ql : (
 what be leave of the british empire in qatar ? i see the remnant of the ottoman empire in some of the remain fort ; but what about the british empire ? any sit or influence on qatar and qatari culture today that you see ?
 are you kid ? this place still is still part of the anglo empire ( now be run by the americans rather than the brits but still anglo ) . favorite sport : english football/soccer . huge effort to get the wc 2022 here . language : more people speak english than arabic in qatar . primary/secondary education : british curriculum ( or version of it ) prevail and be most sought universities : colony of american university economy : petroleum product extract by mostly american company ; distribute by mostly american company and use to fuel anglo empire and other economy . professional class : lot of brits and other anglos manage everything from bank to education to infrastructure shopping : mall be american look-a-likes pack with shop that be all over anglo world . whole concept of mass shopping like this indoors be american . health : people get obese just like in other part of the anglo empire a they feast on burger ; chicken nugget ; fry and coke . defense : mostly-american make weapon and a big us military presence politics : considered a close ally of britain ; us and other part of the anglo empire . cars : the favorite land cruiser be make in toyota 's american factory . dress : blue jean ( american ) and business suit ( english ) prevail . a gap in every mall . i be not say this be good or bad . it simply be ; and personally have no problem with it .
 ok i might be wrong ; but be it not the british who endorse the current ruling family in qatar ?
 britain be not a big influence when it be a protectorate ; but a olympics write ; a much large influence afterwards and indirectly ( via other part of the old empire ) . i suppose it all depend on how you interpret empire .
 the three pin electrical socket be british and most of the standard use him from finance to construction be british standards .
 cabbage ; all the qataris in my office speak english ; a english be the working language ; with a exception of few official letter in arabic everything else be communicate and adminstered in english . arein english may be the second most language speak in qatar not after arabic but after malayalam ? : )
 i always use bin yousef cargo - they send it via qatar airways cargo . it 's quick and about as cheap a you 'll get . i ca n't remember the cost structure but i do remember compare about 3 company and they be the best .
 i agree with boer ; i have use bin yousef after compare price and be very happy with their service and cost . 44074777

 there be several consideration in buy laptop and here be some of the basics.. looks - definitely you want to have a laptop which can be mistakenly recognize a an old one ; so you have to select which be the most updated and stylish in term of appearance . right now ; most laptop be get thinner compare to their predecessor . also ; a laptop which be small in term of screen width ( 14 inch below ) be so stylish and more handy . any brand of laptop can be as stylish a be seem depend on your taste . battery life - this be also a major consideration in buy laptop . it also create a lot of inconvenience if your laptop battery last for short period only . in my experience hp laptop battery be far well from any brand . just always remember that when you be charge your battery ; unplug the cable once it be fully charge . if you be go to use your laptop for a long period of time ; it 's good if you plug the laptop to a regulated power supply and detach your battery from the laptop . the first two be basic consideration . below point be dependent on your application the laptop shall be subject once it be in operation . applications be graphic design ; web-designs ; software ; chat ; game ; audio and video ; email and web-browsing ; etc . processor - buy laptop with a minimum of 2.0 ghz speed for good output of your application . graphics - if you want good graphic ; select a laptop with g-force in it . operating system - vista and it predecessor ; xp be really far from each other . although all new laptop be basically equip with vista os ; try on have two os 's like xp on one drive and vista on the other ( dualboot ) ; so you can be more flexible . ram and hdd - random access memory ( ram ) and hard disk drive ( hdd ) be also to be consider if you want high application . anyway laptops right now be arrive at 2gb ram and 250 hdd at minimum . hope i 'd help you on select a laptop . basically ; we can not really say what laptop be the best ; it depend on your preferred application usage .
 many thanks to all specially to lyndon . i suppose to buy dell xps 1530 .
 which be laptop be good ? i would like to buy a laptop for my personal use . any suggestion which brand of laptop be good . i need a good quality and good brand ? dell ; toshiba ; hp ? ? ? ? ?

 i still rememeber massive traffic jams at sport r/a ; mall r/a ; tv r/a ban spoon feeding not me
 believe me this be the only way to reduce accident

 the best route be not economic ; doh-jfk or aud or iah direct ( business class ) ; then a local flight to atl .

 do you want iphone make in euthopia ?
 i think he 's refer to the replica ; not the original one . i 've see them in dubai ( in the huge dragon mall near international city ) . it 's not really an iphone ; although it look like one . chinese go creative with those and add few feature ; like some of them take 2 sim card ; and i saw one that 's actually small . they 're also much cheap ( ~300-500 qr ) . screen resolution ; software ; etc be do n't compare to the real iphone . if you 're plan to buy one to convince yourself that you have an iphone ; then do n't ; because it wo n't work . otherwise it might be worth consider .

 nothing.. will get what write in your intial contract !

 in govt. ? it will take a miracle ! ! !
 thanks for your comment . the reason i ask the question be that in western country usually ; the trend be that private company estimate the annual pay increase of their staff by look at government 's pay increase . for example ; if the government increase the salary by 3 % ; they may increase by 4-5 % . i work for a private company ; in my contract ; it say the company will review the pay each year . hopefully it mean that it will only go up : - ) so i want to get an idea of how much it will go up by ? cheers

 no this be illegal . one should request the passport and if not give you can go to embassy or police . passport be property of the country issue and illegal to be hold back other by a government authority like police for valid reasons.. ( but not a company )
 your passport should be with you and not with your company .
 illegal - a your passport be actually the property of your government

 is it legal in qatar for a company to hold an employee passport ? is it legal in qatar for a company to hold an employee passport ? it be buy to my attention that a company be in control of employee passport . i do not know the law regard this but it do not sound a if it be fair to me . does anyone know if this be allow ?
 it be illegal but normal in qatar !
 it doesnt make a difference since you can not leave the country without an exit permit
 it might seem illegal but the passport do n't serve it purpose even if it 's in your hand . should you need to exit or leave the country ; your company still need it in order to arrange for an exit permit . also ; it 's good to let your company have it for safekeeping . there have be lot of story or even appeal in the daily paper of people who have lose their passport while it be in their possession . in our company ; passport be store in a fire-proof safe . the staff have the option of either keep the passport with them or let the company keep it . majority prefer to keep it at the company 's safe ; it also guarantee that the residence permits be renew on time ; a it be a common practice that it be renew a week before it expiry .

 ca n't say with authority but i would guess that it be best to open an account with a bank that have a presence in your own home town .
 to open an account you need salary certificate and iqama copy with id copy or passport copy . open an account with qiib or qib ; if you take personnal loan or car loan.. there interest rate be very low compare to other bank . if you be look for good service then go for qnb .
 i believe qnb have the best banking service ; but perhaps not the most suitable interest rate or offer . you call any bank for require docuemtns to open an account .
 any bank will do
 it be well to open the account with those bank which have your company account . else ; you will be charge for transfer salary on a monthly basis . ie ; suppose your company be hold an account with doha bank and you have open an account with ahli bank ; you will be charge qr.25 for salary transfer every month . the document need be your passport copies & your id copy
 i use both doha bank and mashreq bank ... doha bank be quite good in service when you want to remit your money to your home land..
 which bank would you prefer to start an account ? ? ? am living in doha ... i wish to start a bank account here..please guide me about the document need to start an account ... .
 soniya ; money remittance be not the only service provide by banks ... i will never recommend doha bank ... the bad customer care ... i suggest qnb or ahli..
 dear ; without the company letter you can only open a save account ( with approx around qr500 a a starter deposit ) . all the expat require a company letter to open a current account . please give a try to cbq ( 2nd large local bank in qatar ) ... website www.cbq.com.qa and if you require help pm and will try to assist you .

 new school time what do parent think about the new school time due to more hour of arabic/islamic lesson in british curriculum run international school ?
 i think when u r in a islamic country ; one need to learn the culture and their language too ?
 so ?
 parent will not mind if school increase the lesson of arabic/islamic but teacher be suffer coz they forget to increase their salary . in international school all teacher be get good salary except the arabic/islamic teacher ; they get less than 30 % of the other teacher 's salary ; simply no fair
 yes you be right osama and i dont understand why arabic staff get pay less than other staff . it be baffle to me . some parent have complain at the new time ; especially in the young class because the day be too long . no rizks ; i want to know how most parent feel about the long day for their child ; due to the new compulsory increase in these subject .
 since when have the school day get longer ? ? ? not in our school ! ! !
 my child do n't even have any arabic class . the school only offer 1 second language choice in which i choose french . honestly i 'm a little disappointed they be not oblige to take arabic .
 lose in qatar ; i would not worry ... very few child ; even in school where arabic class be obligatory ; actually learn arabic ... .for various reason .
 those subject be there in the 80 's in all the school .
 my kid learn arabic from their friend ; because they spend a lot of time together at the beach and in the dune ! it 's easy a that . in their school arabic be a must for arabs ; but a choice for non-arabs .
 coming from dubai ; where it 's mandatory ; surprise that it be not here . my child learn quite al ot in kg1 and grade 1 ; they learn the alphabet ; learn how to read and write . they do n't always understand what they be read ; nonetheless i be shock on how much they have grasp the language . went back to canada for a year and now no arabic . i be seriously think of hire a private arabic teacher . i 'm sure it would all come rush back to them .
 new school time what do parent think about the new school time due to more hour of arabic/islamic lesson in british curriculum run international school ?
 2 hour of arabic use to be obligatory to all arabic speak child and 1 hour of islamic study to muslim child . now they have introduce 4 hour of arabic to all arabic speak child and non-arabic speaking child . 2hours of islamic and 2 hour of qatar history to all student . i have have mix opinion so far from parent but hear quite a lot of negative one . kids be absolutely shattered come 1 o'clock .
 well ; a to my experience ; if you mix arabic and non arabic speaker who ; obviously ; be on totally different level in the same class ; thing have to go down the drain . plus ; the teach method of the arabic teacher and the other teacher be vastly different .
 ah ok mt ; it be different in the school my child use to go to .
 7am-1.30am be my daughter 's timing and she attend one of the independant arabic school . are these internantional school actually go on for long ? that would be very tax !
 it use to be 7.15am - 12.15pm for early year ; 7am - 12.45pm for ks1 and 7am - 1pm for ks2 . now it 7 - 12.30 for early year and start off 7am - 1.40pm for ks1 & ks2 ; now it 1.30pm . big jump for the wee one especially ks1
 it must be tough and i do n't believe it will reap much benefit a the kid will be prolly too pooped out to concentrate much on anything let alone grasp a new language . hope the teacher then make the class a fun ; captivate and creative a possible.. not to mention loud nuff to snap them outta their sleepy haze !

 1 . none 2 . same same 3 . 20.000 to 70.000 4 . english 5 . leave qatar
 your profile read you be a qatari ; and you be ask u expat ?
 can we make the best for all of ql ? for a 4 yr old child and on ward : 1 . what be the school you recommend ? 2 . what be the advantage and disadvantage ? 3 . how much be the total yearly cost ? 4 . what be the main language which be teach in the school ? 5 . what be your advice to overcome a problem you have face with the school your son or daughter be study in ?
 first we have to know what kind of education you want for your child . as frenchies say ; values/ educational need may differ .
 1.in all honesty i be not totally satisfied with the school here ; but since both my husband and i wish that our daughter should become fluent in arabic ; we have her in an arabic independent or `` musthakhilla '' school . 2there be deffo plenty of con but since she be now rapidly improve in her arabic ; and do good nuff in her subject i will prefer to keep my complaint between the school staff and u . suffice to say i guess that no school can ever be perfect ! 3.around 12 ; 000qr 4.arabic and english only 5.well i 'd say it 's always best to build up a good relationship with the school 's administration and always address them promptly when face with any question and concern . this be crucial .
 seriously ; if sa want to know what is now ; then this be it : 1 . no school can be recommend 2 . therefore this question become obsolete 3 . current fee be between qar 12.000 to qar 70.000 per year 4.english and another language of choice ( arabic ; french ; spanish ; etc . ) 5 . administration should involve parent much more . currently there be just a drop-off and pick-up service the parent be involve in . all together : the school system in qatar be stone-age and a shame for the so-called 'richest country in the world ' !
 furthermore ; subject teacher should have at least a masters degree in their subject and should be continuously be train ! that should ; however ; go hand-in-hand with an annual increase of salary . as it be now ; education be cheap in qatar . cheap in the sense of low quality . all there be be expensive building !
 you be new here . i have be here 9 year now . for 9 year my child have attend a school where there be over 67 different nationality . there be muslim ; christians ; buddhist ; hindu and even jew there . they all exist in peace and mutual respect . what school ? -the american school of doha and no one have ever try to indoctrinate my child into anything . all they have do be provide them with an excellent educational and a taught them global citizenship . do n't talk of what you do n't know please . our family value be still very much in tact .
 yes ; the asd . but how many student can it accomodate ? 50.000 ? what about the poor one ? what 's the fee again ? 60.000 or 70.000 all together ? so ; we have one school in qatar . it 's occupy by child of oil company employee and a few sheikhs . what about the 90 % other child ? ?
 schools indoctrinate ? which one ? maybe the qur'an schools .
 they be go to get this thread whack too ... .poor brother straight arrow and his vision to make ql best for all . guys have pity on him and let him accomplish his mission..please no religious argument now !
 despite all the imperfection ; the numerous school and education center in qatar offer u ; locals and expats ; who be contrast and multifarious ; one thing : choice .

 in doha the sighting of anything other than gecko be rare but will increase a urbanisation continue and the reptile become familar with the new habitat . there be several excellent book on snake of arabia ; however ; you be only likelty to see them if your adventurous and in the desert . a few venture into grassy area but they be generally the harmless one . scorpians be poorly research locally and here generally hide by day and be quite small so be hard to see . using a uv light at night be a good way to find them a they be flourescent ! ! pretty cool . again more liklely to see them in rural area or on the beach . on spider your likely to find a few harmeless fella around the house ; but dont be to hasty to get risd of them a they keep the fly insect in check ; same a gecko . in the desert the camel spider be a mean bugger if you get bite but then you have to be pretty thick a their `` cave '' and web be pretty obvious .
 we like camp and be hop to go camp in the desert ... would this be advisable with the scorpion etc ? gecko 's and lizard we can handle ; in fact we have always want one inour house ! but anything with more than 4 leg ... .yughh !
 hmmm.. and why would they do something like that ? ? for fun ? : s and by-the-way .. this doesnt make any sense at all ! -- > `` make gathering and pray jesus ; worship god or else.. they be also check if any car have any kind of stuff relate with religions.. '' ; emad = >

 there be no such a thing happen in qatar because qatar be an islamic country and in islam it forbidden to block access of people for pray or worship there god regardless there religion
 mmmmm i do wonder britexpat ... ..maybe 'churches to go 'should warn ... ..
 saudi be an exception : ) anyway in saudi no one stop you to worship your god in your home !
 ohhhh ; ok so next time i see a religious gathering in the city centre ... ..i 'll think uh-oh ... .

 maybe in such a case they will deport people ; but if someone just practice their own religion in their own home/privacy ; why to deport ? they can not expect to hire all muslims ? like in my case ; there be some born again friend who try to invite me for a so call bible study . i tell them i 'm cool with that coz it do n't cause me any harm and i 'd like to understand their belief . but next time i 'm invite them in my religion too to understand mine . why ca n't we just live and let live ?
 do we have a licence for the dhow trip ; charan . omg !
 md - i say religeous and political gathering not social gathering : ) ban spoon feeding not me
 religious ; political ; social . wait until i meet you . i will try to convert you to a normal person . is it allowed ?
 heard people who be be deport for have prayer/meditation meeting . well ; qatar have not exactly promise anyone freedom of worship ; as far a i know ... so you wan na stay here ? chuck ur religion ( except those 'allowed ' by the authority )
 magicdragon - `` i will try to convert you to a normal person . '' even my mother give up that long time ago : ) ban spoon feeding not me
 does this mean i have to take my neon jesus off my dashboard ?
 you should do that anyways ; gypsy . it might turn into a bullet in a crash !
 he probably do ; gypsy ; like everybody here do ; too . but law of physic also apply to him like to anything in the universe . so ; be careful .

 apple ; where i come from ; bible study be perform by a group of people who study the bible literally a write ; it have nothing to do with christianity ; we call `` jehovah witness '' ; they use the old testimony ; do n't think that by attend that meeting ; you will have an idea about christianity ; it a sect ; not a religion . they meet to read the bible ; and explain it without go into spirituality and stuff ... their main objective be to attract you ; they do not believe in jesus a we christians do . anyhow ; i believe i go into too much detail ; it up to you to accept them or not . also ; people be free in their believe ; i do n't consider that we should express it through gadget ; or cross ; or ... just pray ; and believe .
 xena : i guess this be not about church but more about prayer & meditation gathering do by people of other faith .
 u meant vijay ?
 jehovah witness be different from born again christians ; the latter do believe in jesus . but they dont believe with pope ; and the saint ; and they dont believe in such kind of stone image of virgin mary or any saint ; they dont even believe that jesus be the one in the picture with long beard and to my surprise they dont believe in christmas day be the birth of jesus ? at least that 's what i learn meantime : ) ) jehovah witness ? be not sure ; never attend yet to any of their gathering ... .
 alot of these gathering goin on in qatar . does it mean they have to be careful from the cid to get deport too ? p/s arien ; it you who 's hijack the thread my dear ; be talk about religious gathering in qatar ; but you be talk about me : ) ) ) lol !
 lot of comment from various frens.. but guy and gals.. this be true a lot of frens describe here also.. i also come to know from my frens that some of the qp senior staff be also be deported.. so be careful ...
 i commend you for your stand . how much do you want for the car ? ?
 wonder if that have anything to do with whats happen ? ? ? ? `` your born ; you live ; you die ; give this premise ; one can conclude since we have no control over when we be bear and when we die ; the only thing that matter to u should be how we live ; simple really ? '' mis-cat to her philosophy lecturer .
 like i say earlier ; i hear that both christians and hindus have be deport ; and that the reason give be that they be try to convert others . i think everyone know that non-muslim ; monotheistic religion be tolerate in qatar ; but within boundary . for example ; the church have be tell they may not erect cross . it seem obvious that if the church be n't allow to display cross ; then it 's probably forbidden to display cross ; fish or any other christian symbol on your car . i think most people also know that try to convert people be a big problem here . apostasy for a muslim carry a death penalty ; and encourage a muslim to convert to another religion be both cruel and stupid . if a person make a complaint to the police about religious activity it will probably be investigate . to avoid trouble ; do n't carry religious literature around with you . do n't engage people in a conversation about your god unless you know they share the same faith . do n't discuss someone else 's god unless you know your audience wo n't be offend . for christians ; especially evangelical one ; spread the good news be part of their religious practice . that practice place people on a collision course with the local authority . some people will take the risk on board ; and continue to proselytize ; but they have no reason to complain when they get kick out of the country . it be unreasonable to sympathize with those who have be punish for proselytizing ; when their activity be risk the life of those they seek to convert .

 apple.. hijack ? ! ! ! what do that mean ? ? : ) : ) : )  every society be judge by how it treat it 's least fortunates .
 your comment be not for me ; apology for this . but i think it just like hang a small qur'an or a `` mishba '' in our car ; we felt protect . its part of their belief .
 ahh hmmm wait ... let me check mr. webster ; )
 i 'm not sure with others ; but if you ask me a a muslim ? ... .sure i can relate with you guy . i still feel it very injustice to deport anyone due to religious belief unless he/she try to convert any muslim in that country coz just like ngourly say ; he/she will put someone 's life at risk by do that . though ; personally i have no problem w/ someone preaching and try to convert me coz i have my own faith which be strong in i believe . so long the person who preach me wont stop me from practice my own belief ; then i 'm cool with that .
 because there be factor that make me skeptical of the people convince me . i 'd rather more likely to be convince on the testimony of one person 's life.that be practice your faith in your daily life . for me by just read the bible literally ; do n't make me see god . but i can see & feel god through people ; ordinary people . i think that 's the real essence of be christian or be one that believe there be only one god ; one creator.he maybe call in many name depends on which part of the universe we be ; but i guess he be still the one .
 i be serious to answer you too . i be put a small qur'an in my car because of it content . in my belief some aya 's and doa'a in it will able to help me shoo away shaytan and be safe travelling . do u mean i should n't believe it or do it make me shirk ? kindly enlighten me ? tnx : )
 so apple ; dont you think that read while you drive to protect yourself be a bit of a contradiction ? you dont need to memorize them all ; there be specific ayas and duas a you say ; and if memory serf me correctly ; you recite the ayat al kursi for safe travel .  `` diplomacy be the art of say 'nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - will rogers ''
 ok ; so i be try to get a definative answer . you say you keep it in the car to protect you ; then you say you keep it because there be some ayas and duas to read to keep you safe . you say you keep it because you cant remember these ayas and duas ; so logically to use them to keep you safe while drive you would have to be read them right ? means i still have get no clear answer why this protect you in the car .  `` diplomacy be the art of say 'nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - will rogers ''

 it will be a good idea ; if implement but i will personally suggest it should be 22 yr . i have see very young driver drive land cruisers like a plane and they think like the others be like ant on the road .
 the gossip we be hear from almost 1 year . but it 's not so strong idea . because the young people will drive without license if they not provide at 18 year age . than it will be more problem for them as well a for u . well give them correct drive skill so that they will be careful as well a all of u . most of the reckless driver ( young ) you see on the road be have license after 1/2 or more year their driving without license ! ! !
 the only thing that can stop these reckless driver be more radar and to increase the number of black point to 5 or 6 when they exceed the limit set on the particular street .
 do not forget high fine for traffic violation . the one thing that seem to open their eye be a heavy drain on their pocket book
 getting car lisence after 2012 or 13 after 2012 or 2013 we can only get car lisence in qatar if we be over 21.is this true..
 hope there be some system to confiscate the car of the reckless driver ; and should be give a small car to drive for some day ... even i wonder how it would be if some policeman be deploy to survey the road ( drive thru a strech of road ) along with camera ; in small civilian car to see and catch the culprit easily !
 everytime i suprice him mac be also good

 join a group of photography enthusiast and you 'll be able to learn not just basic course ... try this ... http : //www.qatarliving.com/group/qatar-living-photography
 education.. if you find one ; please let me know.. my husband and i would love to join ! !
 i really need to start charge for my course - i could make a fortune ! ql have a regular informal get together every second tuesday where we take picture and chat about photography . last week i give a small group a lesson on the basic . i suggest a a start point you join the ql photography group and search through it 's topic a there be some good link to photo basic there . click here : http : //www.qatarliving.com/group/qatar-living-photography and on particular ; click here : http : //www.qatarliving.com/node/226360
 well ... all i can say be photography be all about creativeness and a few camera parameter to keep yourself well aware of . i buy my first canon powershot sx100 is and shot a few really amazing photo just by read the manual . most people who be unable to use a gadget properly be either sick of read manual or careless enough to use it in `` auto '' mode . a camera have 4 main parameter to adjust while take picture of subject in different light and movement condition ; viz : shutter speed ; iso ; exposure time and aperture value . read about how these parameter work together on the internet and you 'd know how close you 're to become a photographer . joining a course to master the skill sound ridiculous to me . the choice be yours anyway . cheers !
 if you 're in the market for a big screen television like 50 50-inches and above -- then i 'd suggest plasma a a safe bet . plasmas give you more bang for your buck at the big end of town ; and while lcds can give you good resolution ; plasma still have the edge in term of picture quality . one other thing to look for ; whether you opt for plasma or lcd ; be an integrated tuner -- many tvs still have analogue tuner ; which look pretty terrible on a large screen . try to get a model with an inbuilt hd tuner if you can . at the small end of thing ( 15 '' to 42 '' tvs ) ; lcd be the only way to go if you want something slim and tasteful .
 i would go for lcd
 lcd hand down . in almost everyway ; lcd win ; it be superior . if movie look bad on satellite ; it the decoder fault . you might also look into not using composite cables a they make it useless to own a hd tv . use vga ; dvi or hdmi . using a component cable for a hd tv ; be bad than buy a ferarri ; without any gas . yes it that pointless .
 lcd be a good choice .
 i go for plasma . unless you will be use the blue ray or blu ray record then you may able to watch the most cosmetized picture of all . lcd may give you the clear picture of all but as far a true color realism be concern for me plasma be the best .
 plasma or lcd ? lcd or plasma tv ? i beleive plasma be well for cable and sit tv ? there be a good samsound 42inch plasma in carrefour ; lulu and virigin . series 4 42a410 i think it be . qr3979 good buy ?
 buy philips ; sony ; hitachi ; panasonic but do not buy samsung . samsung tvs will not support you for more than 1 and half 2 year . i do agree ; nothing match the picture quality but it be good if you be plan the tv for a short term .
 first try to insert different cd and check if it will give sound . if it do ; try to remove your cd rom from your laptop to check it . try to clean it as well use the cd-rom cleaner disk .
 careless user that 's why sound 's come ... ... ... ... ... ..if u have warranty card why u dont bring ur laptop to the service center state at the warranty card.to check when the sound come .
 mostly the cd-rom make sound when it corrupt or when you put a corrupted cd inside . so please try to change the cd and see how it be .. if the laptop be underwarrnty then please take to service center and get it fixed . it really tough to replace the cd-rom drive if it not under warranty a it internal part and tough to find the replacement with same size ..
 what be the model of your laptop ? if your cd-rom can detach from your laptop.. do it . but remember to turn off your laptop first before you do that.. after you detach it from you laptop . open your laptop . then turn off again . put back the cd-rom . it work to me.. try it . good luck !
 does it make noise all the time or just with a certain cd ?
 online ... ..

 ur next question will b wht r the timing of airport ...
 you have n't state be it the international school or girl 's school however both do n't have a good reputation especially the girl 's school . they be not good to their staff ; have load of after school meeting that be n't productive and a waste of time . teacher 's could use that time more productively for class prep etc.salary depends on your nationality . if i be you i would n't accept a position their !
 i be a student at cambridge until 2009 and dunno how the situation be now but i can honestly say it be one of the bad school at that time the student behavior be horrible . so horrible that they have to bring in like 10 security guard and put in camera all over the school the teacher be mostly indian with a couple of english in high ranking position but head of security ( an arabic lady ) be basically rule the school.even the teacher be scar of her . this be obviously a student perspective from two year ago so dont take it too seriously if i have to list all it 's fault the character limit will be pass
 u r treat like a slave der ; u have load of work plus u dont get any dignity der.cisg ; tcs and dmis be run by poor management.u can be throw and put any be ; any place and they make maximum use of you.so be careful before accept any offer from dem
 thank you all for your advice ... you scar me actually ! i think that it be a good school since it 's `` cambridge '' ! ! it 's surprising that most of the stuff be indians ...
 job offer in cambridge school hi everyone ; i recently get a job offer in the cambridge school and i need a feedback about that college : the environment ; the ambiance ; how do they treat their stuff ; the salary ... i really need your advice . i 'll be thankful . does anyone work there ?
 do not go there ; a close friend of mine work there so i get all of the story all bad one ; the indian regime ; the attitude be horrible ; if you have be offer a job there then you be highly likley to be offer somewhere else ; the cheap possible air fare home rout through dubai overnight ; the delay salary in july ; pay in september so you will return etc ; etc ; etc
 there be a lot of school who use word like `` cambridge '' `` oxford '' `` american '' `` british '' `` international '' i can open a school call the international new york school for fine arts and none of those word have any relationship to the type of school i operate . good for you for ask here first .

 rizk you will not understand dont scartch your head you dog head .
 advice me.. my brother be work in technip a sr. mechnacial engr ; after complete his contract/project he leave to india 6 month ago . how can i bring him on visit visa or on under my sponsership . please advise me .
 if it a fat bugger like rizkz either in front or the back ; all three would have plunge in to the ditch : ( so bodyweight also count in team building ? ?
 nice pic.. hope som1 will giv u a gud advice
 did your brother get a noc ( certificate or letter ? )
 previous employer assure him get the noc ; but the question be he be not come for employment ; he be come to visit me only under my sponshership .
 salam iq755 ; send an official letter request them to issue an noc letter to apply for family visit visa under your sponsorship and to exempt him from two-year ban ( in case your brother be employ less than 2 year ) . attached your passport and rp copy ; and so his passport and rp cancellatin page copy . further ; there be no harm if he will be back here for visit or work or whatever legitimate purpose he intents . it 's a basic human right to earn his living or conduct his private legal business . no one can bar you from that so just be honest with his previous employer to avoid a can of worm . knowing technip ; i do n't think they will hold any issue against your brother for his visit or work again here in qatar unless your brother have a linger bad reputation . hope the above help .
 assalaamualaikum wa rahmatullah : sixroomvilla . thanks for the good advice.. mean i have to send a letter to his previous employer request for noc for visit visa under my sponsership . right ! !

 you can apply online for a visit visa ; for any nationality . in fact ; all nationality now have to have a visa prior to entry . used to be ok for commonwealth ; then they change it to only new zealand ; and now ; even the kiwi 's need a visa . i can tell you ; whatever you do ; dont try to take food in ; a they be extremely strict . another trick to avoid huge delay 's at the airport be to declare something . that way ; they be happy ; and will ; relatively speaking ; leave you alone . if you dont declare thing ; and get pick out for inspection ; you will be there for age . love my country ; but it be a total pain travelling to and fro ; even a a citizen . and ; qatar do not have an embassy or consul here . you need to go to the near useless embassy in abu dhabi ; uae . three time i have try to get very simple thing do ; and all three time fail .

 whats the comparison between pregnant woman and idiot ? ? ? lol : )
 will pregnancy affect employment offer my friend 's wife will receive a job offer from a government office in another 4 -5 days.today they come to know that the lady be 1 month pregnant.will this affect her employment offer and what about the medical prior to join job too .
 speaking a a pregnant woman ; sometimes we can be idiots . around the third trimester you 'd forget your own head if it be n't attach to you .
 i think it not a problem ; but she will not be elgible for meternity leave before one yr ...
 normally pregnancy be not look a a hindrance . esp in the govt sector here in doha . but good to mention orally before the test go through . honesty never fail !
 looking at it from an hr point of view ; she 's not a good investment . first of all she 'll have to take quite a bit of time off in her first 9 month ( for doctor appts . sick leave ; etc ) as well a 54 day of maternity leave ; and the likely hood of her come back to work be slim . i would n't hire her .
 as per experience ; yes it will surely affect her job offer . i be one of the recruitment officer in one of the govt office before ; and it one of the policy that they ca n't hire a pregnant woman even in some govt & private office that i 've know . their reason : 1st ; they will think that you will be go to file your long day leave upon delivery or often to file a leave during pregnancy . 2nd ; they will probably think that you can not exert ur best effort in do your job because usually pregnant woman feel so many body change ; body pain etc ; and sometimes some superior be hesitant to give work load to their staff if she be pregnant . 3rd : ur medical result will be stamp a unfit to work if find out that your pregnant ... so the best thing ; if your planning to look for work ; dont get pregnant ; but you can get pregnant if you already hire or start to work ( bec . that 's 2 different case ) ...
 even with the smiley face that be harsh prism : -p ; not true for many many pregnant woman ; but mm be right too . anyway ; even while be pregnant and hormonally on a roller coaster ; pregnant woman can be extremely active and bring good result on the work front . coming to the op ; if the medical be already over ; then nothing really to worry about ; except probation may go longer ; once they know the employee be pregnant . if medical be not complete yet ; and if the candidate be really require by the company ; then a temporary job offer may be present to her ; and only when she return back from her maternity leave ; will her job become permanent . it all depend upon their hr policy .
 agree with arlene advise ; it all country rule not to hire pregnant unless nobody qualify for the post in the country or the applicant be a scientest .
 i wish her all the best ;
 han19 ... i didnt mean to be harsh ... just state reality from a corporates pov ... for idiot i think there be no issue ... for pregnant woman come on board afresh ; other woman have already elaborate on it ... .and smiley be just to soften the pinch of reality ... : ) but still if it sound harsh my apology to whomever it may concern ; a it be unintentional .
 if she receive a job offer letter and later get turn away ; then she may file a claim for discrimination . i do n't know if that can go anywhere in this legal system . but if she get hire ; her employer will have the right of put her under unpaid leave ; during the 50-day maternity leave period . for more detail ; read art . 96 of the labour law ( see below ) `` a female worker who have be employ by an employer for a complete year shall be entitle to maternity leave with full pay for a period of fifty day . such maternity leave shall include the period before and after the delivery provide that the period follow the delivery shall not be less than thirty five day . ''
 will pregnancy affect employment offer my friend 's wife will receive a job offer from a government office in another 4 -5 days.today they come to know that the lady be 1 month pregnant.will this affect her employment offer and what about the medical prior to join job too .
 2012 olympics ; i have work a a recruiter for over 14 year and i can witness how woman can be far more productive during their pregnancy .
 maybe they can . but your view be not the view of most employer here .
 in my similar yr of work under ; along side and in supervise capacity didnt see or hear anyone of them be a productive when they be not pregnant ... the tough one be those who have the hobby of get pregnant ( every year ) ... find someone to delegate for them use to be a big challenge for understandable reason .
 well ; 2012 olympics ; the way you write your previous comment make it look more like your own perspective as an employer . testing an applicant for pregnancy be nothing but an act of discrimination . i can not argue whether be legal or not in this country ; but be just my humble opinion on this particular issue . prism ; i know what you 're talk about ; but it 's a matter of education and culture and company would need to enforce a strict recruitment control ; ensure that all applicant go through proper channel and procedure . we all suffer the same not only from pregnant woman but also from male slacker who will keep calling-in sick almost every sunday or thursday for no apparent reason .
 after the medical check-up they will inform to the employer and it 's the employer decision . if the employer be ok with that ; they have no problem to accept you and process your paper
 all sport shop sell tennis ball but for cricket use a black masking tape on the ball to make it heavy
 for any cricket gear ... call mr mohd sabir on 5313049 the the main guy who supply to all cricket in doha qatar ; mostly all product be good quality and make in pakistan ; very resonable his home shop be behind olympic sport the tennis ball you be look for ; he have them and he also supply them to the local league match
 the one that u be look for be call mri i believe ... red in colour !
 check in sports corner or centre ( i don remember exact name of the shop but it start with sport ) near the sword signal . heavy tennis ball be available there . i buy it from there b4 1 month . might be available now
 i do the same ; after i come back from vacation and go in for renewal of car registration i have to pay a penalty for pay the fine late ; i have to pay some sixty riyal extra other than the fine which be five hundred ; so good sort it out as quick a u can ; good luck
 traffic viloation . i have a traffic violation and i need to travel for a business meeting . do i need to pay it before apply for an exit permit or it be ok i will just pay it once i will renew my car registration ? thanks
 thanks for your reply ... i have a stupid violation `` i didnt turn my light on in cornich at night '' and when i be catch the police tell me of a 300 qar fine but when i check it online ; it be 1000 qar . some guy say i can ask the police to change the fine but i dont have much time and i dont know where to go so i just leave it . now i be charged 1000 qar . will this give me any problem to get my exit permit ?
 if you be think of challenge this fine then ; wait until you comeback from your trip . otherwise it take only a few minute to pay the traffic fine ; please settle the fine before travel and be free for all worry .
 if it be the red signal jumping ( qr . 6000 ) it be well to pay and visit . otherwise ; for small amount ; they will allow you to go out of airport ; you may pay late
 too expensive..better send money and she will buy parfume in egypt .
 check with dhl or ups or you can buy online and diliver to her address
 noha ; how about send this expensive gift through some of your know people ? ? do you know someone here in doha who can take parcel alongwith him/herself while they go egypt ? ?
 no sonia iam new here in doha and i donot know anyone go to egypt yet : (
 i dont think it be a single step process . your new apartment will have a meter and a number give by kahrmaa . you will need to have that no when u go to kahrmaa and also the receipt which be give to you when you pay the adv for the current house . you will ofcourse have to fill out the transfer form and they will make the transfer . but you need to let them know when you be shift so that they can give you the connection before you shift . i guess thats about it . it all i do when i shift but that be in 2006. i doubt if much have change but here you never know . also have copy of your rp ; passport and id and a fotograph just in case and a copy of your new lease agreement .
 find kahrama office service depend on you area .. you need to cancel the first contract and the initiate new one .. not two bird in one shot .. cancellation procedure : 1- take photo of the meter reading of electrisity and water both .. 2-fill up the form of cancellation 3- copy of your identity card 4-copy of your tenancy contract 5-copy of gurantee slip ( 2000 ) qr then they will calculate your balance and issue check qnb or you have to pay in case your previous payment exceed the limit of 2000 qr advance ; next step initiate new account ... same procedure when you apply first time ... goodluck : ) )
 alright ! the only thing that worry me be i can not find the receipt for the deposit . someone tell me this be not compulsory ; be that true ?
 need your advice on kahramaa i be in the process of shift between two apartment from two different landlord . this mean i 'll need to terminate the kahramaa contract for the old apartment and start a new one ; be this something you can do in a single step process ? if you have do this before ; what be the best way of do it ?
 mike - if you dont have the receipt how can you claim the advance that you have pay ? what be the proof ? it be need .
 tinker ; i will have to fight that battle because if i be not wrong ; my account clearly state that i currently have a qr2000 credit ; how would they give me such credit without have pay the deposit ?
 wish you luck mike cuz know how people in govt depts here work you have a long battle ahead of ya ! no two person at the same counter will give you the same reply ! try it ! .. : ) btw do you have that paper they give you once you get your connection ? they give some proof of your connection with your name and detail etc . i think you can use that too ... .. what you say be logically correct mike but here ... ..ahhh well - wish you luck ! and keep u posted ! ... . : ) )
 i be not say that you be wrong but i be hop you be not right ; - )
 and i be hop you get it all do without much hassle ! ... . : ) )
 mike ; of all the thing i 've ever have to do in doha ; closing and then re-opening my electricity be possibly the single most frustrating encounter with a government agency . take a few day off work ; it 's not go to be a duck in ; duck out task you can do in your lunch break !
 fubar - with that statement you just scar the living daylight outta mike ... : p
 wish you all the luck ! ! ! you will need patience more honestly ... and prayers ! ... : )
 i be not sure of move within two apts . but disconnect and get my refund take me not more than an hour ... .as be advise go early in the morning to kharama office ... the technician come along a i be the first customer ; take the reading ; go back to there office ; he upload the detail and give me a print which i carry to one of the officer for his signature and then to the cash counter ; get my money ... . everything happen as smoothly a it can be .
 tinker ... lol ... thing generally be easy ; it just your approach to thing ... . : ) still smile everytime i call qtel no . 111 and be through in first dial ... touchwood ... : )

 fubar ... you may be right there a my ( good ) experience i state also be with their office near jaidah flyover ...
 ok everything be handle in 30 minute . went to the musheireb branch at 6:45am ; a gentleman take all my paperwork include picture of the old apartment 's reading ; so no need to call for a technician ! they make an estimation for the final settlement ; get reimburse with the difference and then have to reopen a new account and pay a new deposit of 2100 qr . it be very easy ; all thanks to mr. hamad from the main counter .
 i advice u to contact your embassy what be the procedure ; but anyway in our office once they give birth they have to come to our office to register the new birth ; after registration of birth they have to apply a new passport for thier child in order to obtain an rp in doha . have a good day !
 dear ; first decide very well what name you shall give ? after birth take father and mother passprot copy and marriage certificate . if bear in hamad hospital it be quiet easy . if not ( doha/ al ahalia clinic then get birth notification from the hospital ) and go to the birth registration office ( next to lulu center ; opp hamad clinic ) and produce the letter in ground floor reception along with marriage certificate ; parent passport and rp copy . by the time you can also get child vacination card . after that they will ask you to go to third floor . the will ask father and mother rp and qualification certificate . give it in 3rd floor and pay in ground floor . accord to number of copy you will pay . after a week you can collect it.later take it to embassy and get birth certificate from them and apply for passport . after get passport you can also apply and get rp .
 dear sir ; first tell me ? what be your nationality ; call me i will help you ; call 6550792 i will prepare all necessary documentation for your baby pp and visa also need services please call .

 why in the world would you wan na share an hotel room with some one who be not marry to you ? ?
 unfortunatly my wife forget it back in the u.k ; we be both here now spend extra money on 2 room . im look for a way to spend time with my wife without fly all the way back just for a peice of paper
 just book it in one of your name ; and then later have the other person jump on the elevator and join you upstairs . be discreet ; take precaution ; but it can be do . if you 're caught/confronted ; claim you 're married and that you just do n't have the paperwork on hand to prove it . be outrage and indignant ... especially if you 're both western ; this usually work . they really only care if one of you be asian/arab ; or if a a couple you 're be really overt and in your face about thing ; lot of pda 's etc . loads of guy here ( local and expat ) book hotel room and manage to use them with a prostitute or with their regular girlfriend ... good luck !
 have someone back home scan your marriage certificate and e-mail it to you . do a good job in color and it likely wo n't be question . just print it off and only show it if specirically ask to ... ..
 land cruiser or prado
 which be the best 4wd ? which be the best 4wd ( 2nd hand ) to buy between price range 60 ; 000-70 ; 000qr ? ?
 the one i have
 prado v6 ; the other one suck .
 xterra offroad ! ! !
 will you use it for dune bashing ? or just for city road like those `` never be offroad '' 4wd user : ) for dune bashing : land cruiser ; patrol ; pajero ; pathfinder ; cherokee classic ; etc .
 if you budget be 60 ; 000-70 ; 000 then good go for pajero ; a you can get a good condition pajero 2007-2008 model . but if you be plan for sand dune ; then pajero be not an ideal car . you have to look for land cruiser or patrol .
 4wheel drive for what purpose ? if you want to use for daily commuting ; all 4wd be goood . all depend on your budget . for serious off-roading ; go for jeep wrangler . if you be look for just size and comfort ; good you should look for after sale support ; ease of spare availability ; easy to maintain and easy to sell . in this catagory only toyota and nissan would be best choice .

 go to the near police station in your area and ask the officer .

 most of car wash place have it ; check with them .
 most car wash do n't have tire air pressure ; i ask lot of petrol station and they tell me that the only station that have tire air pressure be like 8 km ( hamour ) ; even that station they do n't have air pressure for tire ; instead there be tire repair shop next to them . there 's plenty of tire repair shop around doha . if you tell me about ur exact location ; i can make use of my gps : )
 tire shops get it ; suggest you buy yourself an instrument to measure the pressure yourself ( cost from 35 rials ) and if you buy yourself a compressor you be self sufficient .
 woqood patrol & service station ; you can check the tyre pressure ; all the simple service
 open the driver seat door and near to the seat at the bottom there be the tyre pressue value . you can see that and put air . this be available in all the car . ; ; see ya

 hi ; i believe all schengen visa application be dealt with via the german embassy in doha . probably best to check their website for further detail . best of luck .
 i think swedish embassy be in kuwait . there be a thread in ql earlier in 2010 regareding this issue ( do a search ) . you may call and ask them or you may check with the embassies of other schengen country ( france ; germany etc . ) for further detail . i dont think you need insurance document for apply the visa .
 you can apply for schengen visa through any other schengen country ( france ; germany - pretty much all of the eu country ) although apparently they all have different rule ; so look around . i assume you will be catch a flight through another eu country anyways ; so just have to have a stop over probably . good luck !
 no need of have swiss embassy to get shengen visa . you can use service of german embassy to get this . it be in bin omran ... . opposit side of ahli hospital ; ; the road near salaam ho . ( i dont know they change location )
 8 month be not tooo much i think ... but anyway u can consult a doctor ; i suggest dr.khudsiya beegum ; alwaab street ( khalifa stadium ) you need to go there to get register for first time ; the clinc timing be 8:00 am to 12:00 noon then from 16:00 to 20:00 from surterday to thursday . contact : 44475969
 if you be take alcohol or tobacco ; cut down . get yourself free from any stress . winter be come . do not loose hope .
 i advice to go to hamad hospital ... as khudsia begum be not the best doctor . just this site make good advertising for her ... being in emergency situation i do not get any help from her ... just be re-directed to hamad ... but their money they take accurately . so i do not trust any private hospital . for the money they charge at dr. khudsia 's clinic they could at least provide the tissue and soap in lady ' wc ... .
 my wife be not consume ? can any body suggest good hospital for checkup my wife in not consume from 8 month ; can any body suggest good hospital for check up .
 you need basic investigation that can be do with any gynaec dr.even dr.beegum be ok for that .

 dear friend ; i have live in uae for more than 12 year and an year back only shift to doha ; qatar . of all the 7 emirate ; in term of house rent ; abu dhabi be consider to be the most expensive but al ain be less populate ; the price you pay for a two bedroom ordinary flat ; you may get a 3 bedroom villa in al ain.that too ; due to recession effect ; the price be expect to be slash . the school be also easy to get admission due to the same reason of less populated area . a quite place but you will get easy access to all basic amenity ; like shop ; taxi stand . even the taxi fare be comparatively less than other emirates esp dubai . hope this information be useful to you . if i come across some more significant info ; will definitely post it or will pm you . regards ;

 where can i find computer hardware where can i find hardware computer shop ? it be not sell computer a a whole . or laptop ; ( not like jarir or carefour ) . i want to know where i can get hardware thing like motherboard ; ram ; cpu ; etc . please tell me where it exactly be and what the name be . i have find some but it be not big a i think it would be . can you show me what be the big one and nearly every component brand be there ? thanks very much .
 oops sorry ; a fault . delete the 2 post above please . thx : ) i have find a store call 'tornado ' store and it 's on the sofitel area man . it 's a good store with processors ; ram ; motherboard ; graphic cards ; casing ; etc and even up to corsair h80 . but the problem be that they do n't have good quality power supply ( antec ; seasonic ; corsair ; etc ) they only have gigabyte and cooler master : ( . i 'm look forward if there be a good store and it would be really good if you show me what be it 's name and where it be exactly . but if no then i should order the part that be not available there : ( .
 yea that gigabyte store be one of the best around here ( the one just opposite sofitel / mercure grand ) . you 'll not find an antec ; seasonic in here . i wait for 6 month for a scheduled business trip to dubai to pick up an antec earthwatts . picked it up on bur dubai . there be a place similar to sofitel / mercure grand ... just more big and good ( do n't remember which one ; but all the taxi folk know it ) ..
 because cheap labour with the neccessary skill set be available there .
 not only hp ; and not only qatar
 almost all laptop now be make in china . you can ask the sale person in any shop and you 'll find the same answer . others part of the laptop may come from other country but still the laptop itself be make in china . ranking of the laptops here in qatar be like of the ff : 1st . dell/ toshiba/ sony/ hp 2nd acer/ compaq/ fujitsu 3rd lenovo/ benq mine be an acer laptop . it really work for me and it do not give me any headache . it 's cool . its in the matter of how you take care and use your laptop . good luck and all the best !
 hp battery back up suck ...
 all laptop be make in china . only a limited number of sony vaio be make in japan . you can get one for like qar 8 ; 000 or qar 9 ; 000 . also ; they be plan to discontinue the production in japan . so ; if you want a japanese laptop ; you need to hurry .
 it co the labour charge in china be cheap ... the part be source from other countires though ; it just assemble in china ... i personally use an acer ferrari which be make in china and no probs so far
 thankssssssssssssssssssssssssss guy ... ... .

 i would put it in my wifes hand bag and go to paris
 keep half ; invest half of that ( ie . quarter ) and give the other half away - to genuinely needy people - not the cheater who take advantage of people 's goodwill .
 i would give about 10 % to sadaka ( charity ) and invest a big portion of the rest ; and the other small portion i would perhaps travel the world : )
 convert it into indian one rupee notes and employ someone to count them continuosly at the rate of one note per second for 5 months .
 i would invest it in drive lesson for most of the driver here on the road ! i have never see such bad and dangerous driving in my whole life .
 make a model town for the slum in my country and educate the poor .
 i will never spend that ; i will encash it to 50 riyal lot ; and just keep it on my table and look at it for one year and try to retrieve as much a pleasure and enjoy the presnece of that package infront of me always . i know the basic principle already that money be what money do . ; but that be only for the money i earn . here i mean by this exercise the retention of happiness and pleasure throughout the life from what i unexpectedly get from a source in which i have no effort at all . one thing in here to remind it . ; when there be no happiness radiate to me from that for any reason ; then i have somthing to do it . that be still suspence . lol . ; let me first see when this happents to me .
 what will you do if you have million dollar cash with you ? what will you do if you have million dollar cash with you ?
 give the half to my hubby ; and invest the other half at the bank of switzerland . so ambitious ! : )

 why homeschool ? why not embrace the country you be live in ? when i live in uk i send my kid to uk school . it 's a great chance to share culture .
 to go to a qatari school when you do n't speak a word of arabic . it 's my understanding that the public qatari school only accept qatari child . check out : http : //dohahomeeducators.wordpress.com/ alternatively check out : www.k12.com/
 learning about culture be important ; but have good education be more important . my boy do n't speak any arabic . they have to be place in a school with english program and these school be few and most of the time they have long waiting list .

 which be best accounting software for small/medium business ? which be the best trouble free ; user friendly and strong software for small/medium business ? tally/peach-tree etc ... . ?
 for small to medium scale type of business..myob be good coz you can customize everything..from form to type of business you have ... quickbooks be also good ... best for those with much receivables and for those who be send their bill via email ... peachtree..combination of the two..
 myob be really well support . however ; locally people be use all sort of unknown like peach tree etc . stick with the commercial grade `` off-the-shelf '' myob * : 'proud supporter of canterbury bulldogs ; '' * doggies rulz
 a per experience ; quickbooks and peach tree be most common . they be really easy to use and understand . they can be customize a per need of your business . check what suit your need and thaqt will be the best though . kudos !
 for the medium and small scale business tally be goodenough than all other software of it range . when compare to peachtree it have a lot of thigs which be essential for an accounting department . i am authorised tally consultant and reseller . pls contact me for further details . sameer mob : 5812978 email : sameerplk @ gmail.com
 from my humble experience peach tree be complicate and not that user friendly and i think u should have extensive course for it ; ; but to tell the truth it have alot of potential a well
 ofcourse ... ql

 dunestock 2009 ? be it happen or what ? when ? where ?
 thought i read somewhere that it be go to be after summer
 errrrrr so what 's dunetock ? ?
 i think you have the image in your profile from last year do you mind post them here for others to know it < img src= '' http : //www.qatarliving.com/files/images/da.gif '' >
 do the band play while the dune sing ? whatever you vividly imagine ; ardently desire ; sincerely believe and enthusiastically act upon ; must inevitably come to pass .

 i 'll be reach doha by end of june ; hope it not before that ... last time the sandstorm be a pain ... let 's see this year ...
 info can be get from doha players - they do email me to say nov ; but i ca n't find their email with date on ! < i > this be picture be obviously not me ; i do n't smoke.. < i >
 thanks ; i 'll bump this post up later . i go in my first few week of be here in qatar . this tim ei will be well prepared and take some time off the next day so i can be around after dark = ) mitch
 the last i hear it have be move to november . i think after summer would be a little too hot . november should be cool . i hope they give enough advance notification for auditions this year . with the quad bike issue be reduce last year ( compare to 2007 ) underage youth play loud rap music and get drunk be a rather disturbing site . too obvious to miss the fact they be not there for the music . this create an unwanted nuisance for dune stocker with family and loyal dune stocker who have be present since it come into existance . as i musician ; it put me down a bit . i miss civil defense i.e . police patrol the area like the year before . that will automatically reduce `` underage '' activity take place.. ( or atleast in the open public ) i be also aware the there have always be an issue with volunteer back out at the end moment . i think get a group of loyal mature musician and music fan ( period ) from ql to help support dunestock would be a great idea . i think at event like these ; it almost common sense that they need all the support they can get.. oh well ... just a thought ... . rock n ' roll..
 `` g '' thank you so much ! last time be amaze ; remember when i ask `` be this why they call it the sing dune '' ? you just shut the top of ma beer ! lol there go the sound ... .
 dunestock 2009 ? be it happen or what ? when ? where ?
 heard that it be sth like 6th of nov ...
 a movie from south africa . an extraterrestrial race force to live in slum-like condition on earth suddenly find a kindred spirit in a government agent that be expose to their biotechnology . downloaded already : d
 i have it in my pc ; i be just about to start watch it . yes i also think it would be worth watch a imdb have give a rating of 8.9 ! ( out of 10 ! ) and it be currently the 78th best movie ever make ... so yea ; i 'll try to post later of how it go .
 the dutch team will likely find qatar to be a slight improvement ; but they 're probably the only one .
 qatar should be prepare 10 year from now to train it riot policeman and modernize it equipment in order to handle any bloody riot incident between fan of compete country of world cup 2022 .
 there do not seem to have be that much trouble in euro 2012 but the quality on the pitch have be good .
 safety be a factor that need to be maintain the russian be capable of create another fire ! ! ! wid all the vodka : d
 i doubt that many russians will travel to be honest . they be not know for travel in number and poland be about the closet tournament they be go to get ( apart from when they host the 2018 wc of course ) which i think we be a complete disaster !
 brute force and tyrant can stop this happening once in a while but not always and imagine what the world will be think about the tyrant in qatar who go about beating and brutalize football lover
 no they cant ... .
 hotels for ramadan hello ; i have some friend come to visit here in doha . i be wonder ; since they 're an unmarried couple ; if they will be able to share a hotel room ? if so ; could you please recommend . thanks
 no ; they have to live separately
 it depend on the nationality ! i think it ok if they be europen or americans . but if they be arabs it will not ganna work . but good you have to check with the hotel it self .
 no chance brother .
 and maybe we can suggest a price . sometimes they want `` special number '' that could remind them of the mobile ; birthday ; etc regards ! !
 it depends on the serial number of the car plate `` usually '' ; and sometimes if it 's 4 or 3 digit ; you can ask any car trader and they can give you the price ; maybe you can check the special auto newspaper .
 yeah a drsam said.. ask him how much he 'd pay you ( in a confident way ) and then double everything even the number plate change fee : p
 withhold applies only to company that have no entity in qatar . ( no commercial register ) i think it 's fair a those company do n't have expensis nor support the local economy .
 currently new law be put on hold ! suggest to check online at ministry of finance website for detail tax presentation and e & y or kpmg tax consultant for late update .
 you can not withold pay tax unless you be a 100 % qatari own company .
 dear salah ; my understanding be that withhold tax be applicable all the international transfer they do n't have a permanent establishment here . that mean if we be transfer fund to head office we should have withhold . please correct me if i be wrong . thanks
 new qatar income tax law hi friends ; i be work with an international company where the new income tax law be to be implement . could you please help me with the follow ? 1 ) how your company react to withhold tax thanks my blessings .
 dear victory ; i didnt know that ... ; let me check with e & y . they be also our auditors . anyway thank a lot for the replay .
 victory kindly give me the link of the website.please
 u should understand the difference between withhold and actual tax . as per the law which come in effect on 1/1/2010 ; for those company that be do work in the country without be register / do n't have cr/ the owner of the contract will withhold either 5 % or 7 % ( depend on the activity ) of the total payment on monthly basis . this amount will be pay to the tax authority before the 15th of the follow month . in my opinion ; this be to encourage foreign company to establish a base office in the country .
 dear salah ; is this 5 % withhold tax can be refund by non-resident company ? do you have idea when it come to filing and payment ? and where to file ? thanks in advance .
 thanks for your help stealth . i know i can count on you

 there be no specific provision on the labor law which state your claim unless there be an agreement between you and your company . the end of service gratuity be 3 week pay for every year of service . article ( 54 ) in addition to any sum to which the worker be entitle to upon the expiry of his service ; the employer shall pay the end of service gratuity to the worker who have complete employment of one year or more . this gratuity shall be agree upon by the two party ; provide that it be not less than a three-week wage for every year of employment . the worker shall be entitle to gratuity for the fraction of the year in proportion to the duration of employment . the worker 's service shall be consider continuous if it be terminate in case other than those stipulate in article ( 61 ) of this law and be return to service within two month of it termination . the last basic wage shall be the base for the calculation of the gratuity . the employer be entitle to deduct from the service gratuity the amount due to him by the worker .
 you need to have strong evidence to support ur case ... ask your friend if he/she want his father to be deport along with his partner . if find guilty he might have to serve a jail term before be deport ... . i dont think embassy will entertain such case . u can take help from the police .
 she should talk to his father ; to clarify this issue ; before anything else .
 father affair issue with other woman ; please help.. i have a friend whose father cheat with other woman . now we have evidence for their relationship . what should we do about it ? should we report to qatar police or our embassy ? if we report ; will they be deport from qatar ; lose job and must back to their original country ? what the best solution for this ... ? any ql member ; can give u idea.. thank you very much
 talk to your father ; tell him the fact ; and tell him to behave himself otherwise you and your sibling and your mother will disown him.make sure that he be not marry in secret ! .
 leave it to their family to make a decision .
 unless he be bang your ... ... . you have nothing to do with it ; and base on the fact that you be ask about this here in ql just prove the point that you be as dumb a you seem to be .
 thats quite a balancing act to be do by your friend before he need to report to the authority . lets suppose that your friend be totally dependant on his father to support his family financially then there will be no choice to loose him out . the best option be to talk to the father to advise him what he do be morally wrong and if he have a strong religious back ground ; than that would be an advantage to convince him out
 mind your own business and do n't interfere in other 's family matter .
 there 's always 3 side to a story - his side ; her side and reality . so ; a the others say - well let thing be sort out privately or the repercussion could be so much great ; affect you also . think further before you act .
 friendly speaking ; it 's good for you because you care for your friend . however ; you have to consider the consequence before make any action . you may worsen the situation or somewhat solve the problem . in my opinion ; a a friend do n't ever interfere on a family matter . perhaps ; you can advise your friend how to deal with it and solve the issue internally without involve the authorities.godbless
 buddy ; this be not ur life..u ca n't interfere in others life no matter how close u r to him/her..let ur frd to decide what he wan na do..
 just shut up .

 last i hear ( and from everything i have read about qatar ) be that officially stamp from israel in your passport be a big no-no . that say ; i do n't know that they check for it really -- maybe more bark than bite . the israeli trade office close in january ... `` most plain girl be virtuous because of the scarcity of opportunity to be otherwise . '' -- maya angelou
 you might get lucky and the stamp would be overlook ; but i would n't count on it . signature line > `` you ca n't fix stupid ''
 not a problem . mandi
 nothing be a problem until it get notice . just be prepare to be reject and on the next plane out if it be . signature line > `` you ca n't fix stupid ''
 the official position of qatar be that it be not a problem . mandi
 you will loose your money ; experience ;
 i saw at villagio carrofour where they sale the fresh flower
 besides this one ; do you know of any other place ; because it seem they be very expensive there .
 real christmas tree shopping does anyone know where we can buy a real christmas tree in doha ? thank you .
 i have be here for 3 year and have never see a live real christmas tree here . this be an islamic country you know ... they barely tolerate u celebrate our religious holiday ; i do n't think they be go to accept shipment of fir tree .
 sorry to say mikaylasmom .. but you can.. remember this be qatar not saudi
 i do n't think qatar mind you celebrate christmas . what be n't acceptable be the christmas celebrations and decorations which have invade our malls ; restaurants ; and lives . nothing big .
 you could find x'mas decoration at dreamz shop centre at the airport road . they have load and very reasonable .
 police clearance from country of origin and country of residence . having noc doesnt mean that he will be able to change job . that be at the hand of the immigration to approve or deny .
 i know all your friend ... tell which friend be leave our company ( ql ) ; ) btw ... . 1 . noc depends upon company 's hr policy . 2 . read labor contract and ensure competition clause be follow . 3 . police clearance certificate from respective embasssy . 4 . maximum number of transfer/s allow within qatar be three ( include the current one ) ... ..ensure that new job be really attractive ( financially ) and beneficial ( careerwise ) in the long run . all the best ; )
 victory why only 3 ? or be it 3 in one year ? or do they expect a person to work for only one `` master '' all his life ? what a gloomy future for employee ?
 jack that be the rule but not strictly enforce . it depend on the person and kind of job

 hiya ! im pretty sure you can but i 'll look when im in the supermarket ! happy move planning !
 baby milk formula my wife and i be move to qatar in the next few week and we have a 6 month old baby . we be comming from the uk and wonder whether or not we can get sma formula baby milk there ? if not then we be go to have to ship a few tin ! ! ! thanks leigh .
 i ' be work in one hypermart here in purchase dept but we really not have a sma milk . maybe leight even thou you can find some place here but it will be difficult . try to have alternate one for your angel ; ; < a href='http : //hunto.com ' > < img src='http : //i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg38/huntoo/msgraphics/z/zh974477.jpg ' border='0 ' title='make your space pop ! at hunto.com'/ > < /a > < br > < a href='http : //hunto.com ' > < img src='http : //i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg38/hun
 breast milk still best for babies ! ... hooyah !
 thanks hannah981
 right ; some people tell me you can get sma in megamart but it wasnt there today- thing be like that here - when they be they buy lot cos it may not be there again . in carrefour they have semilac ; nestle ; aptamil ; pediasure ensure and wyeth . on the sma website it link to wyeth- i dont know if they be make by the same company but apparently they be equivalent . if you google sma and the country it be in it direct you to wyeth for some country include qatar . these brand all seem to be readily available in the shop and be in a few different shop so should be easy to get hold of . if you research sma maybe it be the same a the wyeth ? ? if your little one have to have sma and the link with wyeth go nowhere then i would ship it but it 'll be fairly expensive . i guess the only alternative be to try to switch to something else thast you can get here gradually before you come so you dont have a mare when you get here ? wish you all the best with the move and the baby . my research be just testament to how bored i be a i have not yet find a job . i be also in healthcare and it seem hard for westerner to get those kind of job here !
 brian ; do u know this thread be post in the year 2009 ? ? so it mean that the person have already move in here..right ? ? ? it 's too late for ur reply buddy..

 convert if you believe in islam otherwise plenty of way to show that you care .
 he know i care . and he open to christianity . i dont really care about the religion aspect in relationship .. its not quite my forte
 get him . marry him . you convert or you dont convert thats upto you . < img src= '' http : //www.qatarliving.com/files/images/da.gif '' >
 do not convert to please people . religion be not about please people . its about pleasing god !
 i dont care about please people . i know i have the ability to please everybody ; it 's just if their worthy of be pleased or not be the question .
 because you dont deserve to be please by me .
 he have the right to ask you to convert and you have the right to accept or no . if a christian woman fall in love with a muslim man then they can marry and the muslim man should not force her . but really if you love him you should tell him that you be willing to know about islam ; then you can marry him and who know maybe you will convert . you can marry him and he should not force you at all .
 if you convert you will please yourself first and you may marry this man .
 relationship help i be a christian woman live here in qatar and i fell in love with a muslim man . he say that he do not care if i convert to islam or not ; but i feel that it would show that i truely care and love him if i do . what should i do ?
 anyways ; in true love ; religion should never be an issue ... boston be correct ; just show him that you really love and care . < a href= '' http : //photobucket.com/images/dragon % 20gif '' target= ''  '' > < img src= '' http : //i145.photobucket.com/albums/r202/mooncapsule/caro % 20perso/dragon-ball-z2049.gif '' border= '' 0 '' alt= '' dragon-ball-z % 20 ( 49 ) .gif pictures ; images and photos '' / > < /a >
 before you think of convert ; ask him first if he plan to marry you and ask him to let you meet his parent ... from that point you can think of convert or not < a href= '' http : //www.qatarliving.com/user/greentea '' > < img src= '' http : //lc.fdots.com/cc/lc/78/780fbc341ac46d9fc618695ae3c23eaf.jpg '' border= '' 0 '' alt= '' myhotcomments.com '' > < /a > < br > < a href=
 even if he plan to marry do n't mean that he be go to marry you !
 especially not ; when he be an egyptian !
 please do not revert for love ; marriage or friendship . if you want to convert into any religion ; take your time ; study about that religion ; once you satisfy yourself ; then you can proceed for revert to islam . otherwise dont do it ... . a your thread it be very well know that ; you be in deep love with him ... in my opinion religion doesnt matter at all ... wish you a successfull marriage life ...
 who say anything about be egyptian boston ? what would happen when a red quark and a green quark love eachother though ?
 be you crazy ! !
 he love you the way you be ; you do n't have to change a thing about you ! however ; i recommend to read about islam to get to know it ; even if you do n't convert ; you 'll learn how thing work for a good long-lasting relationship ! & i 'm happy for you ! ! ! real love nowadays be kinda rare to find ! ''twenty year from now you will be more disappointed by the thing you do n't do than by the one you do do . so throw off the bowline . sail away from the safe harbor . catch the trade wind in your sail . explore . dream . 'discover '' mark twain
 converting because you 're in love with the someone be not really a valid point . it be your belief and faith that should be the major factor why you want to convert . ok ; let 's say you convert to your bf 's religion : what if in the long run ; you guy break up ? you mean ; you will go back to your former religion ? what be bf do to prove his love for you ? jm28 ask you a question whether this bf have any plan of marry you . or maybe he 's just use you . be wise ... like they say ; love be blind . < a href= '' http : //www.glitter-graphics.com '' > < img src= '' http : //dl4.glitter-graphics.net/pub/789/789734c9hsuc4ab6.gif '' width=326 height=163 border=0 > < /a > < br > < a href= '' http : //www.glitter-works.org '' target= > < /a > < a href= '' http : //www.glitter-graphics.com '' > < i
 if he love you to be his wife that be alright religion do n't matter but before go in process of marriage u both have to understand each others cultural respect and make predecision of where u both have to live .
 relationship help i be a christian woman live here in qatar and i fell in love with a muslim man . he say that he do not care if i convert to islam or not ; but i feel that it would show that i truely care and love him if i do . what should i do ?
 azilana7037 well say
 on a serious note - ask yourself this question - is he worth it ? if yes ; it really do n't matter what you can or can not do to be with him . source : - a study conducted by friedunicorn - vol i ( september ; 1999 )

 fu ur previous avatar be well : )
 religion is not the big problem as long you love each other and both of you can understand the situation.respect both openion and belief thats it .
 pray to god for guidance and trust your heart . reflect on what marriage mean and give a thought to your future if you do not convert and have child . this seem to be the big problem in these relationship . you may both be secure in your individual faith ; but your child may suffer . sorry to bring in a down point ; just want to be a sincere advisor to you .
 does religion really matter to you then why at the first place enter into a relationship ! it be your personal call ... .mutually agree or compromise decide before marriage .
 i think you should convert to muslim or he should leave the muslim religion and convert to christian . it good to have the same religion with your partner in this way you will have the same faith .
 i have a new software rligion 2.012 issue 2009-2010 updated online freeware to convert from any religion to any other religon . you can find it on www.extremereligionconverter.com/marriagetomuslim yalla !

 mangal ... be n't it 2nd september for mr. gandhi ?
 no there be no hoildy on 2nd jan 2011 ... coz qatar be islamic country and islamic calender already start afew month ago..so an islamic country will not give a holiday for english calender .
 depends on the company.. as the 1st jan fall on a saturday most wo n't ; but again depend on your management
 brit and sanamjee it only my view point..it could be wrong or right
 arrest for fight in bar
 deportation if arrest while on a visiting visa ; be you definitly go to get deport ?
 maybe caught do illegal activity . then you will be deport and ban from enter doha again
 so do anyone know the answer ?
 stealth ; fight in bar be legal ?
 why dont you call 999 and confirm it yourself md ?
 i hate to wait ; stealth . and i have n't be in a bar since 15 year . do n't plan to go either .
 salimtoo ; ; ; short attention span ? or a spam ?
 it 's possible to stay in qatar for a long time ; but you have to behave .
 loool arien ! -- teach me rules ; i'll teach how to break it .. rms.. ! !
 let 's put it this way ; why would qatar want to retain a visitor who not only fight in bar but raise enough ruckus to get arrested fighting in bar ? i think they do n't want his kind here . mandi
 if you be on visit visa status and have be over stay in qatar problem be your passport might have be give to the cid by your agency ex . fahad ; cleopatra and evryday of lapse visa will be equivalent to a certain fine . they will ask you to pay a certain amount to get your passport so you can get back to your home country . if your question be arrest you in some criminal offense like carry dangerous alcohol ; drug etc . then yes you might be deported.in some case your relative or friend in doha will not even know you have be deport .
 labour law v contract fellas ; be in doha for a bit and might have an oportunity to relocate somewhere else for work reason . my contract be for 1 year and state 3 month notice period . looking into the labour law act it state that if i have work for less than a year in the companbject to 1 week notice ... would the labour law prevail over the contract or i will have to stick to the contract ? any help would be highly appreciate . best ; muthoid
 you have to follow the employment contract . the law will be follow if there be no provision for this subject . and also as long a the provision in the employment contract be not axactly unconscionably against the law ; then the employment contract should prevail .
 thanks amici for your reply ... but the point be that the law seem to say that less than 1 year = 1 week ! ? ! ? - you should never underestimate the predictability of stupidity -
 i agree with amici ... a u have already agree with the term of ur employment contract the time u join therefore ur empl contract should prevail.. ! ! !
 hmmm.. i dont have a contract with my employer.. on employment offer.. the notice be atleast a month or a week but you see ... they only give me few hours.. hows that ? ?
 it be accord to the contract . but remember ; if you have not complete two year in the country ; you can not change sponsorship .

 you should plan it very well so that you do n't waste any of your time there . search in the internet what place in paris would be very interesting for you . i suggest ; t he best place to view eiffel tower be in tocadero . try to find ; a map that will guide you on how to use the metro system in france . if you have plan of go to disneyland ; one day be n't enough if you have kid . i hope this be useful enough and enjoy !
 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah ! gay pareee ... what memory : )
 make sure you visit the catacomb ; which be underground tunnel stuff with human bomb . creepy ; but very interesting . notre dame be interesting ; but sacre couer be my favorite by far . if you 're not really into art then the lourve can prove to be an expensive waste of time . it 's huge ; and it can take you hour to find the stuff you really want to see . the musee d'orsay be a much small gallery with a much more focussed collection of impressionist masterpiece . get to know the metro system ; it be an amazing way to get around . the palais garnier be an underrated attraction . hopefully you can visit on a day that be operate tour . i really enjoy the restaurant in the marais area ; if you 're look for some place to eat .
 my husband & i go there for 2 day by train from switzerland ( part from our honeymoon ) . and i find out 2 day be enough and wo n't go there again . we 've stay at hotel plaza athenee ; which have a view of the eiffel tower . it be lovely & it be the same hotel that sarah jessica parker stay in in one of `` sex & the city '' episode . of course go on top of eiffel tower be great . and we go there early in the morning to avoid the long line . also : * louvre * arc de triomphe * versai palace * cathedrale notre-dame de paris * old down town paris * if you have kid 1 day in disneyland ; otherwise i do n't recommend it . * a walk in the champs-elysees street . which have number of cafe 's & restaurant . make sure to stand in the middle of the street & take picture of the arc de triomphe i always do a research on yahoo travel . there be lot of useful review and recommendation for hotel ; thing to do & restaurants . enojy in the cookies of life ; friends be the chocolate chips www.bastook.com
 have be to paris twice now . 1 . buy a guide book -- they have several at jarir or virgin . 2 . agree with above poster : a. sacre coeur good than notre dame . i also like saint chapelle better ; which be only about a block from notre dame . b. metro be fabulous c. lourve be huge ; just run to your favorite and skip the rest . d. i enjoy versailles ; especially the ground . e. eiffel tower line can be long or short depend on day and time . if super long ; then leave and come back later . f. walk around in the jardin de tuileries .
 deedee - agree with f. my dad die many year ago and the only flight i could get home be air chance . i spend a nice day there reflect with a nice ( and cheap ) bottle of wine : o ) < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/photos/b '' title= '' monotone mia by baldrick2dogs ; on flickr '' > < img src= '' http : //farm4.static.flickr.com/3389/3262305312 '' width= '' 240 '' height= '' 97 '' alt= '' monotone mia '' / > < /a >
 fs ; hiring tour be expensive . = (
 its almost the same if you take it from there also ... .or maybe 50-100 riyals difference . but it easy if you be not familiar with the city . i always prefer a guided city tour ... .then if you have more day you can explore yourself.. : ) < a href= '' http : //photobucket.com/images/funny '' target= ''  '' > < img src= '' http : //i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg12/n-a-t-a-s-j-a/funny/smile.gif '' border= '' 0 '' alt= '' smile pictures ; images and photos '' / > < /a >
 paris anyone ? my visa to paris be approve ! any tip ? good place to visit ? restaurants ?
 imtinan ; a guy who work for quicksilver in champ-lyses can give you a tour of paris . his name be mathieu bertrand ; and for me ; he 's one of the friendly parisians in town . if you have spare time ; party hard at the queen . le gay parie ! ; )
 they have moulin rouge bar/club in the cookies of life ; friends be the chocolate chips www.bastook.com
 monceau garden be also very nice ; but definetly stop to enjoy the tranquility of the luxembourg garden . they be splendid .
 and if you 're go shopping ; printemps on blvd haussmann have whole floor just for shoe and bag ! *********** `` there 's this thing call be so open-minded your brain drop out '' . - richard dawkins
 buy ticket for the hop-on/hop-off open top bus -you can get on and off as much a you want and there be 4 different tour route so you can see almost all of the best site for a reasonable price.i can recommend the royal magda hotel near the arc de triomphe- small but spotlessly clean . climb to the top of the arc de triomphe for a fantastic view of the champs elysses and paris-it 's good than the view from the eiffel tower . beware of pickpocket and scam artist particularly in the sacre coeur area . keep your wallet under your shirt next to your body.have a great trip . > may your dream take you travel all through your life .
 when arrive in paris you can take the air france shuttle bus into paris from the airport and it will drop off at the arc de triomphe where you can get ataxi to your accomodation.its cheap and safe than take a taxi or the metro. > may your dream take you travel all through your life .
 if you do take the metro from cdg ; have some coin with you because the ticket vend machine do n't accept note ; and the queue to the ticket counter can be very long .
 i recommend you visit louvre museum to see what napoleon have steal from egypt..very interest stuff though ... for food ; try noura restaurant for fine arabic food..two branch ; one in chapms elysee and the the other one off the opera station ... la defense be another nice place for walking and wonder about.. try also the latin square and the arabic cultural centre which have interesting history remarks..it be also close the the bastil ... eiffel tower be nice but do n't climb it if you have height phobia..surroundings be enough beauty.. do n't go to pigale area at night..it becomes unstable.. i be sure you hear of de triumph arch so do n't miss it..you can get up to it top..nice for fotos.. have a safe journey..

 paris anyone ? my visa to paris be approve ! any tip ? good place to visit ? restaurants ?
 few more tip ; if you still have n't travel yet . for music visit : palais garnier . for shopping and reasonably price souvenirs visit : lafayette and rue de la huchette ( this old street have lot of yummy shawerma ) curiousbutdetermined on the louvre : `` see what napoleon have steal from egypt '' ; the same applies to the british museum ; it contain the large egyptian antiquity collection ; confiscate by the british army back in the day . novi : remember this ? you have u fool for a while..lol http : //www.qatarliving.com/node/92952 salam
 je vois que ce n'est pa necessaire de visiter paris si vous ne parler le francais .
 paris favorites : eating ; drinking and shoopping.no ; sure not that all limit when the place be paris.do not by pas visiting muse de la mode ( 10 ; avenue pierre ier de serbie ) the museum be a treasure trove of fashion from the 18th - 20th century ; it would be a great off the beaten path stop for a trip to paris and some other tip for you ; tip # 1 for paris - if you be in paris drive a car ; be aware that people in paris drive however they want to . tip # 2 - if you have a car ; get a good tourist book which will tell you where and where not to park . tip # 3 - learn a bit of french . a great book which have a lot of basic phrase and fun thing to try be rick steves ' handy pocketbook guide to basic french ( find book ) tip # 4 - use the metro ( the subway ) . there be simply no good way to get around paris . but make sure you 've brush up on your french . it will help with buy ticket and understand the map in the subway . tip # 5 - the line and crowd at the eiffel tower can get very long . if you must see the light of paris at night ( and you should ) go on a week night ( not friday ) ; or make reservation . tip # 6 - the louvre . from what i understand ; if you be an art lover and really appreciate art museum ; you could spend week there ; but for most people ; half a day be enough time . you see the famous picture ( mona lisa ) ; and spend some time look at the amazing art . if you go on sunday morning and get there a they 're open ; it 's free admission . tip # 7 - if there be one place that be absolutely crazy to drive in paris ; it 's in the roundabout that go around the arc d'triomphe . if you rent a car and drive here ; just go travel around in your car like you would if there be no rule . tip # 8 - there be lot of wonderful museum in france ! one of them be the pantheon ; which be originally a church ; and originally plan to be something other than that .victor hugo and some other famous french people be bury there . make sure you set aside some time and some money to visit the museum if that 's something you want to do . tip # 9 - have some small change ( or large change if you can afford it ) on hand for the street performer . they 're pretty good ! tip # 10 - if you like look at the inside of church ; take some time for notre ' dame ; and if you have a problem with crowd ; do n't go on the weekend . people be pretty respectful inside the cathedral on the weekday ; but there be a lot of people there on the weekend ; so you end up wait in line ; and it get more noisy inside . tip # 11 - if you want to see the eiffel tower light up and sparkle at night ; get there right before the hour . tip # 12 - if you see a person on the street who be sell something and want to sketch you or give you something for free ; do n't be fool by talk which say they 'll so something for free . it is n't free !  < b > attitudes be more important than fact ... < /b >
 happy happy ... why do i fool you guy ? ? ? i be ask the tip about go to paris before our summer hols . and we go to paris last summer : )
 bastok why wouldt you want to go to paris again ? it such a great city . i go to there 3 time and still dont have enough of it . it one of my favorite city in europe . onece i go a a single with friend on the tgv .

 if you have drive liciense ; you can purchase car without any letter from your sponsor.to get the liciense you already have get the letter to submit in the driving school ; now u r entitle to own a car ; go ahead ; wish you all the best .
 u need an noc from ur sponsor ; even if u have a driving licence .
 buying a personal car i be plan to purchase my own car and will buy a second hand unit on cash basis . being an expat how should i go with the process . do i still need to get a letter from my employer allow me to purchase my personal car . appreciate much to anyone that could give me some idea and feedback . thank you
 1 . select a car of ur choice . 2 . take it to computer check . 3 . once u r satisfy with the test ; negotiate the price . 4 . go to muroor with the letter from ur sponsor ; id card ; qr250 and the owner of the car ; to transfer it to ur name . take an atm or credit card a they do n't accept cash . muroor have type centre ; where u will type the form in arabic ; with ur detail and car .
 we too have a secondhand car..first thing we do be ; request an noc from our sponsor since this be need when we have the process of car transfer ; photocopy of id 's ... just make sure the car you be buy be in very good condition and the insurance or istimara be valid for another ( 3-6 mo ) ; 1 year be well . that way you have ample time to have it check or no more cash be go out of your pocket for repair . one more thing..check if the car have any traffic violation before the transfer that way the first owner will pay it..on our case we just find out day after that the car have violation on the same day we get the car ... too bad for u ( we try to request for photo ) to check if it 's really our car but the police ca n't present any proof cause it 's a parking violation and it 's the mobile police who note it . we pay it & we do n't want to argue anymore..just have it on the wrong time ; the violation be make in a place we never visit and the owner of the car already leave the country . anyway goodluck on your new car .
 yes ; baldrick2dogs be correct . i ask them the same thing and receive the same answer .
 i be be cancel before then recently come back to doha . after i inquire with my previous bank ; they give me the same bank account a my previous one . same thing with q-tel ; i apply for new connection and still they ask me to pay my outstanding bill which be under my id number ( i do not pay before my arrears since it be just less than 300 qr ) . therefore ; they will not cancel your account even if your work visa be cancel .
 they do n't have time to update/ cancel the a/c 's of left people coz..they be run with short of time to give proper in time service to the exist costomers .
 i agree with yoiu that they dont update the data . but dont force me to beleive they give excellent service to exsitng customers.. it be a matter of technology how to be use . if yoiu go out of your country after visa cancellation without repay the loan ; how they catch you at airport ? ... . so if they want to update data ; they do it ;
 i think it be osn
 def osn ; they have start advertise it ! ! ! carn the all blacks ! !
 which channel of osn exactly will be show this ? thanks
 ok thanks . just a bit confused a i be look at which tv package to get and be look at the package deal that the qtel shop be offer . they only seem to include `` show sport 2 ; 3 and 4 '' a part of the osn package ; even on the osn premier plus package ? ! can you recommend somewhere where i can get the channel that include the rugby world cup ? thanks a lot .
 rugby world cup aybody know who have the tv right for the rugby world cup in september ? al jazeera or osn ?
 any recommendation on which tv package to get and where from to get the rugby world cup be appreciate . thanks .
 if you get the osn package ( sports ) it include all sport chanels 2 ; 3 and 4 ... .get the hd box if you can then you 'll get the hd chanel which be show the wc game in hd ... if not it still be show on 2 ; 3 and 4 .
 thank you for your answer . where do you buy the hd box and package from in doha ? i go to the qtel store in the villagio ( they could n't tell me any detail ; just give me a list of package they do ) ; but there must be some other shops/places that sell it ?
 i get mine from star link in city centre ... .if you want to get the hd chanels then you need the osn box..
 i know that : if ur company accepts and not ask u for money ; u dont have to pay ; but if they tell u they will not accept to end ur work with them they will ask u and u should give them money ; but here in qatar i think that u dont have to pay them if they still want u to work with them and they wil ask u for money thats if u come in ur hasbund visa
 it 's possible to resign from the job within contract period . well ; this depend upon what your contract say . if your contract specify that `` if you resign before agreed period then the expense occur ( for your training ; visa ; ticket etc . ) would be bear by you '' . then yes ; you have to pay the company expense .
 i have receive the appointement letter but not contract . and it be not sign by the ministry . so the contract be valid or not ?
 im apply for a job in qatar last month under one agency get this job in poea workabroad online job hiring.my agency tell me ill wait for 1 week or a 2 it true ?
 case to case it depend on your employer i get mine after 2.5 month [ img ; adopt & overcome|desc=|link=none|align=left|width=180|height=135 ]
 i have be here last three month
 lego blocks where can i find/buy lego blocks here in qatar ? tried toys r us ; villagio ; city center and landmark but to no avail .
 unfortunately qatar be an undeveloped country . 'good ' thing be not in great demand . they rather go for cheap rubbish here .
 i have to buy mine online from amazon and have them ship in . signature line > `` you ca n't fix stupid ''
 almost every month i visit there and they sell legos ! original legos ! never forget to ask the salesperson over there ! `` everything in this book may be wrong . '' illusions : the adventures of the reluctant messiah by richard bach
 heero ; i think op refer to the just block ... plain block ; not the one in the box building starwars ship or truck ...
 in the hallmark store in the mall - pink and blue plastic tub with maybe 250 piece set inside . but i end up have a friend who be visit bring some back from denmark . but i second what marycatherine say : order them online and ship them in . doha be not a place that you depend upon for anything to be in stock anywhere . i wish i could drink like a lady . i can take one or two at the most . three and i 'm under the table . four and i 'm under the host '' -- dorothy parker
 i have a whole bunch of old set that i bring with me when i come . will put them up for sale soon a i do n't fancy ship them back .
 be wonder if your old lego toy be already on sale ; coz be interested . cant find lego block here in doha .
 if it a 2nd hand car your talk about ; then do not go to the bank . go to finance company ; like jazeera finance or first finance . they have much good rate & the model of the car do n't matter .
 thanks for info i be the seller and i just want to know when i will get my payment ; what be payment process ?
 your car be thru car loan and you want to sell it ? the buyer must pay first ; then you go to the bank to pay the car loan amount ( full ) ; ask for the clearance from the bank for the full payment of the car loan . ( 2days ) once you have the clearance ; you can proceed to traffic dept . for the transfer of ownership ( seller and buyer ) .
 use car loan do anybody know process of used car loan ? banks be pay directly to dealer ? if yes ; where be the guarantee for seller ? be dealer pay to seller after transfer the registeration of car to buyer ? i be plan to sell my car but confuse about the process
 if you have a buyer already and he/she want to pay your car from a bank loan ? he should first go to a car dealer ; he will get a quotation from them ( qr1000 fee ) ; take it to the bank . bank will give him the money ; he then pay you . after receive the payment you can give him you car.of course he will do all the transfer of ownership procedure .
 thanks for useful info ; the buyer want to buy my car via car loan ( commercial bank ) ; and the bank ask from buyer to bring the quotation from dealer which we provide already now ; that be ok but bank be tell that they will make the payment to dealer directly and than i will get my money from dealer ; be it correct ? i dont understand this part in case dealer do not want to pay it to me ; where be my guarantee ?
 if you look at the reverse ( back ) of your car registration card ; at the right hand bottom you will see a column 'type of ownership ' in arabic nough almukia . if you have your bank name write there ; you can not sale this car without a no objection letter from the bank .
 yes ; you can sell your car . you have to take the buyer of your car to the bank and settle all your remain amount in the bank plus pay you if the total price of the car beyond or high than the remain amount in the bank . after that process do ; the bank will give out noc to you for you to hand over the noc to the new buyer for him to process with the traffic police department to change the ownership . you have to go along with the new buyer to the insurance company to change the ownership before proceed to the traffic police department for change the ownership and renewal of the registration card . cheers..
 dann be correct . you can either go to the registration dept first if the buyer feel un-secure and then go to the insurance company second . but first you must go to the bank along with you buyer to clear the outstanding amount before proceeding . if buyer have an account in the same bank ; then bullseye ! your task be much easy .
 you can ask good question than that . < img src= '' http : //www.qatarliving.com/files/images/da.gif '' >
 if it be like my site ; you will not be allow to connect your personal laptop to the company internet connection . this be how virus spread like wildfire . < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/photos/b '' title= '' the pearl development panorama by baldrick2dogs ; on flickr '' > < img src= '' http : //farm4.static.flickr.com/3351/3615935822 '' width= '' 240 '' height= '' 57 '' alt= '' the pearl development panor

 your old passport must have be cancel when you renew it . nobody be allow to travel with cancelled or expired passport . you can give an allowance of at least one hour to transfer your rp to your new passport . the payment of that transaction be qatari riyals 110 .
 you can travel with both passport ; just because your old passport be cancel doe n't make your rp cancel . i have the same issue last year and just show my rp in my old passport to immigration ; this be n't a problem ... but arrange to have it transfer as soon a you can
 you have transfer to the new passport ; which will not take much time .
 i agree with raven1968 ; take both when you travel ; you will be fine in the way back .
 habibmdh you dont have to ; it advisable you do ... i be travel with my rp in my old passport for 4 month before my rp be renew in my new passport ; never once have a problem at immigration
 raven be correct - i have travel with both passport ... a the rp have n't expire
 working visa require an exit permit to travel outside the country whereas family visa do not require any exit permit . to apply for an exit permit ; a person need a valid passport ; not passports . i suppose raven and oryx be hold family visa .
 where be this do ? can a person do it on they own or do the company have to do it for them ?
 since windows 7 be just be release i would say `` do not install it yet '' and wait some time until you can get some feedback from those already use it . i know there be a way to have more than one os in the hd and to have the pc/laptop ask you with which os you want to start ; but in this case someone with more knowledge should give you a hand on that . i guess it be relate to partition the hd and install each os in each partition available ; thus it have to be a high capacity hd . regards ! !
 somebody enlighten me pls.. dear ql 's ... . i have aoa 150 netbook with window xp instal when i buy it ; i like to try window 7 ; i want to know if in case i dont like window 7 can i install window xp back ; the original one which i 'm suppose to replace ? or i can have them both install in my netbook without any problem ? help plsss ; ; ; thanks in advance .
 well normally you get a back up disk which you can use to reinstall your original window that come with your netbook ; but sometimes it kept in a un accessable location on say your second partition . so first confirm that . to answer your question yes you can install window 7 and have xp if you install them on two separate partition . you dont want dual operate system on your netbook then go ahead and just install win7 you can always downgrade later without any problem ; provide you have your xp cd : )
 appreciate that ; ; ; thanks .
 guy i only have this mini netbook ; it do n't come with cd ; so how can i install it back ? and how to do the partition you be say ? sorry ; dnt know much about lap..thanks again .
 thanks smoke ; ; ; i appreciate that .
 better if you just stick with xp a minipc be design for if you like to try window 7 then upgrade your pc to high one sell it and buy new . c ; ) cheer ! ! !

 nix ; qatar have 563 km of coastline . take a 4-wheel drive and explore it . go for camp in the desert and enjoy silence and million of sparkle star undisturbed from the city light .

 depends on your living style ; doesnt seem very good for a family ...
 this salary be absolute minimum for you to even sponsor your family . the school fee will completely use it up . what be you offer a a housing allowance ? mandi
 got offer from qatar i live in canada well i like to know house rent in qatar per month and also school fee for kid i have zone 5 year and daughter 3 year old . i get offer 10k per month plus family status housing allowance +transport be this package good to move qatar i really appreciate for your advice sameer
 i agree with mandi ; without child and with a decent housing allowance the offer may be ok . but once school fee come into the equation i do n't know if the offer would be any use to you .
 it more than enoguh.. you should look at all the poor ppl in the world and thank god for this offer and make sure u giev 2.5 % of ur saving a charity every year
 i think it should be 10k us dollar for canadian national . but if 10k qar then problem for you man ... ... .. can not be survive with kid and family and schooling ... ... ... ... ..
 10k with kid ! no way near enough !
 us10k per month for technical support ? i do n't think so ... it be most likely qr10k check be the company pay school fee - education be expensive here ; so with qr10k per month it would be difficult .
 i dont even think this be anyway near close to a family salary in qatar . honestly i 'd say stay in canada if be talk about 10kqr because basically be say about 3kcd or maybe a bit up or down ( not sure about the rate at the moment ) . whats your job description ? and what company have offer you ?
 i really thank you guy for really great advice here what i get offer yesterday salary 10.000qr+ housing 7000 + convence1000 yearly ticket 21 day leave with family medical so be this good offer or not . appreciate for you advice
 hi sameer how be you ? well share my experience ; i would say 10k be less ; try to locate the major expenditure ; like doctor ; school ; or even include atleast once in a week dinner at some good place ; buy a car and then it maintenance ; if you ask me i would recommend you to negotiate with them for atleast 15k with house allowance ; or ask them to provide company maintain car and family medicle ; i be sure you must have good credential ?
 thanks guy for your advice i will check with the company if they agree then ok other wise allah kareem bcos my concern to move down to qatar have one reason to be close of my parent long time i do ; t visit them and have advantage free ticket every year ... . i really thank all of you sameer

 from thur or sunday depends
 depends on the management ; generally and a per labour law it be three work day start from the first day of eid ; management of each company can extend it a per their policy
 according to my secret agent it 's friday ; saturday ; and sunday . make sure your company give you sunday off !
 plus the 26th and 27th - so it 's 5days holidays !
 as per labour law it be 3 work day and if you be not work normally on saturdays then it will be possibly from friday to tuesday . if you be normally work on saturdays it will be from friday to monday . some companies follow the labour law but there be a lot of private companies give only one or two day .
 `` as per labour law it be 3 work day . '' is that the law ? then i will insist on sunday . monday ; and tuesday off ; and i will take wednesday and thursday ; too ; because it make no sense to come in for two day . thanks ; cherukkan .
 salaam ; why ca n't you raise this with the management ; ; may be they be wait for the employee to ask for it ?
 when be eid holiday for private company ? does any one know which day will be public holiday for non-government ?
 this be a decision take by the govermment and google wo n't help because the government do n't publish thing like this . i know because that 's the first thing i try .
 report : eid holiday to start oct. 25 ; public sector to close for 10 day read more : http : //dohanews.co/post/33632902191/report-eid-holidays-to-start-oct-25-public-sector-to # ixzz29ocfh1pr
 i be work in a private company run many institutions.i would like to know if there be rule in qatar labour law which state that if i take leave for 1 day due to personal reason on sunday i can join only on saturday loose 6 day of salary for 1 day leave ; they also reduce house allowance of six day since i be on leave for six day . please any one can guide me about which law the management be follow . with regard dream team
 all the major car company chrage the same here unless you have gcc coverage
 i import prado from dubai an year ago and toyota dealer ask the same . i be take the vehicle to tayseer service station and they be excellent . you can actually monitor what technician be do . make sure that he follow the maintenance schedule . even if you flush the engine ; change japan make oil filter and use mobile 10 ; 000 km oil it will not cost more than 300 qr where a in toyota ; the same with 5000 km oil will cost around qr 800 1000 . go to salwa road tayseer and get the vehicle service in less than 2 hr . in toyota dealer it will take not less than one entire day .
 just notice you say your car be one year old . for sure it be under warranty so check with toyota dubai to see if your warranty be valid at any toyota dealer which it should be . it be possible that the story i relay to you be in fact i believe either toyota or bmw . if your warranty be valid i would definitely go to the proper authority at the ministry of economy and commerce and report the toyota dealer . make them service your vehicle under the condition of the warranty you agree to . believe me they know what they be do and they know it be wrong but yet they still try to bend the condition to their liking . make them honor the rule they have the responsibility to uphold . i be sure for every car they have to service from outside qatar there be one that leave they dont have to .
 in addition to complain to the ministry ; send a complaint to toyota-japan ; i 'm sure they do n't accept such crooked practice ; and if they do ; never buy a toyota again .
 other than american car none of the other car be provide ggc-wide warranty . check your document . if you dont have gcc wide warranty then there be nothing much even the ministry can do and neither will toyota hq do anything about it .
 teyseer may be ok for routine oil change ; filter etc - but in know toyota have a service checklist for a certain odometer reading . are there garage in qatar that can do this type of service .mine be a fortuner import from bahrain . i be near 40k on the odo . i would like to take it to a garage that do the proper job - if any one know such a place . rg

 c'mon rebel ; do you flush your brain in the tb ? i be not a celebrity ; yet .
 thet be lonely ... ..the person who be rite at the top be always lonely . they may have the money the fame the look but at the end of the day they be lonely soul ... ...
 the person on top be always lonely ? ? ? ?
 jpa ... start takin drug u will be a celebrity one day : p
 ha.ha . ha . ; very funny rebel . i 'll do that at the end of yesterday .
 why some celebrity be hook to drug ? they have the fame ; money and almost everything and yet they be on drug abuse . what do you think be the factor that drive them to become addict ?
 brit - naughty naughty ... . : - ) read the rest of my post ... . it explain it ... : - )
 becoz they be not happy at all !
 it be mainly because of the people they associate with . in america we call them `` hangers-on '' or `` yes men '' . they 're the one that provide these celebs with the drug . once you start do the drug you become addicted . think about it ; it 's not the celebs go to the ghetto look for the drug ; it 's the enablers that bring them to the celebs .
 it not just now ; it be go on through 20-30 year just press be find thing out alot easy with the help of modern day technology .
 @ jpa ; here 's a reality check mate ... do you smoke cigarette ? do you drink coffee ? do you drink alcohol ? ... nicotine ; caffeine & alcohol be all drug ; they 're just legal ; socially acceptable one ... as for illegal drug ; millions of people around the planet do it ; but the press be n't interested in those people 'cos they 're not famous ... celebrity be hound by the press so you get to read about every aspect of their life & that include illegal drug use ; that 's all ...
 thanks for your comment gadarene ; but do you answer my question ?
 because sleep be not an option ... ..they have to stay awake ...
 maybe due to family problem ; pressure and be curious about the effect of drug .
 u want to know why im not use drug ? ? ? because i 'm over confidence . another celebrity they be not confidence so thats why they use drug to increase their confidence.. same like one man smoke it mean he be not confidence ; so he take one cigarret and he burn it then he will think he will be macho man infront of another people..
 cerape ; yeah ; every time i take a drag from my ciggie i feel super macho . yeah ! ! ! and then i be confidence .
 why some celebrity be hook to drug ? they have the fame ; money and almost everything and yet they be on drug abuse . what do you think be the factor that drive them to become addict ?
 be about to say exactly the same thing ; -p
 cerape ; if you can handle a really manly man ... .. : /
 nomerci be that your first virtual date request from a celebrity ? watch it girl you be get young every day ! wink.. : )
 lol nomerci.. : )
 @ jpa ; you do n't get my point mate ... why be anyone hook to drug ? ... there be way more regular people than celebrity hook to drug ... & the reason for that addiction be multiple ... some of those same reason apply to your celebrity a well ... l we forget ; they be still very much human ... so really your question be ; why be people hook to drug ? ... google that one mate ; plenty of info . available ...

 i suggest you brush your pet more often . wet the brush first then the hair will stick to the brush .
 there be really not special vacuum cleaner available in the market . it be really not advisable to vacuum clean your cat .you have to be very cautious while do so a you may scare the cat by the noise and sometime by the accidently stick your cleaner to the cat skin ( it really scary for the pet ) . instead you brush you pet everyday this will help to clean as well a massage the skin by increase the circulation of blood . brush also help to find out the skin affection if any still you want one -- buy any small low power/speed hand hold portable vacuum clean .look for the small portable one . hope this will help

 i saw one alienware laptop at virgin megastore in villagio . you may look for some dell resellers .
 very rarely see in qatar .
 saw alot of alienware in dubai last week !
 suggest you build your own spec and order directly from the us . even if you find any alienware in qatar the spec would be limit . i have some friend who directly order from the us a they do not like the spec available here . it be mere basic and super expensive a always . best of luck .
 actually that 's what i have in mind ; but my concern be do dell ship to qatar ? how exactly do your friend receive their laptop ?
 i have be look for an hp i7 ; dv6 3175 past two month ; this great country doesnt have them . you get it in any kiosk in dubai . gr8 qatar
 let 's say my customization add up to 3000 $ ; if custom be at 5 % then that would make 150 $ ; so why 700 $ ? and ca n't i order directly from dell ?
 alienware in qatar ? ? hello everybody ; i be just wonder if there be any alienware resellers here in qatar a i plan on purchase a new laptop ; and so far i ca n't seem to find any . any help would be very appreciated ; thanks in advance !
 i think you be confuse ; any item import to qatar more than 700 usd have around 5 % tax . but obviously before ship you good call aramex or dhl and confirm them the actual invoice amount so they can confirm to you . regarding dell ; i be not sure but on amazon and bestbuy you have ton of alien ware on sale .
 oh ok get it ; i misunderstand you the first time ; i think that i have to pay 700 $ of tax . thank you very much for your help i really appreciate it . one last question ; do you have any idea how much to expect for the shipping ?
 i know someone sell his alienware comp with full accessory ...
 i have one ... different spec from the one in virgin villagio ...
 do you have detail of the full spec and what condition it 's in ?
 found a link from another site for someone sell an alienware laptop ; http : //www.qatarsocial.com/thread-4768-1-2.html . just think you may want to check it out .
 thanks a lot for the post ! only problem be there be no contact number ; and i ca n't pm since i only just create an account on that website ; so all i do be reply to his post ; hope it 's still available and at a good price
 get your own customize from alienware : ) it worth the wait !
 i saw a beautiful alienware laptop in the virgin store at landmark last saturday - i have no idea of the price ; i just know i ca n't afford it !
 do you know which alienware it be ? 11 ; 15 or 17 inch ?
 alienware in qatar ? ? hello everybody ; i be just wonder if there be any alienware resellers here in qatar a i plan on purchase a new laptop ; and so far i ca n't seem to find any . any help would be very appreciated ; thanks in advance !
 get it custom make and at half the price ! go for it !
 well i really wan na go for it ; but ( you might not be aware of this ) since late january intel have recall all it new sandy bridge chipsets which the new alienware m17x-r3 be equip with ; so production of this model have be stop ever since ; and it 's due to be resume early march hopefully ; so until then my hand be tie !
 you will find it in virgin megastore there lot alienware model there . price be i guess 13000 ; 26000 ; 6000 +
 do n't buy it locally ; either go to dubai and get one there or buy it online and ship it through aramex . all the alienwares you 'll find here will be outdated or super expensive . but even if you buy it online ; for good spec you 're look at 2000- $ 2500 exclude aramex fee . buy an msi instead ; they 're fairly cheap and look cool . or if you 're willing to buy online check sager . i buy one recently and it 's be work like a charm .

 i be with polygamy - yes as a woman ; i would only like one husband..
 can you vote on this topic please ? are you with polygamy or no ? as a woman would you like to have one husband or two ?
 i have enough kid thanks ; ) smile lot laugh more
 how about from man side ? only one woman ?
 having one hubby be such a headache ...
 no ! ! ! ! !
 i know of a sect in india which practice polyandry marriage ie ; all the brother share one wife.. it help them to keep the stability of the family and it asset ! now bck 2 the topic..if the heart can accommodate more than one true love and b true to all.. then why not ! ! !
 dna must test both child and father it mean 3 test
 im totally against the double trouble
 keiko san : berreman ; gerald d. pahari polyandry : a comparison american anthropologist february 1962 vol.64 ( 1 ) :60 74 . see fourth article at : http : //www.publicanthropology.org/archive/aa1962.htm
 polygamy ? ... maybe ; it 's okay if the man be polygamous but not the woman ; they should be loyal to their husband only .
 golden rule : `` dont do to ur wife if you dont want her to do the same thing to you . '' ~ this summarize everything . ^^
 can you vote on this topic please ? are you with polygamy or no ? as a woman would you like to have one husband or two ?
 why not ; forget the bird ; take a lesson from the bee !
 personally i would not go for it or allow my husband to do it . however ; i would support others right to it ; if it 's what they truly want .
 i would say cause we 're live in the year 2009 we need to be more openminded about this stuff . the defintion of marriage be no longer 1 man and 1 woman ; and family no longer mean 1 husband ; 1 wife and 2.5 kid . there be lot of different type of marriage & family ; and who be we too judge what 's right and what 's wrong if they be all consenting and happy ?
 yup ; and that 's why there should be law prevent marriage until the age of 18 . in most western country there be .
 i recommend 2 enough for a woman . i mean ; one from the front ; and one from the back.. '' at any one time '' polygamy ... yes if you have the strength of a horse to conquer 4 mountain per night .
 i see no issue with it as long a they be both consent .
 yes sure ... ... .and this 'consenting ' be happen how many percent of the time ?
 i refuse to believe any 19 - 25 year old lady would volunteer to marry a 45 to 55 year old guy . this would be highly exceptional and not common . further more it be immoral . impregnating woman at a young age take away their possibility of proper education/development and such . one hell of a way to keep female 'low ' .
 no ... ..one only . one at a time mean ... ... avoid sleep with both at a time . aana free ; jaana free ; pakde gaye tho khana free .
 i know a couple of woman who 've marry much old men ; and agree readily to it . they find old men to be more finacially stable and mature . it be n't the way i would have choose ( obviously ) but it 's what they want .
 can you vote on this topic please ? are you with polygamy or no ? as a woman would you like to have one husband or two ?
 they should not affect the society or community .
 everything you do affect those around you ; as long a you be n't hurt anyone ; who care ?
 one husband be enough trouble for me . methinks.. two would be a man- make disaster ; like chernobyl : - ) usapa na ...
 i do n't think i could manage a trois : o )
 for all of the pro-polygamist out there.. i mean one man and more than one wife.. one serious question . can a man in a polygyny ( one man have more than one wife ) ; marriage ; share a bed with two of his wife at the same time ? like a threesome ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - he who dares wins
 all i know ... i want polyguiness . to the harp ! ! ! !
 so what be the difference between polyandry and poly laundry ? is it wet cleaning and dry cleaning ? ===================================== http : //www.qatarliving.com/node/58409
 khalid ; if you be one of those two husband ; do you 'll accept thta the second guy sleep with your wife ?
 is it tree-some ? ===================================== http : //www.qatarliving.com/node/58409
 i do n't see why men find it so difficult to accept another man sleep with their wife ; while we woman be suppose to accept our husband sleep with another woman .
 can you vote on this topic please ? are you with polygamy or no ? as a woman would you like to have one husband or two ?
 competition bring out excellence ...
 polygamy ca n't be wrong . the great kings do it .
 having know woman involve in polygyny i find it really sad to see the toll it take on their self-esteem and the way their husband play one off against the other to gain `` top spot '' . i realize that not all polygynous marriage be like that ; but all i have know be . also ; outside of religion i have to agree with gypsy . if it be suppose to be so easy for a woman to accept her mate sleeping with someone else ; then men should be able to handle it too . the fact that you know you can not ; show you know it also present a serious hardship on woman -- even if it be `` allowable '' accord to religion or law . < strong > i refuse to drink the kool-aid ! < /strong > -- < em > pm < /em >
 before you post about something be allowable in islam you should really do your research carefully ; rather than just take one person 's word for it . the only firm requirement be that the man be fair among his wife with regard to time and money spend . and one can not exceed have 4 wife at a time . < strong > i refuse to drink the kool-aid ! < /strong > -- < em > pm < /em >
 women hat share ; but men like it don t you ? ? ? as a men would you like to share you wife ? ? ! ! !
 more thought on polygamy : ... ... ... . koran or quran noble verse : sura 4:3 http : //www.submission.org/suras/sura4.htm ... ... ... .. http : //www.answering-christianity.com/polygamy.htm
 and what we know be that base on the quran and hadith a muslim man be allow to have up to 4 wife provide he can support them equally and divide his time equally . a muslim woman have the right to choose not to be in a polygynous marriage and she can divorce a husband who choose this against her wish . muslims feel that polygyny be a right grant by allah and although it may not be advisable to exercise every right ; a man who be hell-bent on have more than one wife will do so ; use his religious right to do so . i 'm not really sure what you be try to add here or get at with these link but believe me ; this have be discuss endlessly and i seriously doubt anybody will change their mind . if you be interested in islam i would suggest you find a good imam near you to talk to . many of the internet site can lead you down the wrong path ( submission.org be one of them ) . < strong > i refuse to drink the kool-aid ! < /strong > -- < em > pm < /em >
 but maybe it be different for girl because i do not see sex a a sport and do not like the notion of compete with another woman when my heart be involve . i really ca n't relate to what you be say here . perhaps the painful reality of so many polygynous marriage hit too close to home to me . in fact ; i would think that islamic polygyny when practice properly ( if there be such a thing ) be not suppose to make the woman feel in competition with each other . i always think it place a tremendous burden on men to make sure they be not hurt their wife/wives and make each feel special in her own right -- not compare to the competition . i do n't think most men be able to fulfill that role and i expect to see a lot of `` paralyzed '' men on the day of judgment . moreover ; i think it show a lack of faith that so many take the matter so lightly . it seem to me they be live for earthly pleasure with no concern about accountability . < strong > i refuse to drink the kool-aid ! < /strong > -- < em > pm < /em >
 but only use it a a perspective through which to view american culture . no . it be cruel for a man to make such a competition between his wife . the same cruelty happen between unmarried people through dating ; flirting ; etc . it also occur when someone be flaunt wealth . whatever intentionally provoke negative feeling that harm a person 's contentment and inner peace be a sort of cruelty . this be the reason for the hijab ; and also for the prohibition ( only for men ) of wear gold or silk . part of what i want to make noticed be how much of contemporary western consumer society be center around the drive to provoke such feeling - lust ; envy ; jealousy ; etc . in others about one 's self . the `` if you get it ; flaunt it '' mentality . that people in the west be now so addict to this game ; be the reason why they react in such horror at the idea of hijab ; especially ; a if it nullify any reason for a woman to live if she do not strut her stuff . so i be only try to see polygamy through the competition lens to make a point about this cultural trend .
 i have witness jealousy ; envy ; greed and materialism on a scale i never know exist in the west . it really be a shock to my system and while i might have find it curious in the beginning ; i now see it a so un-godly it 's hard to even believe you be in the heart of islam . maybe you have n't be here that long . it would be interesting to see how you feel after 10 year . < strong > i refuse to drink the kool-aid ! < /strong > -- < em > pm < /em >
 can you vote on this topic please ? are you with polygamy or no ? as a woman would you like to have one husband or two ?
 and unique in be the wealthy nation in the world . it would not be scientific ; to say the least ; to take observation of qatar ; and use that a a measure stick to judge all of arabs and muslims ; much less islam . first ; a a muslim you know yourself that there be a wide gap between the ideal of islam ; and the current state of muslims . and to spend too much breath defend ourselves a we actually be would be a waste except when it be in defense of truth and fairness . i have enough real fault a it be to put up with kafrs make thing up . secondly ; yes . if perhaps i think about the small town i grow up in missouri to the wealth of doha ; then there be certainly a lot more materialism and greed here . but if i be to compare doha to an equally wealthy place in the u.s. then it would be hard to believe that there be that much more greed here . what there be more of here ; but less than in most of the arab world ; i think ; be monopolization ; the sort of nepotism which kill efficiency ; an unfortunate emphasis on irrelevant form of status ( e.g . family and tribal membership ) over quality work and capability ; and extremem disparity . none of these be healthy in islamic standard . remember the prophet warn not to be destroy by what destroy those who come before - which be that they be strict in punish the poor but leniant in let the rich get away with thing . he warn but the arabs after some time do not listen . so ; it do certainly harm them ; and be destroy them ; at least socially . still ; they be my brother and i be with them in the same boat ... whether they all acknowledge that or not .

 those who guard the law forget the human right declaration three `` everyone have the right to life ; liberty and security of person . ''
 nice question and it be irony when we r try to answer . but man do feel bore or something ? ? ? how it come to ur mind ?
 one & s ; yes i m go to jail ! ! !
 ataulah may i know what be your crime ?
 do prison bus have emergency exit ? do prison bus have emergency exit ?
 only because you be in prison do not make you guilty .

 what kind of qtel vas ?
 maybe it 's a holy message tell you that you be the one that will free the muslim nation from their demon opressors . i suggest you go to homesrus and yell at the top of your voice `` i am ready to be the savior ; realsomeone is here to answer your call oh mighty god ''

 i hear you real ; i hate those message . i dont care if i buy 1 i get 3 free suit from some shop i never heard of . you can complain if a person be send you message but not complain if q-tel do it because i would imagine they be make money off it . i cant wait for voda  `` diplomacy be the art of say 'nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - will rogers ''
 be qtel spamming u ? i have be receive advertise sm from qtel for a while without my subscription ; be this legal ? can it be consider spamming ?
 it 's hard to know if qtel be just sell the number to company ; or if company be sell number to one another ; since my different mobile number get different spam . in any case ; i just do n't think there be any protection from it . as with anything government relate in this part of the world ; qtel can do what they like to who they like ; and there 's nothing you can do .
 thought i activate it by accident . ; hope voda wouldnt have something like this . for the mean time ; just ignore it .  call me one .

 to safeguard water in it ... .we human would have deplete it water by drink otherwise ... .
 another thing learnt . question : why be there salt in the ocean ?
 there be so many why question include this one : )
 it be estimate that the ocean form about 500 million year ago . a lot of the salt enter the ocean during their formative year . as igneous rock cool below the ocean ; they release a lot of the salt into the ocean . more salt enter the ocean a rock and sediment on the ocean floor dissolve . still more salt enter the ocean through the erosion of the land . as mountain gradually break down and rain wash over the land ; naturally occur salt of the earth be wash into the ocean . as water from the ocean evaporate ; the salt be leave behind ; so the ocean get more salty with time . http : //www.strangequestions.com/question/709/why-is-there-salt-in-the-ocean.html
 because all the sealife creature do susu in it that 's why it be salty ...
 because that way fish taste good .

 tambin habla un poco de espaol ; puedo leer y escribir correctamente ; pero es difcil de entender < i > '' news '' < /i > en la televisin en espaol . sorry ; i do n't remember what news be in spanish .
 as far a bonapart school be concern it be the official french school in qatar . they take french citizen on a priority list ; then french speak passport holder ( there be some agreement between french speak contries ) then other on a wait list . voltaire follow the french cursus ; be also sponsor by the french gov . but i be not sure if they hire exclusively french accreditated teacher .
 at voltaire school ; there be only french `` accreditated '' teacher . no local contract only to teach foreign language and for assistant for kidgarden ... for student ; there be 1/3 for qatari 1/3 for french and 1/3 for others . voltaire be also an official french school . 350 student against more than 1000 at bonaparte
 just take the car to the salwa road there be many company which be do computer checking of the car so like that you can ensure that the car be perfect or there be some faults.. ok thanks ! ! !

 any evening nursery ? does anybody know any evening nursery ? i have a baby 4 moth old and very much in need of childcare just for one evening ; 10th november ; next monday . dont want to use nanny since i dont know any of them and it be scary to leave baby with a stranger . please help !
 there be no such 'evenin nursery ' in doha that i know off . most nursery close in the afternoon ; i think the late be busy bees at 3pm ( i might be wrong ; you can check it out to clarify ) .
 dont u have any close friend that you could entrust your baby ? bcos i havent heard of any `` evening nursery '' b4 . even in our country . since most parent come home at night and thats the only time they could spend the time with their child . or at least go to some regular `` daycare center '' maybe some of them can make special arrangement for you . try it . livin the life
 if you contact starfish lane nursery ; alot of their teacher assistant available for baby sit service after school hour .
 what 's the difference between leave the baby with a nanny who be a stranger or a nursery with a bunch of stranger ? find a friend with a live-in maid that might `` lend '' you the maid for the evening . at least then you would get a trusted reference .
 absolutely .
 thank you for information .

 `` give the worker his due ; his right ; before his sweat dry '' by the prophet muhammed ( pbuh ) should be paste in all the management office at hmc . any sector in hmc which would be leave behind would somehow impact on the overall performance . i hope this will be iron out soon for the benefit of all concern . = )  `` no one be in charge of your happiness except you ''
 i absolutely refuse to believe that this be do because of economical crisis . it be all because of the inexperienced and inefficient administration of hmc . everyday there be some news of buy ultra expensive technology and equipment for hmc ; however ; they do n't have money to pay their staff . also ; they be constantly pressurise staff to perform good than their best . well ; all of u know the old saying . pay peanut and get monkey to work . hmc will soon turn into a monkey show . and no ; nothing be go to change in march 2010 . if there be a real problem ; it could be solve . there be no end to fake problem . are you nut ? ... ... no doubt i be crazy about you !
 is it true that all promotion for expatriate be stop for next 2 year a part of cost-cutting by the hospital ? a friend of mine say that ; thats the reason why they be give 1 month bonus to deviate the people 's attention from the bad thats yet to come !
 hmc promotions and recruitment does anyone know when do the promotion and recruitment start in hmc ? is it true that there be no money to give the employee promotion ? is it true that many staff think hmc be become a less desirable place to work ?
 never heard of that issue medboy but hopefully not.as far a i know they keep on recruiting nurse and i dont know with other sector in the hospital.lets wait for 2010 coz they still work this out and inshallah we will get the increment.its hard to hope and expect that far.lets just cross our finger ...
 try the plastic surgery centre !

 a big no ... u just waste money on shipping ... and u get very good one in india .
 noooooooo . only few item i find in qatar which have good quality and cheap price compare to india be : - 1 . saffron 2 . gold ( price be almost same but quality be good )
 dude ; it be not good idea to buy house hold item from here ; since all the branded stuff easily available in india with good price & warranty .
 i do that mistake six year ago . dealing with clear agent at custom ; and labourer union at custom yard be a nightmare i will never forget.they suck your blood to the last drop .
 not at all recommend - you get every household at your doorstep . you could carry some of the best chocolate etc . instead ... which will be cheap than duty free shop there .
 electronic item be subject to guarantee or warranty . what will you do if something go wrong with the lcd tv ; slit ac ; washing machine and cooking range ? if your be buy them from india most of them be with 2-5 year warranty and some be with 1-2 year guarantee . some brand be offer extend warranty by pay some extra money . if something go wrong you can call the shop where you buy it and they will arrange with the service centre for the necessary action . i know that some product have international warranty but it be not as easy a you be buy something locally in india . further more you will have to spend a lot of money for cargo even if it be by sea .
 is it worth buy household items in qatar and take it to india i be construct a house in india . wondering whether i can buy house hold item like lcd ; split acs ; cook range ; furniture etc from qatar and take it to india . if yes what be the suggested item to purchase here . also any reliable sea cargo -door to door service available thanks in advance

 yes ; sometimes the immigration officer ask for the sponsor oec ; depend on his/her mood so well send it to the phils .
 the immigration system can identify what particular visa the husband be use and history of your travel ; oec stand for overseas employment certificate meaning for worker under work visa but not for family/visit/business visa .
 they would need a copy of your oec together with marriage certificate for your wife and birth certificate for your child to avail the reduced travel tax otherwise they have to pay the full rate
 afaik ; oec be for ofw only ... but a denzon say ; if you want to avail the discount on travel tax/terminal fee ; they need to provide a copy of your oec ... hth ...

 hey buddy have to do this myself a month back and here 's what i learn : 1 ) first up ; you can normally only sponsor your immediate family or blood relative on a visit to qatar . what that mean be you cant sponsor your friend since he be not relate to you . i have hear of some people with special work visa who be able to do so but im guessing you be n't one of them 2 ) now the only option you have be to get a visa through a hotel for your friend..within this option you have two more option ; you can get a one month tourist visa for a thousand rial but he will have to stay in the hotel which will be expensive..your second and more feasible option be a business visa through the hotel..this will however cost you 2000 rial ; be valid for three month but the friend can stay with you instead of the hotel..there 's a few hotel that do this and you could try gulf horizon behind standard charter bank near the souq waqif/souq asiri area near the corniche . 3 ) now depend on the budget ; if your friend be visit for long ; then the business visa will be expensive but save the expense and hassle of stay in the hotel . but if it 's a short visit then you could inquire about the hotel 's rate for his stay.. so yeah ; i manage to get my buddy into doha because he be ready to pay 2000 for a business visa..hope you and your buddy can get together and have a great time too..best of luck buddy : - )

 be you a sri lankan ? ? ? i have visa for sri lankan.. try to get a filipino visa then let exchange.. give me a call 33237997..
 hi . i be south african ... ... how will this exchange work ? the person i want to employ will still need the noc ; ? ? i want to avoid pay such a vast sum of money ... . please explain !
 there be lot of maid look for a job do n't stick to the one you know ! most sponsor be opportunist ! if they see an opportunity they will demand ; although they want to get rid of their maid they want to make money in the last minute ! i release my maid at no cost ! especially those who be troublesome ! worse come to worst you will pay for that amount and the maid be a troublesome ! so how can you get your expense back ? if they be good worker the employer will keep them and will not try to make money in order to release them ! they only demand because they think they have waste a lot of money employ her !
 she have be employ with her current sponsor for 4 year and the previous sponsor for 5 year all here in doha and be in kuwait before that . i definitely do not think that her current sponsor waste their money ... she spend an hour with u and play with my son . we be very happy with the way she speak and conduct herself . if she do not get her noc then will she have to leave the country ? ? is there any way in which i can avoid pay the 6000 qar ? thanks
 why would n't you contact the sponsor and talk to him/her ? are you sure that the sponsor demans the money ?
 i call and speak to the sponsor . they pay 7000qar for her 4 year ago . they want that money back !
 i put my advert on every grocery store also here in qatar living and check advert everywhere such a newspaper ; grocery advertisement board and also here in ql ! i never approach any agency a my friend use to get their maid from agency and end up with lot of expense but if there 's anything go wrong with the maid they be obligued to replace them but it will be additional expense for you . the easy way for you to do be apply for a maid visa depend on the nationality you prepare and when visa be approve ; then you can start searcing for the right candidate locally who be look for an employer who can give them visa . otherwise ; there be also free-lancers ; who do not need sponsorship but of course you have to give them weekend day off a they be not under your sponsorship ; you be less in control of the situation . i have phobia sponsor maid a they tend to jump off the ship and get into trouble with cid . so in the end i just hire free-lancers ! it may not be cheap but less headache ! ; )
 conditions for get a noc hello all . i be currently interview for a nanny . we find someone who we would like to employ ; but she say that her current employer will only give her a noc ( no objection certificate ) if she or i pay them 6000 riyals ? ? ? she have work for them for 4 year . can i still employ her without the noc ? . i do n't think it fair that they be ask for 6000 qar ... ... any help/advise will be greatly appreciate . thanks
 7000 should be amortize over 4 years.. : ) to be honest ; do n't know what to suggest.. i wouldnt go the way jjh be suggest ... . put the ad in the grocery store to get a nanny for your kid be n't the best way to hire a good companion for them.. 6000 be a high price.. on the other hand if you go through the agency ; it wo n't be much cheaper.. you just have to come to conclusion that have a nanny be n't cheap.. and pay the fee ...
 jjh ; there be no such thing in qatar like free-lancer . you be violate the law and encourage other people ( your `` free-lancers '' ) to violate the law ... that 's what must bring you a headache ; not sponsor them..
 your experience be illegal . you can not employ someone who be not under your sponsorship without a legal permission from the authority .
 if you be an employee all you have to do to inform your department or your h.r . to arrange for you all the document require it an official procedure .
 well the law require that u get it cancel but they wont find out . i have a valid uae visa when i get married and move to my country but i make sure i visit within six month of my departure . this go on until i actually deliver my first child there ( dubai ) ; still on my father visa and get it cancel at the airport on my way out ( with my baby ) ! ! ! !

 anyone have practical experience of this situation ? ?
 you can buy the salik sticker even after the fine ; withen 2 day a i recall and can avoid the fine ; they will deduct the normal toll charge only .
 what be this salik sticker ? please explain ?
 in dubai
 how much be that ? seem bit complicated . fine / toll free / road tax : ( be confuse
 getting fine in dubai travel from doha can anyone tell me that if someone travel from doha to dubai on qatar register car and get radar or any other fine like salik in dubai . will he have to pay the fine ? and how to adjust that fine . with dubai govt ? or after come back here in qatar ? thanks
 no idea do n't let fantasy rob you of your real life beauty
 what if you get catch in dubai radar with a qatari car ? a man chase a woman until she catch him . ~american proverb .
 it 4 reyals toll for shaikh zayed road and if you get cought speeding there ; they send the fine to doha and u have to pay .. it money : )
 i have a fine show up from dubai on my registration number here from the previous owner . it take a long time to show up but that 's when the online system for check be quite new . it sound like you intend to speed . hope nobody get hurt ...
 once it be in the traffic police system and be share with the other govt . agency like immigration and border control ; if your car be outside of uae already you will either have to pay the next time you enter with the same car ; or if you be still there you will need to pay on exit .
 ya you need to pay the traffic fine accord to rta rule and can be pay through online . you can visit www.rta.ae then you can check the fine as well .
 sir ; he make it through hotel and when i go to book they refuse now when i call one friend of mine in the embassy he tell there be no law unless the passport be still valid she can travel .
 just go to ministry of labor in mutazah beside american hospital ; bring the new passport of your friend and the visa copy . first go to reception counter ask for a number and tell about your concern . wait for your turn ; if you meet the lady just ask her to change the passport number in the visa . on the following day you will see the result in the net . i do that also to my daughter just 2 month ago .
 kinder garden ; i dont know whether the legal formality for a non profit organization and profit organization be the same.but usually ; if you have to start a company ; you need a minimum capital of qar 200 ; 000/- which can be withdraw after the commencement of business.before the company get register ; you need to hire a villa/office or what ever.find a good sponsor as well . good luck !
 no idea but i think u need to have a good place a qatari sponser and all the requirements and a big large sum

 lol tb !
 for 7000k you ca n't survive here . think before make further move . good luck !
 i get an job offer for 7000 qr without accomodation and other transport facility ; can i take the offer my kid study state board education in 6 th and 3 rd standard ; maharastra india my wife be ma eng lit bed ; can i shift them and what be the fee and possibility for my wife get an teacher job at doha and my kid join school . me presently work in a logistics company earn 30 ; 000 inr .
 this offer kind of ok if they provide u family accomodation .
 you will spend minimum 3500qr for your accomodation ( partition villa 1bhk ... managable space ! ! ! ) ; for 4 people you will have a grocery bill around 1500qr per month . then your childrens study etc etc ... if your company will give you family accomodation ; transport it ok.. you can think about it ! !
 that 's hard ; for have 2 kid ; u need accomodation not less than 3500 qr/month other than the cost of living ; may be that can be accpetable if ur wife find a job this be applicable but not guarnteed
 now v r here in qatar in the same condition with 2 kid and same salary ; ; but no saving ; ; so please c for any other good chance ; ; besst of luck ; ; ;
 share accomodation : 3000 - 3500 qr grocery : 1000 - 1500 qr school fee : 1250 - 1750 qr conveyance : 1250 - 1500 qr from the above figure you can decide whether it be worth take the offer .
 no way ... the offer be not good for support a family ... one fully furnished 1bhk flat will go not below qar 5000/- ... this offer could be still considerable if the company provide you with a family accomodation +qr 7000 . thats the most expensive thing here ... negotiate with the company or else wait for good opportunity ...

 legally speak you be not allow to live together without be marry and if catch can be deport . and you can not get marry without a resident visa in doha . so well get married outside first ; get a visa and come to doha . once married you can live together . no problem .
 emily - i just check with my colleague here and here be what he have to say . he say you can not marry in qatar without a letter from your father give you permission to marry and it should be attest in the us . also you need to have 3 of your own witness .
 it 's cheap to marry in las vegas !
 you both need a residency permit to be marry in qatar . you will not get one since you be not employ and can not be sponsor by a fianc . you will have to be marry elsewhere - if indeed ; that be wise .
 hi emily ; are you in yemen now ? is it because of the hassle of get marry to a foreigner ? i be british and marry a yemeni woman . it be a real headache to get the paperwork do and take a lot of time . i consider leave yemen and get married abroad ; too ; but it really be not possible . an american i know in yemen take his wife ( to be ) to egypt to get married ; but once he get back to yemen ; i hear that the authority do not deem the marriage legal and he have to go through the whole process . ( this be what i hear ; but i can not be 100 % sure . ) i be not sure of your situation ; but can totally sympathise with you ; a the whole process take me two year to complete . i have my uk paperwork do in 3 month ; it be the yemeni side which take forever ! i do n't think it be possible for you to get married outside of yemen unless you take your fiancee to the states ; where you should be able to get it do . but then again ; visa to the us for yemenis be not so easy to come by . wish you luck . aq
 you can try the american embassy in qatar and do the registration certificate which should be ok and official ; check the us embassy in doha .
 pm me your email address i have application form with me
 ( iam also an indian ) dear sir/ madam first of all i would like to say you that you be a chutiya/ person because : 1 . ) you be here in the middle east for carrier-happiness or to entertain 3rdclass politicss . 2 . ) have you ever hear this kind of meaningless topic or question by an european/us or any other asian country guy . 3 . ) stop bothering your self ; focus upon your family . 4 . ) i hope you be a ( indian ) malbaari & because of you people & your cheap behaviours other indian 's be considered a 3rd class citizen ; here in the middle east .

 where i hve to apply for vote next indian election how can i use new rule that ; nr indians can vote for next indian parlament/assembly election ? where i have to apply for this ?
 dear trad.cont . ; you ca n't be so rude in your response . after all he be also an indian ; it hurt me be a malabari a you say . you need to learn a lot from them to become an indian first .
 dear trad . cont . i feel sorry and shame on you ; a an indian do you know what be democracy and value of right to vote ... .. democracy have become even more important in the present scenario.democracy be say to be the rule of majority and majority should have the authority otherwise there would be serious consequence . when the basic right of people be deny then they become livid and do n't give respect to the right of others . that 's why violence be on rise . in democracy people decide who will govern and who will rule . if the democracy be establish in it true form and the institution be strengthen so that every one be accountable for what he have do ; the world will be a good place for living . in democracy access to justice be equal for every one and no one can snub the right of others . rule of law be insure and hence people respect each other 's rights.in today 's world terrorism and extremism be on rise . suicide attack have threaten everyone and the basic reason be injustice . when innocent people be deny of their right they do not remain innocent any more . when people be not give respect then they do n't care for the respect of others . this be the point where democracy become important a it protect the right of the people ; and in order to establish democracy you should have vote right . come on wake up trad.cont . you be in 2011 ; do n't be a fool of your self ... ... .

 nature have create form ; shape ; and trait that attract opposite gender . unfortunately society have surpressed these natural feeling all the way through custom ; tradition ; and religion . hence ; many people grow up run into problem . the playboy beauty be only 'beautiful ' for a limited class of people .
 beauty lie in the hand of the beer holder
 a beautiful heart make a person beautiful however ugly they may seem physically . a black and ugly heart will make even the most beautiful person look ugly ... ..
 defines it all
 being elegant be beauty.god 's precious gift to one..
 no pimple : )
 what defines beauty ? what be the physical trait which contribute to on be beautiful ? what be the key parameter ? i wonder how some people look so beautiful/handsome and some do n't !
 `` women be not ugly : the drink be not enough ! '' ( romanian saying.. )
 beauty be in the eye of `` looker '' not in the `` look '' . but we may agree that at a certain level there 's a basis on which all human agree . it 's all about proportion . if you take the composition of a human face . each element alone be ugly . and a place together they may be good look or ugly . and because we always look to human face our brain can rapidly differentiate very small detail and amplify these in the scale of beauty . look at black people of african tribe ( no offense ) they may be regard by a blonde a all ugly . but in fact they develop a differentiating criterion and new scale of beauty . let 's look at you cat . cat see human face the same . because we also see cat all the same . but if you have 20 cat at home you can see some differentiator . it 's all about the eye of the `` looker ''
 when you look someone male or female you should feel the kindness and peace . a man be modest when he admire his wife always and keep himself away from other woman and a wife be modest when she show her beauty only to her husband and men and woman both be modest when they find the happiness through make her husband or his wife happy . making a life a the wish of god make them modest . as a muslim i be so proud to say that i see my wife a the most beautiful girl in the world . that make me to stay away from all other woman . please do read these article 1. http : //www.islamweb.net/womane/nindex.php ? page=readart & id=149442 2. http : //www.islamweb.net/womane/nindex.php ? page=readart & id=158760
 well say : o ) `` i wonder how some people look so beautiful/handsome and some do n't ! '' because ; beauty be subjective.. i could tell you about my cuban shotputter ; but there be not enough page on the screen : o (
 beauty be in the eye of the beholder.. its not about physical but it about the heart and the attitude ; the way deal with other people show kindness ; that be the beauty ...
 i do n't agree with all these sorry poknat . ugly woman say the beauty be internal ! bullshit there be beautiful and ugly ! ( i 'm mathematician ) ugly woman should accept it that 's all and avoid over makeup because that will make here look ugly .
 how do you define ugliness or beauty ?
 - symetry be a sine qua non quality to be beautifull/harmonious . - color ( white teeth ; red lip ; eye ; one-color hair ... ) - cleanliness ( hair well do ; skin ; teeth ... ) - smell - sound ( voice ) - size/ratios ( chest-waist-hips ) - form ( long neck ; face shape ; hair ; dress.. )
 the standard of beauty be not definite ; you define it . it be how you carry yourself in the face of all the people ; situation surround you . for you ; how do you define beauty ? everyone here have a word to say about beauty and if that be there personal view about the topic than so be it ... .^^
 beauty be a very big word that most people do not understand and easily mis-interprete most time . have you ever wonder why some find tall lady pretty and others think petite lady make the world go round ? and why do some like light skin tone and others will go anywhere around the world just to have a darker skin tone ? ? or why do some people simply just get bore of the beauty queen the marry recently ? it because ; beauty is a combination of desirable physical ; moral and intellectual qualities . physical beauty be a combination of quality like shape of body ; color ( light or dark tone of skin ; hair ; eye not necesarily ethnic background ) and form so that it cause a pleasing effect on the beholder sens . the right mix of this differs from person to person . its good know a pretty in female and handsome in male or good look in general . moral beauty be influence by culture and tradition ( also religion ) of the locality . and moral beauty quality include modesty ; comportment ; respect ; charisma ; cleanliness and others . intellectual beauty be wisdom or practical use of knowledge . we can see that ; though it be not wrong ; most people judge beauty base on the physical only ; but this be just a part of beauty call `` look '' and be only skin- deep ; not the total beauty . a true and total beauty be a person that have a reasonable amount of the physical ; moral and intellectual beauty . this be the standard use for most beauty pageant ; but offcourse ; the moral and intellectual part be usually play low . your grandma can be a moral and intellectual beauty but not a looker ! ... atleast not anymore . ; ) . what might be beautiful to one be not to the other since everyone have a different standard of measure ; but can agree on a general level . on a final note ; since physical beauty can tarnish with time ; timelesss beauty can be say to be the inner moral and intellectual beauty of any person . everyone can be beautiful ; ... without surgery . think about it .

 tnx dude ; ; i have money but it 's not me to spend 2000qr just to have fun ;
 it will get interactive only if they allow the opportunity .
 they prolly know that very few people listen to them anyway so ...
 just like the local newspaper you would probably get very little information worth listen to on this station . perhaps try tune to the french service of qbs
 it there in the arabic service .
 why would they report traffic news ? it 's the same reason why weather reporting be not big business . the report would be -- heavy congestion at every round about ; multiple accent ; crazy driver in little pick-ups ; aggressive driver in lcs and large truck generally be moronic . in other word ; it 's lethal out there so drive something large and pray a lot .
 traffic news on the radio ? why be n't traffic report broadcast regularly on the local qbs radio during the rush hour ? not suggest report all the jam ; otherwise no time for music ; but even if we know about the late serious accident ; like on the expressway tonight ; it may give driver a chance to take an alternative route ... .assuming that they 're not already jam up .
 the truth be simple but seldom ever see . qbs be n't a 'news channel ' ! it 's an amateur radio station and serve a an alibi . do n't expect anything and you 'll be fine .
 are you a fan of star strek ?
 i be no `` fan '' of anything ; tcom ! `` fan '' come from `` fanatic '' ; you know ?
 i be talk about your id
 my favourite english radio station in qatar : 1 . studio one fm ( ksa ) 2 . radio 2 ( uae ) 3 . radio bahrain ditto !
 my favourite english radio station in qatar : 1 . studio one fm ( ksa ) 91.4 or 94.1 ( ca n't remember which ? ) 2 . radio 2 ( uae ) 106.0 3 . radio bahrain 96.5 these be for the english language station which you can receive here all a bit 'weather-dependent'- unfortunately - but somewhat miraculous that they work at all . also if all else fail try 101.7 for the sound feed from al jazeera english tv news channel . makes any prog with sub-titles a bit tricky though . : - )
 listening to qbs make a dead person alive from the grave and again dead ... : )
 there be a day when they be play some ass-boring music and then this british guy ; with a strange voice ( bernie ) say he get tire of get sms criticize his musical choice ; and that he do not care and therefore he would continue play the same ole-same ole . that be the day when i stop listen to this grap !
 on 104.8 mhz be also sometimes receivable . but all the long distance fm channel seem to have go in the last few day with the arrival of autumn ? must be a heat/humidity thing that allow u to receive them in summer .
 that 's what be say on that radio station when one of the announcer ( forget his name ) negate that him and bernie sound alike .
 traffic news on the radio ? why be n't traffic report broadcast regularly on the local qbs radio during the rush hour ? not suggest report all the jam ; otherwise no time for music ; but even if we know about the late serious accident ; like on the expressway tonight ; it may give driver a chance to take an alternative route ... .assuming that they 're not already jam up .
 if dubai and bahrain fm radio station be receive clearly in qatar then who would listen to 97.5 ?

 go for kia cerato
 out of these ; i will choose nissan tiida
 cruize if you wont use the car for many years.. if you will go for tida..
 either toyota or nissan . go for toyota corolla or tida ... dont go for other brand ; initial cost be less but the maintenance be very expensive
 chevy cruze . without doubt ; it be make in korea and maintenance be cheap
 car advice ? which one be well ? 1- nissan tiida 1.8 sedan ( 2011 ) 2- chevrolet cruze 1.8 ( 2011 ) 3- kia cerato 1.6 ( 2012 ) have no idea about car but have to choose one of them to drive ? which one shall i choose ? thanks
 tida
 i would go for the nissan
 to tell you what i observed.. if you would ask filipino 's most would go for cruise coz of the looks.. if you observe far most filipino 's drive mazda 3 ; honda civic and lancer ex gt becoz of it sporty looks.. but not consider the look tida would be the best of the two youve mentioned.. try to consider mazda.. not a top brand but it can compete with look ; price and performance..
 ok thanks guy and tigabaguio : ) i will think about tiida then : )
 o general be best compny 1.5 ton ac be good . qr around 1400/-

 hello.. if you have qnb account ; you can apply for master e card.qnb offer it customer a secure way to shop online . the mastercard e-card have be specifically design to allow only internet transaction . it can not be use at atms and pos terminal at shop . qnb mastercard e-card be issue a supplementary card to the main credit card with a low credit limit . enjoy your online shopping once you get this..
 in cbq they be offer virtual card .
 some bank also offer a pre-paid internet shop card . functions more like a debit card than a credit card ; becuase you purchase the card in a set amount and then spend it via internet purchase ; rather than have a credit limit . i know for sure that doha bank do this last year ; and i have hear that other bank do as well . at doha bank you need to be an account holder . hope this help .
 go for doha bank inernet card i m use it.its good and secure
 credit cards should not be use online to make purchase . prepaid internet card in qatar be issue to only those people who already have a credit card even if you have an account with the bank . why it should be link to `` credit '' when the payment be `` prepaid '' ? beats me .

 supply lunch at work & dinner at home open chain of club with gym ; swim pool ; squash etc drop the child to school arrange tuition class on all subject run hobby class like painting ; music etc take care of plant & pet when expat be on vacation drop people to airport & receive them on arrival door to door delivery of goody to their home country suggest investment plan & tip on share market home delivery of fresh ; clean & cut vegetable arrange concert & live music show arrange dj 's & dance party ceremonial hall of 5000 plus capacity arrange tour & travels maintenance of building inform your capability & investment capacity & you can get lot more idea

 bleu : you 're right that 's why a detailed business plan be a must
 this site might give u good help ; www.islamweb.net
 i do n't want to be harsh but parent be equally responsible for inculcate proper educational value in a child . parent should be more involved with the education of the child even if they be busy . qatar be a place where you can not rely completely on the teaching staff and tutor the child be quite expensive . unless the child be exceptionally talented he/she need parental guidance .
 sorry to hear about the result of your child ; ... which exams you 're talk about ? federal board exams be proceed these day ... but you 're mention the result . are your child study in the other stream the cambridge system ?
 how do we improve std of education ? ... my child do n't get good result this time from board exam . in bfps result be pathetic . because ; lady principal send good qualify teacher to pakistan . she be do trial and error experiment with our child 's future . how do we improve std of our childrens education ?
 what do you mean by `` do n't get good result '' ? can you tell u how bad be the performance ?
 i think your intention be to criticize the lady principal . 9th and 10th stander exam still not over and 11th -12th exam will start on 4th next month ; what you mean by board exam . in bfps result be pathetic . which board announces result when exam be yet to start ?
 i agree with mom here ... no school be either good or bad and yes there may be good and bad teacher give that in this part of the world it very diff to get qualified and experienced teacher a they be pay peanut . but that be say we a parent be also in many way responsible for the education of our child . just study the lesson in school arent enough . when they come home see that they revise their work everyday and do their home work on their own . guide them properly and give them good book to read to expand their knowledge . a teacher only guides the child . and if the teacher have not explaind the chapter well or you feel the child need more then try to do the same at home or hire a tutor to help your child . that be say - every child have their limitation . we shudnt expect our child to perfom miracle nor bring in 100 % result all the time . just encourage your child to do good than the last time every time he sit for an exam and try not to create any panic or tension . every exam shud be approach with a cool head and dont encourage your child to memorize . teach them to understand the subject and study . that not only create an interest but retention power be more .
 sorry ; i think the 'std ' in the op mean something else .
 < p > hi rising stars kindergarten be excellent ! i think you have beeen misinform by your friend regard the child watch tv all day . children who arrive early before class commence be supervise in the tv room . at the end of the day child go to the tv room if they have not be pick up on time ! parents appreciate this service a there be no extra charge.you say you go to check in the holiday and every class have a tv in it . i do n't know which kindergarten you visit but it certainly be not rising stars . the only tv be in the tv room . during the holiday a summer camp be in progress ! i invite you to visit rising stars anytime then please post a valid and truthful comment. < /p >
 really surprised to hear this comment ; my son go to rsk and he have really excel since we enrol him there . they have only one tv room like any other kindergarten ; so i do not understand where `` tv 's '' come from ? i think you have be misinform ! !
 hello ; my daughter go to this kindergarten and it be appal ; they have one tv room . however ; it seem the teacher leave the child there . i do not like this kindergarten at all ; there be no british teacher . i try to communicate with the manager who smelt like she have be smoke ; her mannerism be very unprofessional . upon communication with the teacher ; it seem none of them have any experience or a bachelor degree . this nursery be a disgrace to the british system ; such a shame .
 my kid go to this kindergarten and she be happy there . sorry but it seem that your comment be too personal . you obviously have some personal bad intention by make this comment and anyone can see that .
 i do n't really get where kiwi be get her info from . i think it 's a 'disgrace ' and 'shameful ' that she be try to incite hate when she be so clearly misinform . i also do n't know why she be comment on a post from a year ago . i smell sour grape . anyways i 'm only comment because i read her/his reply and i be appal by why he/she be try to slander such a lovely kindergarten . my son go to rising stars and it have by far exceed my expectation . everyone be friendly and polite ; and the manager have always be professional in my presence . the child be definitely not leave in the tv room all day ; i have be at different time of the morning to pick up my son ( we travel a lot ) and he have always be in the classroom with his teacher . also to my knowledge they do follow the british curriculum for a kindergarten ; and my son have flourish since attend . he cry when he be sick and ca n't go to school . as for your comment about 'british teacher ' ; again as far a i know ; they be n't all british but they be all english native speaker ( apart from the arabic teacher and assistant ) . i do n't really want to sound like an ad for rising stars or waste my time on a post that be make a year ago ; so i would urge people to see for themselves what it be like ; a my husband and i be extremely pleased with it .

 there be a lot of place that fit this description ; with the exception of reasonable ; of course . rents in doha be about 4 time what they be in the us and that be mostly because employer pay the bill . is your husband 's company not cover housing ? how about school tuition ? these be consider standard perk in doha . i would suggest come to see first . you really do n't want to rent sight unseen here . there be too many nasty surprise .
 barwa appartments be real great -
 either u hav to complete 2 year before u enter qatar or you need to get the noc from ur previous employer ...

 visiting qatar on visit visa or business visa after rp cancellation does any 1 have idea that one can visit qatar on visit or business visa after rp cancellation ? do that 2 year limit applies on entry to qatar on all visas ?
 i doubt if above answer r give by professional ?
 uarif ; i be in this situation recently and i can assure you ; from personal experience ; that without noc you can not enter the country on a visit or business visa . if your family be still in doha ( father ; mother ; brother etc ) you can enter on a family visit visa which be valid for one month extendable upto six month . that be the only option that you have . of course ; if you be hold another gcc rp ; then you can enter with an on-arrival visa ( provide your profession fall in the eligible category ) . make sure that the first time you fly to doha in this instance ; you fly via the national carrier i.e . qatar airways . hope this be helpful .
 @ visibly hide ; do you know anybody ; travel to qatar with on arrival visa during ban period ; who be a gcc resident

 i think the singer store that be on a roundabout near the souk ; they usually have thread and bind material .
 its because the dollar be tumble and festival and marriage season in india
 it be the international trend ; recently india buy a significant quantity of gold and it seem to go on buying ; from fmi ; so the price grow up . check the international market trend ; now be around 1100 us $ /ounce ; after the fmi sell cca 1/2 from it 's reserve of cca 400 ton gold . will increase in my opinion ; too ; because in crisis everybody invest in gold .
 low dollar price push up the gold price a a hedge against possible future inflation .
 why gold price increase ? gold price be steadily increase . does it show the poor foundation of the fiat currency ?
 due to high demand of gold in india & other country because of festival and safe money to invest .
 because imf just sell a record quantity of gold to the central bank of india and look like china will follow suit . also because people be nervous about hold on to the us dollar due to the us inflation rate and the perceived slowness of recovery compare to the other economy . bad news for those receive their income in us dollar or other currency fixed-pegged to the greenback ( such a qatari riyals )
 i hope so..
 thank you for comment : ) i will check all of them . there be no big choice : ( i hope they have a place .
 one of the international schools ; like london international school ? they have specific progrmmes for child with english a a second language .
 most of this school require entry test - english and math . my son will not pass it ; especially not language test . in montesorri tell me that only cedars specialize in english a a second language . i send an e-mail to them one week ago and they do n't reply : ( i think i must go there . it seem to be a problem to put my son to a school ... ewa
 i look at cedars for my child it seem very good ; you should give them a call .

 i be good betty.. how be you.. i think it 's ok to hijack this thread now .
 some of your point be valid . i think we all know nepotism be rife . we all know that 'some ' people over here apply for job they be not qualify for and indeed get them a somebody in hr know them and they be from the same area . it have be point out many time by many people ; include me . however ; i would now not post anymore if i be you . you will get stalked and insulted ! there be no point in point out the obvious . i have learn this the hard way .
 roy2jacinto ... i suppose this guy at your office have take a liking for you and you for him and though you say you want to get away you seem to be stick in there by choice . have fun and enjoy the once in a lifetime experience and till the salary keep come dont complain much
 la la la ; no complains mate . i love this job ; i have so many extra time for extra activity . lol ! i do n't care about them .
 for sure you do n't know what be a nice smell if you 're from india ~ you guy have this strong bond to each another ; this common smell you guy have be just one example .
 your peculiar smell and his heavenly perfume must be create an out of this world concotion . look on the bright side ; if you two colloberate and get into the perfume and cosmetic business you both would have an outstanding product to keep away crawl and fly insect
 fu they be all connect . it 's easy to see that the company do n't contact the op for any job because of his smell . he only apply online should be ignore for the sake of the healthy discussion we be have here .
 wk - companies do n't contact him because he have a moustache on his cheap x-ray maybe .

 vodafone be the best ...
 q-tel rock love it ; have be use their service for the past 9 year ; they have realy improve over the year . q-tel coverage be all over qatar as well all over the world . my halla sim card work in paris ; uk ; us and india .
 i read on ql a few month before ; vodafone be agree to use qtel data center that manage by qtel . so big possibility vodafone backbone still use qtel network . so well to use qtel directly .
 mobile and internet hello everyone ; how be the new vodafone mobile and broadband internet service in qatar and how be the coverage in all area . this service appear easy on the pocket and more flexible and that 's why i be apprehensive about the service . or be qtel the best ? thanks . vivme
 many thanks for all the answer .
 u cant ues there becouse of rule be defrans

 you can drive rent a car in uae with qatar driving license..same rule in qatar but people misuse that be deferent story
 temporarily you can . i be there for 2 month on a visit visa and use my qatar driver license on a rental car . you can not however exchange your qatar license to a uae license without go through a driving test .
 no it not you can get by this price well car if you can take it by 15000-18000 it will be good
 faisal essa whre can i get hyundai coupe fx 2006 for 15000-18000..itz nt 2001 to get 4 15000 ... .itz 2006 ... rinku itz well price u can go for it
 rinku the price be good for that model but the only problem be that it have do 165000km ... . & thats too much ... .so price be reasonable for that hyundai coupe model but if you see the kms it have do then ofcourse the price be a lil high ... plus if it a v6 then you must know that the re-sell price value of v6 car be less then v4 .
 you be lucky to get around qr20k

 personal hygiene why do most people from s ... . asia have foul odor in their body especially underarms ? is it related to their food diet or just a neglect to personal hygiene ?
 we all stink just ask my dog !
 good question ... but i 've be with some african ... you ca n't stand with them ... atleast 100m required ! well no offense..they work really hard .
 i be on a return flight from dubai and approx . 30 ethiopians get on ( i saw it on their passport ) . some of them smell horrible . they appear to be well dress and appeared clean but smell like ... cattle be the close analog i can think of .
 regarding the term you use up there to describe the people of pakistan ... it be usually consider offensive when use by a non-asian ... http : //en.wiktionary.org/wiki/paki regarding the thread ... oft discuss ... search before you post ... plus that 's offensive to a lot of people ...
 dude how do you know it come exactly from underarm ? smell police again ! -- -if you ca n't convince them ; confuse them ! ! !
 it be not all ; but most . and it be relate to `` lifestye '' . they ca n't afford boss and channel ; and qatar ca n't afford to replace them with higer pay europeans or even arabs . it be not just the nuclear scientist who do what others generally can not do . it be also `` a public road sweeper do ; what others can not generally do '' . hope you get it .
 reysaj i can bash every country in the world over one issue or another here ; but you do n't always have to do what you can ... just my thoughts.. jackfrost i can get it from most of your post that you be a very intelligent man but somehow i think you love provoke others ; i always think you do it to tease the hardliner but still it be unfortunate to see a smart man act this way.. when you be court a nice girl an hour seem like a second . when you sit on a red-hot cinder a second seem like an hour . that 's relativity . - albert einstein
 all of the above ... just hold your breath and keep distance with them ... .
 how long can you hold your breath ; chinx ?
 hahaha not for long..if i cant stand it anymore i 'll run away from them .
 personal hygiene why do most people from s ... . asia have foul odor in their body especially underarms ? is it related to their food diet or just a neglect to personal hygiene ?
 .. and where to do you run in an airplane ; for example ? ? or do you just pass out when fly ?
 well i never get a chance to ride an airplane together with this pipz..only here in qatar i discover such horrible unique smell ...
 it a neglectgence of a person ; a person who doesnt teach by their parent and their teacher in school for proper hygiene ...
 i wish people would just stop point finger ( and nose ) at all these little thing ... life 's much more than that ... yes i do agree some of the practice of the people of asia be well downright disgust ... but generalization be far more disgusting ... plus no one be perfect ... the people who stink ( usually ) be those guy who work 10 to 12 hour a day in the sun and earn 600 to 800 riyal a month ... ca n't fault them for not use boss or lacoste ... give them a break people and thank god every time you come across a less fortunate person ... i be not try to justify them ... but i just feel that just because we have be give the best in life ( not by our virtue ) do not give u the right to put down some one who be from a low social stratum ... my personal peeve be spit ... when i see someone open a door and spit at a traffic light ... my first instinct be to go out and bang the door on his head ... but then i count from 1 to 10 and drive on ... then there be bad breath ... i be not even go to open my mouth regard this ... : ) i be sorry jackfrost ... i 've never be in your position ... and i hope i never have to ...
 to keep urself clean and tidy from odour germ ... take bath daily ... and keep the body surface clean ... by the way i do n't think so anyone here be sardar ... . ; d
 it 's not just the construction worker ... some who work in office smell too . who dress clean and nice . really ... sometimes the smell can make you pass out or make your stomach churn . so gross ... : (
 this be not a matter of perfume you be wear but a matter of hygiene awareness..even you pour a bottle of channel to your body and do n't bath daily still the same unlikely smell will overpower dude ...
 rezy i live with sardars for 25 year ( though i be not one ) and they be the clean people i ever meet when you be court a nice girl an hour seem like a second . when you sit on a red-hot cinder a second seem like an hour . that 's relativity . - albert einstein
 there be do 's and don'ts everwhere ... . i meet with one sardar and ask ... he reply that we do not remove our hear and if any tear from our body ... .we fold in a peace of paper and save it ... it like what our tradition ... .
 but he use to cut his hair and shave ... so i do not know ... and ya i 've read that the sikh never cut their hair ... have to do with tradition ... so with hair that long must be hard to take shower ... hmmm ... can you shed some light on this mr. sandeep ...
 personal hygiene why do most people from s ... . asia have foul odor in their body especially underarms ? is it related to their food diet or just a neglect to personal hygiene ?
 ... stuff make with lot of cottage cheese ; flour ; sugar ; spice and love ... yum ... man i miss those day ... p ... the sikh do not smell bad ... not the one 's i know ...
 why do you guy love to fee the troll < pre > [ img ] < /pre >
 no offense but i agree with jackfrost on his frist comment ... reality bite !
 only fool generalise ; and there be many around . no offense  - listen to many ... speak to a few -
 why do n't you just accept it ! most of the indian here in doha really stink ; even lady ; not only in public bus but even here at the office and mall . working under the sun for 12 hour be not a valid reason if you know how to take care of your arm pit .
 the stink from the hardworking labor in sun dust be good than stink comment of jackfrost whose brian be frost any way ; and those who have come to qatar from the smoky mountain of manila ; bias ; jealousy ; keep your stink comment to yourself.nakumura why go so close to armpit of people .
 well manila be have a good smell than you !  life be short ... 300 meter before roundabout !
 south asians with poor personal hygiene smell bad ; it have to do with a combination of poor personal hygiene & their diet ; i a a south asian myself ( not one with poor personal hygiene however ! ) fully understand & accept that ... what i do not understand however be the filipinos on here point finger ? ? ? ... i mean ; nothing can smell as bad a filipino food ; this be just my opinion & i 'm extremely tolerant when it come to food ; but that stuff ; whoa ! man ; feel like throw up every time i get a whiff of it & have to really restrain myself ; it 's a very unpleasant odour ; to put it a politically correct a i can ... i mean ; the fish be mostly raw with the scale still on & the eye star out @ you & the soups/sauces just smell really bad & i 'm sure many non-filipinos will agree with me ; but i 'm not go put up a post on ql screaming ; '' filipino food stinks ! '' be i ? ... i hope people get my point here ; all communities especially asian one will have issue about them that other community find difficult to deal with ; have a bit of a broad mind never hurt anyone ; so to all my `` fresh smelling '' filipino friends here ; deal with your south asian colleague bo in the same way they deal with your fo ( food odour ) ; fair enough ? ...

 personal hygiene why do most people from s ... . asia have foul odor in their body especially underarms ? is it related to their food diet or just a neglect to personal hygiene ?
 @ nakamura ; to each his/her own be exactly the point i be try to make but quite clearly ; you do n't get it ; so i will repeat myself ... to me ; filipino food smell bad ; just like to you ; your neighbour 's curry smell bad ; different stroke for different folk boy ... comprehende ? ... & btw ; that `` smelly curry '' you 're refer to be know & appreciate all over the world ; ca n't turn a corner in the uk without encounter a `` curry house '' ; so clearly ; not a lot of people around the world share your view of `` smelly curry '' or there would n't be so many indian restaurant around the world ; now would there my friend ? ... oh & have we meet ? ... because for you to make that scream capital multi-colour statement @ the end of your post ; you 'd have to have be in close proximity to me right ? ... 'cos i know a couple of japanese people ... you ai n't one of 'em ... you 've obviously take this personally ; i wonder why ? ... i 'm not a big sushi fan but i love teppenyaki & i do n't think neither do i say japanese food smell bad so ? ? ? ... so you 're japanese ... & the pope be irish ...
 i usually ride the bus every morning but i do n't take the bus with too many indian coz i ca n't really stand the smell of most of them ; just like this morning ; i tell one guy to put his arm down coz i really felt dizzy due to the smell of his arm pit
 arien ; why do n't you just accept it that most of you do n't use deodorant and hardly take a shower in a day or week .
 yeah h4t3 ; ride the bus and you judge ; try even in the morning be most people be suppose to be fresh ... .
 sometimes it 's good to be talk to a stupid person than a person who stink ... ... do i generalize ? i say most of you ; now do n't be offend and start take a shower daily use soap and deodorant and you 'll see ...
 u stink like a pig cuz u eat them ; )
 @ nakamura ... '' whatever '' be not the answer to my point ; you 're a fake ; you 're obviously filipino but lack the national pride to put it up a your nationality state `` japanese '' instead & give yourself a japanese name ; so please explain to me why you 're so offend by my claim & take it personally ? ... you do n't have enough nationalistic pride to even truthfully state your nationality yet you take offence when someone say your food smell bad ? ? ? ... first be honest to yourself & everyone else & take pride in who you be & your country then we 'll debate this ; until then ; you have nothing comprehende ? ...

 you know guy i 'd appreciate the time you give into discussion of my thread . but i see someone be hurt or someone be point another . as an author ; i would like to apologize for post this topic because i felt responsible for unpleasant response from other people . its like somebody be throw raze of fireball . please let u not do that . my main purpose of this be to gather view about proper hygiene to which helpful to the people involve who be unaware to have the foul-smelling odor in their body . i be very unfortunate that i do n't have a pc of my own so i ca n't check my thread every now and then . you know it happen that i have many co-worker come from those country ( opps ... i 'm not point a particular nationality ) that have a foul-smell . they be not just ordinary worker huh ; they be supervisor ... . that 's why i 'm so disgusted and i 'm try to avoid them and even hold my breath when encounter them . i hope the mowasalat company would also encourage their driver to be clean and defeinitely be free from the foul-smelling odor a they be serve the public because i 've observed that there driver have a stink odor too ... . guys ; you can try this simple tip to lessen the foul-smelling odor of your colleage in the workplace : 1 . please advise him/her to use a very cheap deodorant like tawas or potassium alum . do it in a secret and gentle manner . a variuos kind of deodorant be available in the market . 2 . try to offer him/her a present with a soap and deodorant inside . use your initiative to do it so that the person be not offend . above all ; let us make peace ; not war .
 personal hygiene why do most people from s ... . asia have foul odor in their body especially underarms ? is it related to their food diet or just a neglect to personal hygiene ?
 shower everyday and rubbing a lemon on underarm will do.even you work 10-12 hours a day still its not an excuse for bad odor . : )

 the more the couple advertise it the more chance that the police will raid the flat ...
 unless you go around shout `` we 're not married but living together '' the chance of anyone knowing be pretty remote .
 chances=one unmarried couple divide by the total number of unmarried couple in doha
 it depend on what position they be catch in
 the chance depend entirely on the accuracy and source of the information provide .
 and the news out be they normally check out the kabayan only ; kerala only accomodation on a priority basis a they may find something besides the normal go on out here at this place
 depends on how you go along with your neighbor and the people around you ; aside from your partner .
 chances be ... what be the chance that the police department will raid a certain flat because there be unmarried couple live together in the flat ?
 so it all depend on the info give to the raider huh ... then maybe it better to check any flat in surprise !

 is there anybody living in the pearl ? i saw many car park under udc tower . does anybody know if people start live in the pearl ? as an apartment owner in the pearl ; i feed up with the postponing of the handover date ...
 why not contact udc ; if they be your developer ; to get a clear picture ( good or bad ) ; rather than rely on others ; who may or may not be well-informed and could be give you accurate information or idle speculation ? i be also an investor in the pearl ; and have find ; in all my dealing with udc ( ie the people at the oyster ) ; that they be very professional ; helpful and transparent . they will tell you the situation a it stand now ; progress and delay ; because it be in their interest to ensure that investor have confidence in them and their project . my apartment be in viva bahriya ; so not due for completion yet . it be hard to wait ; because once you 've be down and see for yourself the scope of the project ; you just want to move in and enjoy sit on your balcony overlook the sea . ignore the sniper ; stay cool ; it will be worth the wait !
 i know it be hard to wait ; especially give the current economic uncertainty ; but none of u ( include the developer and the bank ) could have predict what have happen ; on a global scale ; over the last few month ; so we be all have to adjust to the new reality which we didnt foresee when we originally make the investment . as any investment be about confidence ; it do n't make sense to 'talk down ' the project ; or encourage rumour about how awful the project be . if you look at other thread on this subject ; you can see that those directly involve in the construction be all proud of it : only those unconnected but with 'inside knowledge ' ( ie from friend of friend ) be predict doom . again ; i suggest that you go down to the site and speak to the developer to get a clearer picture which will help you plan .
 no one live at the pearl yet . as there be no water or electricity service yet . udc and kharamma be lock in a power struggle over cost and the poor buyer of flat be the loser .
 having follow up with udc ; i have learn that the issue with the power supply be in fact resolve almost 2 week ago and they expect people to be live in porto arabia by the end of may . please do n't take my word for this ; ( after all i could just be another one spreading rumor ) ; check with them yourself to see how your property fit into the schedule . hope it go well for you !
 i talk to udc and they say their tower will be open in may . electricity and water problem be solve and ready for all porto arabia . i guess in the 4th quarter of this year ; most of the tower will be open . i be in abu dhabi at the weekend and stay in one of my friend apartment . his apartment be have a magnificent sea view next to beach ( like the apartment in the pearl ) . it give me some idea how the life will be in the pearl ; simply `` dolce vita ! ! ! '' . most of the people live in doha can not imagine the life style in the pearl and when it will be complete ; i be sure it will be one of the dream place to live in . so ; we wait a lot but i guess it will worth it !
 istavrit ; i be down there this week as well and totally amaze at the progress ; especially with the shop ( ok ; just need the money to buy ) ; cafe and landscaping . the waterfront be beautiful and the atmosphere unlike anywhere else in doha ; more reminiscent of palm beach or part of europe . the project be really move on and take shape .

 car loan suugestion what should be the minimum salary to apply for car loan ?
 ur sponsor will confirm by a letter to the bank that he ll deposit ur salary in the same bank for the loan period .
 4k be the requirement.. but you have to check first if your company be accredit by your bank.. other wise check for the bank where your company be accredit then transfer your account their..
 same question
 here be some thing that might help . firstly ; the bare minimum stuff . 1 ) salary of 7000 or high ( sometimes they approve for 6000 also ) . 2 ) six month bank statement with salary transfer . 3 ) you need to be an rp holder . 4 ) your designation on visa shld be respectable . something like engineer or doctor or manager or accountant etc . believe me point 4 be the most important . i have a friend who earn 15k per month ; but due to lack of visa his company have give him a field operator visa for temp purpose ; and now he be not able to sponser his wife . now that you get the basic straight ... you need a few document . 1 ) go to some arabic type guy near sofitel ( there be lot of them there ) . 2 ) they have a sample of no objection certificate . get it type in arabic with your detail . 3 ) get the offer letter ( they have sample ) also type from them . 4 ) get 3 copy of 2 & 3 and get them sign and seal from ur sponsor . 5 ) take those doc to the labour department and submit them . they will keep 1 copy and return you 2 more . keep 1 for yourself and give 1 to your employer / sponsor . if you already have a 6 month bank statement ; then you can readily apply for an rp . if not ; you can get your wife here on a visit visa and later convert it to rp . to apply for or visit visa ; get the visa form fill ( from same sofitel place ) and take it to any visa centre ( meisaimer center be good a it have good number of counter ) . all the best .

 it mainly affect local woman a they cover up too much . vit d be produce natuarally by your body on exposure to sun light . only in extreme case should you need supplement .
 vitamin d be use by the body to process calcium for the bone . it 's naturally occur when you 're in the sunlight . i strongly suggest that you take a walk after you eat right before sunset . make sure that you eat calcium containing product ( milk ; cheese ) as well a item from all the food group ( vegetable ; meat ; dairy ) . if you be lactose intolerant ; try take calcium supplement . it 's best if u allow your body to produce vitamin d naturally instead of take medication .
 this be very common in doha now a day ; cause yet to know.but frankly speak you do not mention here how much the value you have at present by the blood test revealed.as i do practice here first re-place the insuficiency by injection why ? ofcourse the potiency of the drug will rapidly get to the noraml target i.e . 30-8o . your doctor will investigate why you have this deficiency could be any reason for that . exposer to sun will just normally help every one but sudden low should be properly investigate.till then cheer ! !
 vitamin d dear all ; anyone can educate me about vitamin d. i be find deficient and even after a month of medication havent have a good result . but i have also notice that it seem to be a regional profile ; a lot of other woman i know have a deficient profile . thanks
 hi shinewood ; i be at a score of around 10 and this after a medication of 1.5 month . can vit d deficiency cause depression like symptom ? my doctor feel i may have an absorption issue . thanks all for respond
 this be what i would like to say early may be you have an issue of absorption problem.not only depression may take you many other problem
 this be bizzare ! the sunlight trigger vitamin d production . is n't there enough sun here ? of course ; if you cover up ; you 'll have to suffer .
 if the uv index be 2 ; 30 min in the sun expose a much of ur skin ; twice aweek at noon . uv2 in doha : from november to february . uv=3 10 min 2 time a week at noon . uv3 in doha : sept ; oct ; march ; april at noon summer before 11:00 and after 15:00
 drsam ... thats great info . noted .
 however all official study ca n't recommend sunlight exposure for vit d since toomany risk ( dna deterioration ; cancer skin ; sun stroke ; eye problem ... ) and to many parameter ( skin color ; location ; time ; uv index ; ... ) these official study stress on the intake or vit d. for the ultime reference ( a 1100+ page ) that sum up all research ; and all previous study : http : //books.nap.edu/openbook.php ? record not for faint hearted tho ! have a look .
 thanks drsam . do you know if deificiency can cause low mood ; anxiety etc
 the link between vitamin d deficeincy and depression ( bipolar disorder ; low-mood ... ) exist . scientific study place hypovitd a a risk factor ; not a trigger causal factor of depression . tablef-6 evidence map for neuropsychological functioning page 1022 http : //books.nap.edu/openbook.php ? record & page=1022
 polly ; i 'm sure the doctor might have suggest you weekly tablet and injection for vitamin d 's deficiency . you should add some nutritious food in your diet ; take full cream milk ; mixed fruit salad ; vegetable especially beet root ... it will improve your condition isa .

 lol not really what i be after but thanks !
 what be you really up to ? ( gunpowder be a mixture of sulfur ; charcoal ; and potassium nitrate ) .
 ha i be really up to amateur charcuterie ; not bomb make ! i use to buy it in the uk although it be difficult to get hold of for exactly the reason you mention ... . i use to make air dried ham ; bacon etc ; and saltpetre kill botulsim and keep the meat a nice pink colour . i be want to make kadid which be arabic air dry mutton ; to make a tasty couscous ! there must be some kind of chemical supply co. here ... ..
 you will need a special permit to bring any dual use chemical into the country ; include : 1 . civil defense + environmental commission + municipality approve storage facility 2 . importation of hazardous substance must be specifically mention on company cr . you can not import hazardous substance in your personal capacity . 3 . in addition to the above ; you will need to submit hazmat data sheet along with import document to custom with civil defense and environmental approval with each and every consignment . 4 . if material be classify a explosive or highly flammable ; you will also need to have the document approve by ministry of interior ( police ) . this apply to anything from paint thinner to you name .
 wow thanks ... ..but i do n't want to import it - i just want to buy a couple of hundred gramme . you mention that you would need to complete that process to import e.g . paint thinner - however paint thinner be available for retail purchase in store here ; so presumably the restriction be on retailer ; not retail buyer ... .. there must be a shop out there somewhere ! !
 why not you use salt a a substitute afterall we know that these nitrate be now link to so many type of cancer ?

 sports car ; manual be great.. ordinary car ; especially in doha traffic ; i prefer automatic..
 with this much traffic in doha wait in the r/b or step by step in alnasr street in the thursday even the automatic be the best but the most strong gearbox be the manual one any way drive safe : ) < a title= '' everything you need to know about living in doha ; qatar '' href= '' http : //www.qatarliving.com '' > < img src= '' http : //static.qatarliving.com/badges/150x50 '' alt= '' everything you need to know about living in doha ; qatar '' / > < /a >
 automatic ... .anywhere anytime ... . why to keep change gear ? 1 . in automatic the chance of error during change of gear speed especially at roundabout be zero . 2 . also with automatic one can use both hand to control the vehicle at r/abouts and dont have to keep shift gear thereby give improve control . the above 2 add to give one the split second advantage when other driver make some error and you can either slow down abruptly or give way swiftly . and of course one can slow down to a halt and then accelerate in an instant without go from 4th gear to 1st and then 2nd and 3rd & finally 4th . the only advantage manual have be the pickup one can get from 1st gear and the driver decide when to switch to a high gear and this be usually do faster manually .
 manual of course ; u can control the car more . plus ; sport car be manual..
 < b > if you be about buy a new car i suggest manual . or else automatic . u might have to face many issue with gearbox/cluth alone if the vehicle be old . in the current situation in doha ; many people will opt . for automatic transmission ; but even it a sporty or non sporty vehicle ; i love manual transmission . think about manul if you be buy a new one . < /b > `` never love a person you can live with ; always love a person you can never live without ''
 as i say above ... way more sexy ... but sadly it seem less than 25 % of car sell be manual these day ... at this rate they soon be extinct ... like the dinos ... ; (
 get automatic ; but if you love speed and sporty get manual..
 which do you prefer ; manual or automatic transmission ? why ? lol ... just share your thought
 automatic . hate the clutch .  call me one .
 here the reason why : : ) http : //www.metacafe.com/watch/72540/funny
 i would prefer manual may it be traffic jam or a long drive ; you can do anything you want with the car hehehehe and i hope manual shift wo n't be extinct . =dura lex sed lex=
 i 'm try to find a triptronic unit for my kia ... any idea ? ? i google ; but could n't find one..
 automatic/tiptronic . even when racing .
 for city traffic auto ; but for mountain and long road manual for sure ! there be nothing more fun then drive manual on steep curvy road : d tra la la
 automatic / triptronic be as good a a manual when u really need the initial acceleration ; if u have a good gear box which respond well .. it should n't matter if it automatic ur still gon na get the speed u require . with the traffic and roundabout here there 's no way i 'll ever drive a manual car here ! ! ! < span class= '' inline leave '' > < img class= '' image preview '' src= '' /files/images/coollogo '' alt= '' '' width= '' 237 '' height= '' 58 '' / > < /span >
 manual for offroad and auto for city traffic . peace .
 a/t v m/t : automatic give you more control over the steer wheel ( when you be in the middle lane of a 3 lane r/a ) a you can use both hand . with automatic also you can save fuel by go into neutral on straight stretch . you can also go into 1st gear ; 2nd gear & 3rd gear ! ! ! ( this be very useful while go uphill on a long mountainous terrain ) . < b/ > thus you can use automatic a a manual car but not viceversa < /b > and be there a cruise control for manual car ? it have the most fuel saving advantage on long route .
 automatic with invecs hi and lo : d that would be great !
 be sap worth it ? hi guy ; i be plan to go back to my country and get some training in sap ... it quite expensive ... so.. i be wonder if it the right thing to do.. be it worth it ? ?
 and now he be work with a very good company cadburys pune..
 sap be easy enough ; why do one need training in it . just practice on any mis software you can get your hand on .
 you have to quite your job here and get some hand own experience ; india be a good place with lot of opportunity to gain experience . thanks
 the most ; expensive ; useless ; labour intensive piece of junk ever write . no one use it a they should because it would take an army of technician ; engineer and accountant to fill every field and every step . so it get use only in part . ban sap ( stuningly atrocious program )
 sap be n't to difficult to learn ; but it need concentration . here 's this bit of news that be quite interesting . http : //education.yahoo.net/articles/study ? wid=1
 that 's because the demand be high and the supply be quite marginal .
 i know people in qatar who be unable to get job ; or even an interview call ; and they be certify ; with year of implementation experience . if you show patience and wait in india for at least sometime you could gain some experience and then come here .
 i know a few guy who get sap certification and go to saudi arabia ( aramco have the big sap site around ) or get job in usa / europe . the key be get your first job . best thing to do be talk to wipro or tcs and see if they can guarantee you a job after certification . good luck !
 beside to naimee cafeteria in maizar ... ... ... there be one mechanic ( osman ) from pakistan he be xcelet person in his field ... ... .. once i have the problem with my a/c and i go to showroom they say 3500qar n he do in 300qar ... ... ... ... all the best
 well i think if you want cheap ac filling then it in al aziziya ... behind the aziziya compound ... he charge 150 ... and he good in his work
 hi ; can any one tell me where can we fill the car a/c gas ? hi friend ; can any one tell me where can we fill the car a/c gas ?
 you only need to fill the car aircon if it 's not work . the gas should not leak out in normal use ; or disappear ; or shrink . if your aircon have stop work duev to a gas leak ; you can re-fill it which may last a few week or so - but repair be need if your gas be go . should be about qr150 to fill - but it will quickly become cheap to fix the leak .

 eating out any where in doha astronomical price ; some place u need to eat a sandwich will cost something like ten qatar riyal ( i.e +- 3 us $ ) the person who send the first reply to ur query have sum it up quite nicely and honestly here be some of his comment `` want to have a good time for less in the mideast ; go to dubai ; you 'll be spoil for choice with bar ; restaurant ; shop & activity to suit every pocket ... '' ... ... ... .. please give it a serious thought before u venture in for this expedition
 i totally agree 100 % with what garadene say ; you hit the nail on the head with your comment . if your look for a good time in this part of the world head to dubai ; it civalised with more variety ; without the red tape to get into bar ! ! !
 contrary to popular belief ; doha do n't want any tourist . ever . if you want to visit the gulf and have a nice time ; try visiting ; umm ; any place but doha . hotels be too expensive ; there be nothing for tourist to do ; and the authority have create rule to ensure that tourist do n't have fun . basically - tourist be n't want here . go someplace else .

 if your leave the country you need exit permit then they will stamp on your passport cancel .

 check the kids.. you will see it in them .
 yes ; fims do play a pivotal role in our life..i too agree to some extent that some portion or part of the film do create impact on our daily life and can even change the way of thinking and idea of someone..
 it depend on how the viewer perceive the film
 films can be use to convey a message to the audience . will we take heed of this message ?
 can film help change society ? read an interesting article about the power of film . the premise be that movie can send a message to the audience and thus help change society . an example give be `` the blind side '' . i saw this film ; love it ; but do it help me become a good person ? i do n't know.. recently ; someone state `` people get their value from the silver screen . '' would you agree ?
 brit - it deoends on how effectively the message be put across ... .some message hit the nail rite on the head while others take a subtle approach ... .
 films indeed change my life ... watching movie like basic instinct - 1 ; 2 have change my life drastically ... . : (
 when chaiya chaiya song from dil se movie be show i saw so many kid run and dance on small toy train ; than daler mehandi appear with hi bolo tarara and tutak tutak tutiyan ... .by song a list be long for indian cinema becao we start dance on the current tune in the marriage and function like kajra rey kajra rey or beedi jalai ley.. than come dress of heroin or hero.. than come some dialogue ... mein hoon na than come marriage stage or dress or home designing concept too . yes society really move not much but still a lot in indian cinema..
 i get confuse ; but what i think you 're say that bollywood influence how people dress . that 's fair enough . but what about send out a moral/ethical/religious message . do bollywood film help you perhaps become a good person ?
 all bollywood movie do be make girl yearn for hopelessly romantic never to be find in real life partner : - ) movies have effect on one 's mood but nothing in long term i think as long a we be watch it know that it fiction .
 since long time americans be get inspiration from their hollywood ; look at rambo type movie ; perhaps they need another episode to capture osama and taliban 's leader .
 i do think film have an effect on some a lotta people in society . i do like `` the blind side '' ; it be a beautiful film and i remember read an article later about a few people be take in by that movie and legally adopt afro-american kid like him . nomerci be right about the action flick and well a the chick-flicks . rags to riches movie also do have an effect on the less fortunate who strive hard to complete their education and work harder to get notice .
 life itself be a movie .
 depends on the kind of film ... definitely not bollywood ; that 's for sure ... oh actually wait ... bollywood flick do help change society ... for the worse ; by turn people into moron ... like the one on screen ... but if we look at foreign film ; indie film ; low budget non-mainstream film ; true story rendition ; etc ... they would definitely have some sort of positive effect on society because more often than not ; they 're base on & depict everyday reality ; something that the audience can connect with ...

 did you ever watch gandhi or dune ?
 of course the mass media/movie production can change society . but i would n't use word `` help '' . `` help '' be something positive ; while mass production can affect society very negatively . movie can definitely form a certain image ; pattern behavior ; stereotype ; etc . all film company reduce the number of smoke scene in their film ; some of them have ban these scene completely . movie create stereotype that be follow by people . girls want to look ; to be dress and to behave a their favorite actress . guys want to act like their hero act . this be normal process . brit ; one separate movie might not help one individual become well ( but also might help ) ; but create a whole image of certain behavior and stereotype in the society definitely can make this society well ( or bad )

 you can learn the basic from a friend who be a muslim ; i guess .
 basic islam is there such a place here in doha where the newly convert go just learn the basic of islam like how to perform pray and other basic thing that every muslim should know ? when i check with al fanar back in july 2012 ; they do n't any class for newly convert . thank you .
 you can go to fanar and take some book about islam and by the way it 's free .
 try to call 44250288 ; this be the muslim integration section of fanar ; they do have basic class there both for men and woman ; especially on fridays . they will teach you the basic of prayer ; pillar of islam ; pillar of faith as well a comparative study .
 pls call mr. asif 66557786.. he be member of fanar and good faith follower ..he will help u out .
 yes when the self proclaim expert busy themselves with issue 'fatwas ' against film star and cricketer ; the misguided extremism and strife inevitably follow..do n't know where you 're from but the scholar in india be too pre-occupied with salman khan and zaheer khan to have any time to educate people on the true islam . and hey ; do you notice how one comment direct the op to 'ql user fathima ' for info ? . as they say ; a person 's reputation precede them..mashallah : - )
 yes ; mohdata you be right one be to self study but internet be not the correct option always ; due to several mis information about islam . we could uphill to surf most reliable website and join the religious teach group of ql . check here ... http : //www.islamicacademy.org/
 check the various topic cover on this website . http : //www.islamicacademy.org/
 i seriously doubt about srk and salman 's religion ! just get a birth in a muslim family do not make a person muslim ; otherwise the son of prophet nuh ( peace be on him ) would be a muslim . everybody need to strive for knowledge of islam and implement the rule and discipline in their personal life .
 maybe bro maybe ... but how will know whether or not these star be muslims ; benefit u ? in fact ; may allah protect u ; by waste time try to find out about their place in islam ; we can commit big sin and even lose our islam ; due to our lack of knowledge on thing that be far more pressing . but yes you be right ; be bear to a muslim family do not make one a muslim ; and i know this firsthand ; sadly ; due to the state of my own family and who i be less than ten year back ; astaghfirullah !
 buddy i say let 's all keep our house in order and the rest will automatically fall in place . besides ; it be not any person 's place to judge others and their standing in allah 's sight . we do not know how allah judge u . it be possible salman khan be more dear to god than you or me because of some small good deed he do sometime . if a 100 time murderer and a prostitute be forgive and grant heaven for merely water a thirsty dog ; salman stand a good chance too allah willing . so yeah let 's all pray for each other and keep our own islam strong : - )
 you state you be 'a certain way ten year back ' . i get your intention and be sure you do n't plan to anyway but please do not mention any more detail of why or how you be a bad or lose muslim . the reason i say that be because people frequently curiously ask for more details..and we in good faith spill all our beans..but allah frequently veil for u our sin from the world and people because he intend to forgive those sin . i too have be and still be a somewhat lost muslim but alhamdulillah god have shield all those sin from people and inshallah it will only be between me and him . thus we should not openly declare what allah have mercifully hide for u . and i hope we be not hijack the thread..well we be but not really lol
 basic islam is there such a place here in doha where the newly convert go just learn the basic of islam like how to perform pray and other basic thing that every muslim should know ? when i check with al fanar back in july 2012 ; they do n't any class for newly convert . thank you .
 guess my intention of say so be to specify more why i do n't judge people due to y'know.. but you be absolutely right ; jazakhallah khair for your advice . as always we be all in need of one another for advice and help . may allah truly forgive u all ; increase u in knowledge and grant u success in this world and the next..aameen and yes that be a hijack ; but hopefully it will be view a a `` good '' one !
 more distraction and love for this materialistic world snatch peace from our life . peace of mind and soul be not easily available . we all need to strive to attain spirituality and peace .
 you can try www.islamhouse.com
 i hope you be not be awkward ; rude or condescend with that comment ; since your message be n't too clear
 they have people who work or volunteer at fanar that would help any new convert . if you still have not find someone to help you ; please contact me and i will help you if you be a lady ; if you be a man i can find someone to help you .
 oh ok ... no idea why that 's happen though . hopefully the mod will sort it out co i 'm really look forward to hear from you . barakhallah feeki

 and be tell by staff that it be now all go . initial shipment only last about 3 day . they do expect another shipment next week . but that 's after thanksgiving . i have never see it at any other grocery store in doha besides megamart . if you really need to make pumpkin pie ( and what would thanksgiving be without one ! ) then it really be quite easy to buy a whole pumpkin ; cut it up and cook it down . there should be real pumpkin . i know they have them at wholesale market and megamart still . check the internet for recipes/directions . good luck .

 where can woman seek some legal advice ? i be a female overseas contract worker here in qatar who be a victim of estafa . what government agency should i go to ask some legal advice ?
 ministry of human rights somewhere in westbay
 what be estafa ?
 if estafa be what mj say ; then what human right can do with that ? honestly ; i think nobody can do anything about it ; unless there be a legal write contract of lending/borrowing money . even in this case the procedure be way too long and you might end up with give to the lawyer much more money than you be owe ... < i > < b > ********************* you become responsible forever for what you have tame . antoine de saint-exupry < /b > < /i > < img src= '' http : //cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif '' >
 you have 3 option . you may lodge a complaint or blotter with any near police station . if he be a foreigner ; the police will give him a visit together with your complaint . if the respondent will not own up ; they can file your complaint with the prosecutor . if the respondent be qatari ; you go to the ministry of human rights and they will assist you there . you may also try your embassy which normally have legal officer familiar with local criminal procedure to assist you . good luck .
 qatar criminal and civil procedure be unique in the entire gulf region . it have both the regular court and the sharia court . for estafa or deceit ; it be normally file with a complaint with the prosecutor and after preliminary investigation ; it will be file with the court of first instance . you need not hire a lawyer since the prosecutor will be your lawyer . but bear in mind to produce evidence on estafa or deceit . if you have no documentary exhibit forget your complaint and charge it to experience . sharia court handle family relation law and criminal case involve qataris and muslim litigant . cases involve foreigner ; civil or criminal be handle by regular court .
 evidence be very important in criminal prosecution . oral testimony will not prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt ; the quantum of evidence require to convict an accuse in a criminal prosecution . the rejoinder of qatarisun be well take ; your respondent can easily deny have receive money from you or simply say that the money be simple loan ; and you have no case for estafa . the essential element of estafa be `` trust '' and `` exchange of good or money '' . prove this both and you have a case for estafa .
 the formality or informality of your document be immaterial . what be material for your case to prosper in ourt be the substance of your document . it must show the nature of your transaction ; mention the good or money he receive ; his name and signature thereon ; and any witness to the transaction . if you part good or money base on his representation ; and which you awfully trust ; and his promise or acknowledgement of pay you back ; and he renege on this promise ; then you have a criminal case for deceit or estafa .
 there you have it ; your reference to the word `` borrow '' presuppose the existence of a simple loan ; and your allegation for estafa be doom . electronic mail or email be now admissible in evidence in court under certain qualification . but what you have on hand be evidence of simple loan not estafa . in which case ; if the amount involve be substantial ; you be advise to seek a local lawyer to assist you in file a simple case for sum of money and damage . legal fee here be quite expensive ; prepare with your deep wallet .
 ms j ; promissory note be not evidence of estafa but of loan . promissory note be ancillary document to the principal contract of loan . if one can not pay his loan ; you do not sue him for estafa even if this be accompanied promissory note and with rubber check . issuance of bounching check be not punishable a a crime in qatar if that be what you have in mind .
 i have an evidence . an email conversation a an evidence of borrow money and the promise to pay .
 where can woman seek some legal advice ? i be a female overseas contract worker here in qatar who be a victim of estafa . what government agency should i go to ask some legal advice ?
 thank you for the response .
 rimlaw ... so what be the safe way of transaction ? since cheques & promissory note be not enforceable .
 cheques and promissory note be admissible in evidence for civil case such a collection cases for sum of money ; judicial foreclosure of mortgage ; etc . but not for ciminal prosecution of estafa or deceit . while check may have probative value to establish motive or intent it be not the quantum of proof to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt . promissory notes on the other hand will disprove estafa since this document will clearly establish a loan transaction . the safe way in transaction involve forebearance of money or exchange of good for money be to have a contract or document that clearly specify the nature of transaction . never get sway by sweet talk person and you might end up scammed .
 lulu hyper on d-ring ; there be an optician shop inside . that 's where i go .

 thank you so much for the feedback ! ! i appreciate it : )
 well ; usually the ideal way to use or hook up be the worm ; but u jus cant find them in here ; we use hardened wheat flour ; sardines also ; a fake small fish ; with smell . u can buy them at the shop . i havent try it yet ; see your luck ; and let u know wat u have catch ! i miss fish at new york ; hudson river ; ontario lake !
 i think u can find in shop where sell fishing rod ; hook etc.. because last time when i be byuing a fishing rod i saw there in bottle and i ask the shopkeeper and he tell me this be worm use for fishing . the shop be locate in somewhere in souq in between islamic meusium roundabout and clock roundabout . somewher same line with galaxy sports.ther be 2 or 3 shop ... io think
 sparkle ; it depend what and where you want to fish ; i guess for sherry kalamari or squid work well ; for baracuda sardine or mackarel ; you can even try a lure ; rapala sxr 14 be good for beach casting ; for safi you can try wheat flour mix ; shrimp be effective but doesnt work if you want to cast some distance ; hope it help and yes for most of the bait you should buy either from fish market or lulu .tight line .
 i dont think there be place where u can get worms/baits/lures here ... for bait and lure ; i guess it best to order online.. you can check out a whole list of option in the link below : http : //www.fishinfo.com/resources/lures.htm

 both the wife and i use kindles here in doha . the wireless obviously do not work ; but you can download book to the pc easily and put them on the kindle . books be way cheaper this way and a much good selection than any store in doha . i have no idea about mac compatibility . i suggest you check out amazon.com and find out .
 ditto what the first poster say . i have the kindle ; friend have the sony reader ; and both work fine here in doha . you just download to your computer and transfer over to the reader . since you can basically use an iphone like an electronic reader ( i have another friend who do that here ) ; i suspect there should be no problem use them with either pc or mac format . but check online to be sure . just my two cent : they be so much good than book ! ! ! cheaper to buy individual text ; much easy to travel with ... i get tire of wait for a decent bookstore to come to this country . it never will . so cut out the middle man and just do it this way . only wish i have get mine sooner !
 i need to figure out how to download book and move them over manually . have any of you figure out how to do newspaper ? i 'd love to get the international herald tribune back ...

 i think those loan up to a certain amount be insure with the insurance company and bank will get their money back from the insurance .
 sorry ; i forget to ask . why you be interested in such an issue ? is it only curiosity ?
 if you leave qatar without pay your personal loan ; definitely a case will be file against you then you will be blacklist in the immigration . you should never visit qatar again or else you 'll land in the prison cell . yes ; personal loan be insured but bank ca n't recover it thru default or non payment . insurance be for life only ; mean applicable only if the borrower die .
 there be bank here that be also available in your country even if you will not come back they have authorize agency to confiscate whatever you have in your country
 first of all such act be non recommendable ; by the way all bank be have very strong network all over the world ; they will trace the person out whereever he be ; then u can imagine what they will do ; and secondly within middle east they will black list the person and they will make the person life miserable .
 bank or any lending institution extend such lending to you specially expats on the merit of your integrity thru your sponsor sometimes . they grant loan even they do not know you 100 % ; and you should be thankful to such lending institution . the first thing you should do be to go to the bank and settle everything or else you will be face many consequence in the event you run away from such responsibility . there be a say that say good karma begets good karma.bad karma will likewise begets bad karma . think about this .
 about personal loan what would the bank do if some expat who happen to have personal loan at a certain bank here ; then decide to go home and never come back ?
 what will happen if the compani be terminate ? ? ?

 where be migrate bird stay i have see lot of bird over doha during evening time . guess they migrate here in winter . do any one know which area ( beach ) they stay be stay ?
 the reason bird migrate be that they be avoid the cold weather brewing in the place they be stay so they move to warmer country . there be a possibility they be just `` pass through '' doha when you notice them . scientifically ; bird can travel thousand of mile so it 's possible doha be not their final stop . they might have head towards iran or beyond ... once they know that the weather in their place have warm up ; they go back .
 i have hear ; bird see on dubai terminal ; try hard to catch up their next flight ; therefore ; security officer object them lol ; to proceed ; guess what ; lol no transit visa lol ;
 juliarose ; if u happen to look carefully ; the bird be come from iran ( the north side ) where the weather be more cold be go south to warmer / tropical climates . there be two type of migration : long-distance migration ; & short-distance migration . as per my knowledge ; some short-distance migrating bird stay in warm region of saudi arabia along the red sea coast ; whereas some more specie travel to egypt ; sudan and far to ethiopia . for long-distance migration ; bird fly as far a south africa too . more information can be find on wikipedia .

 there be no rule in qatar for the air ticket and stuff . it will depend on the offer they provide to you . i mean what offer they mention in your labour contract . so a baldrick2dogs say ; u can either cash out economy class fair or fly use a business class . simple !
 i would suggest take the business class travel offer much better.. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - he who dares wins
 iata fair be 50 % + more than the normal fair ; if my calculation be not wrong .
 yv2r baldrick have reply very correct ; if you want your company to issue a ticket ; it will be business class or if you want to encash the ticket money you will get only economy fare . all airlines be approve by iata ; mean international air transport association ; agent who have iata approval will follow rule and regulation ; there be many agent who dosent have this iata ; they give less price mean ; to survive in competitve market they share their comission what they get from iata agent with the passenger.dealing with approve iata agent be always beter .

 nope ; completely illegal . your employer should have get you a business visit visa . it allow for work in qatar on a temporary basis . mandi
 work on visitor visa how long can one work in qatar with just visitor visa ; iff at all ? cheer
 to work on a visit visa ; not for money and not even for free . otherwise you must apply for a business visa .
 to have business visa ; and/or on arrival visa these be the only 2 visa allow you to work in qatar . and by the way these 2 visa be extendable ; business visa you can extend for another 2 month ; and the on arrival visa you can extend for another one month .
 cheers for imput ; now where be the best hotel for brunch on friday ?
 mohammad jabr ; visa on arrival be a tourist visa by it nature ; with only difference that for the certain nationality this tourist visa be available at the airport upon arrival ; without apply in advance in their coutries . but it be still tourist visa ; and therefore it be illegal to work on the type of visa.. the only legal work visa for the short-term employment/consultancy/ internatioanl company meeting and worksops ; etc . be a business visa .
 within 10 work day they will call you for sure ; b4 they come . be there to receive the technician ! !
 accord to qtel it will take at least 7 work days.. but in our case..it take 10 working day due to line problem ...
 for qtel issue ; we know who to turn to ...
 thanks saeedhan ; i do wish to eep my old number so let 's hope you be right about the 3 day . my problem be that i do not know the qtel number of the new house and i think i need to give that information to qtel in order to apply for the transfer ? sigh : )
 thanks saeed ... it be a villa and there be no such plate outside the door ... i guess i will have plenty of time to look for it when i move in tomorrow and no internet to distract me from the task ... . one more question ... i have a package include internet ; landline and movile line ... will they disconnect my mobile line at all during the process or only the internet and landline . thanks : )
 3 day ? ? ? ? yeah right ... 10 day on average but there be a way to get it do faster ... let 's hope the great one read your thread ; ) there be a a great guy on ql who can solve your problem immediately but i wonder whether he will be online today ... .
 moving house - how long will qtel take ? i be move to a new villa this weekend . does anyone now how long qtel take to move internet and landline ; how long will i be without a connection ? i have n't speak to them yet ; just want to get the general idea ...
 spicymum ; no ; 20 calendar day . depends on which neighborhood you be move to . some area be `` easy '' for q-tel than others . i move to gharrafa 2 year ago and it take them 6 week to hook up my phone line and internet . when i move to al-sadd it take them 10 day .
 it 's not about what you know ; it 's about who you know ... .
 it be call wasta ... ..
 qtel branch in landmark and in city center be open from 10am-10pm from sat-thu and from 4pm-10pm on fridays . your husband work until 10pm 7 day a week ?
 wow ; i just read the end of this thread a i just get my internet connection back after 2 week . wow ichwill what an unhelpful and negative comment ! ! ! qtel smsed the reference number and appointment date ... nearly a week after we apply to move the line ( at the main qtel office by te way ) . phew ! but then ; they do n't turn up on the appointment date . when i call to complain they say they have call and we do n't pick up ; but no missed call on either of our phone . we be issue with another date a week after the initial date ( today ) and thank goodness they turn up this time and my line be work again . i guess 2 week without a connection be n't that bad ; i actually expect bad .
 if you be under your father sponsorship then you do n't need to change your sponsorship ; you only need a no objection letter from your father allow you to work . if you say you have a job line up then your future employer will have to arrange the job contract and have it endorse my the ministry of labour
 for me an asian here 's what i have do -first fill up a work permit form from labor office ( you can go to the office or from the web ) fill it up in arabic and complete all the requirement list at the back page ( except the police clearance ) -bring the complete work permit form with attachment to labor office and they will give you a schedule/endorsement letter for police clearance ( they will not take your complete form or monetary payment unless you have the result of your police clearance ) -after a week when you have the endorsement letter from labor office you have to go to police clearing office at salwa ; fill up police clearance form with requirement list at the back ; you could wait for a week or two for the result . -lastly you have to go back to labor office with your 1 . completed work permit form with all the attachment ( list at the back ) 2 . result of your police clearance 3 . payment and in the same day they will provide you with your work permit id or you can ask the company 's mandoop to do that for you ( a lot easy : - ) )
 ok thanx alot for the reply.i dont want to work illegally . so i just have to get my father to type up a no objection letter and give it to my employer ? thanx in advance
 -work permit qar500 -stamping your contract with english arabic translation qar 30 -police clearance +/- qar50 ( i forget ; sorry ) -spending on send and receive ; to and from your country attest document copy ( list at the back of the form ) ; and attestation on doha ( varies base on your country and their process i guess ) cheers !

 hi ! the problem -from my point of view- be not get one of those model there in doha ; the thing be get one in a good price . it seem to me that the price for those model be very high there ; thats why im say im go there with very low expectation .
 btw ; i go there yesterday for a small part ( which be cheap ! ) . the salesman tell me that all the price have increase 30 % ! ! ! ! ! ! < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/photos/b '' title= '' monotone mia by baldrick2dogs ; on flickr '' > < img src= '' http : //farm4.static.flickr.com/3389/3262305312 '' width= '' 240 '' height= '' 97 '' alt= '' monotone mia '' / > < /a >

 www.ebay.com
 hi ! i need a camera like that because im a photojournalist ; and im work for a newspaper . im cover a lot of event ; and i need a `` top of the line '' camera . and no ; im not yet in qatar ; im be there soon ; thats why im ask for help ; i want to buy a new camera there ; specifically a canon eos 1d mark iii 10.1mp digital slr camera ( body only ) . even when i know everyone say it more expensive there ; any help be welcome !

 top of the line camera from canon be 1ds mkiii - i think not available in salam - the available camera be 1d mkiii ( without `` s '' ) and it cost around qr20 . or top ot the line from nikon d3x ( also not see in salam ) - the available be d3 ( without `` x '' ) with almost similar price with canon 1d mkiii . it 's depend on your lens you have now - if you have canon lens then you should buy canon body . i do not know what kind of journalist be you - sport journalist or indoor journalist . for sport definitely nikon be the best ; but for indoor canon much better.. but why do you buy g10 ? it be not for journalist -- i use g10 only for travel - for documentation / photography i use my dslr..

 you can ask for khulla..file the case with valid reason . they will call for hearing in the court.tell them every thing .then they will decide within a week ... kid will be with you . but first question where do you marry .it can be happen if you marry in doha .
 we get marry in qatar
 divorce can i get divorce in sharia court on the ground that i have not see my husband for more than a year.who will get custody over our child age 3 year and 6 months.the young one he have not even see .how long the divorce procedure will take ?
 try to see whats go on with him first take care of 2 kid by a single mom be hard ; even though if someone else will help . think it over & over b4 take this step .. believe my it a very big one . call him .. see what you can reach to .. then think about divorse .
 most of the major brand of laptop these day be good ; especially the one you mention . i have try ; toshiba ; hp ; lg until i switch to mac . acer be now the number 2 laptop maker in term of sale ( just saw it on cnn last night ) . maybe you could give it a try .
 you ca n't get a mac for 1.500 qr !
 i guess only acer sell for 1500. rest all be around 1800 - 2000 - 2500 range . i even read acer have one for around qr1000 . its obvious the resellers dont want to push the low price one a it give them low margin . eg 10 % on 2000 = 200 ( which be at least something ) 10 % on 1000 = 100 ( almost nothing )
 you can get fujitsu siemens for qr1500 . aana free ; jaana free ; pakde gaye tho khana free .
 or hp mini qr1399 . aana free ; jaana free ; pakde gaye tho khana free .
 go for hp ... best value for money
 there be lot of online review of the netbooks you mention ; most of which speak highly of the samsung ; acer aspire one and hp mini . with these netbooks your personal preference of keyboard size ; screen size ; touchpad layout and battery life be more important than the processor speed ; a they pretty much all use the same atom processor now . i recently buy the hp mini 2140 from lulu centre for qar 1388 ; and i be very happy with it . it cost between us $ 450 to $ 550 online ; so it seem like a good buy . note that the lulu one only have the 3 cell battery ; which last around 2.5 hr ; vs the 6 cell battery with 5 hr or more . the 6 cell battery can be purchase online for around qar200 if you need to use it for long period without a power socket . a friend have three different netbooks and like the samsung best . unfortunately for him ; it have a heat failure and have be return for repair . i also like the look of the aspire one and the toshiba ; a they have slightly taller screen ( 1024x600 vs 1024x576 on the hp ) ; and square touchpad . on the weekend i saw them at jarir bookstore ( opposite ramada ) with 6 cell battery for qar1499 . i be think of get one of these to try along side the 2140 ; but just ca n't really justify have two . most likely your decision will come down to which one you think look best ; after all ; they 're more of an accessory than a computer . they also come in red ; with flower ; so get the right one ; or you will have to buy a new handbag and pair of shoe ! jason
 i 'd take an hp over an acer any day . they seem so slow . mine be so slow i give it away to my two neices for xmas and buy a 'real ' laptop . < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/photos/b '' title= '' the pearl development panorama by baldrick2dogs ; on flickr '' > < img src= '' http : //farm4.static.flickr.com/3351/3615935822 '' width= '' 240 '' height= '' 57 '' alt= '' the pearl development panor

 you think the offer be low ? then forget it and look elsewhere . but ; if you do n't have any high offer yet ; and have nothing to do with your time ; why do n't you give it a try . ... listen to the sound of silence ... .
 whats the position ; and what 's your nationality . pay be base on your race here . 3000 per month be a ridiculously low salary consider what the cost of living be . you 'd probably be live in a shack and be treat like dirt . shameful people offer such low salary in a country with the high per caput in the world .
 it depend on which position ; ; the question in this forum be always incomplete ; and the guy want u the reader to guess and reply ! ! ! ! if the job offer be for a officeboy / peon ; the salary be good ! ! ! ! if you have no job at hand and really in desperate mood ; the salary be good ! ! ! !

 do americans need a work visa in qatar ? i 'm interested in relocate to qatar and be curious what the requirement be to make that happen ?
 find yourself a job in qatar..you will automatically get a work visa . < a href= '' http : //photobucket.com/images/funny '' target= ''  '' > < img src= '' http : //i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg12/n-a-t-a-s-j-a/funny/smile.gif '' border= '' 0 '' alt= '' smile pictures ; images and photos '' / > < /a >
 work visa be link to a job in a qatari company . you ca n't get one . your employer would supply it .
 step 2 : the employer will take care of the visa . make sure they arrange for your family to come to .
 all ; thank you for the insightful response . i 'm an operation manager in the fmcg industry the u.s and have 5+ year of management experience in the field of supply chain ; logistics and warehouseing . are there any good recruiting agency ; which i can utilize to help guide my search ? contact information ? websites ? thank you again for your help .
 i do n't mean to be discourage to you by any stretch but most people do n't just up and relocate to qatar . we be bring by specific company for certain position . that 's why westerners can be pay a considerable amount of money - they be recruit and hire from overseas because of a very particular set of skills/experience need by a firm in qatar . when our contract be over we will ; nay must ; however sadly return to our home country . it be not a free-market economy . there be some generic recruiting agency but your best bet be directly with a company that need your specialized skill or a headhunter act on that company 's behalf . if you have n't a skill that be in high demand ( i.e . transplant surgeon ) you will be compete for job with people from close country which traditionally tend to underbid their service . mandi
 http : //www.gulftalent.com/home/index.php http : //www.keyresourcesinc.com/ another couple of known agency around middle east and they do respond to your application ; i recommend it to some of my friend and they be lucky enough to find a job from them . i use to know a lot of this agency but i change computer ; i could n't find them again . but will look for it in a next couple of day or so . cheers ! < p align= '' center '' > < a href= '' http : //www.wilsoninfo.com '' target= ''  '' > < img src= '' http : //i213.photobucket.com/albums/cc229/wil5037/tweety.gif '' border= '' 0 '' alt= '' free clipart '' > < /a > have a nice day !

 do not ; i repeat ; do not attempt to buy alcohol from the duty free and bring it here ... they will take it =.. (
 all the * hotel will serve you alcohol ... ... only if you be stay with them ... ..only in your room . aana free ; jaana free ; pakde gaye tho khana free .
 meet your friend and take him to dubai . and definitely do n't have the so-called non-alcoholic beer .
 kia ! ! ! ! but i be bias . everything about the kia be good - service centre ; show room ; the car ! ! ! ! especially the mohave ! seriously though ; i go to get my kia service and be in and out within one hour ! they even offer u a hire car whilst ours be be service ; but we choose to wait instead .
 hyundai and kia . like lexus and toyota . kia be own by hyundai . they both share technology ; engine ; transmission and electricals . just differ in look . i know that kia spare part be ridiculously expensive and available only in agency . hyundai be the best compare to kia .
 neither ! both be korean car and have poor resale value ... .only my 2 cent worth advice .
 when i be in korea in 2002 i ask some koreans what be the best local automaker by their oppinion ? all of them tell me that it 's hyundai .
 hyundai and kia be both control by the same korean parent . but japenesse cars like toyota have better quality . but if you had to pick choose between hyundai and kia pick hyundai . becouse also the resale price of kia is not good . hope the above helps : bye

 hi there call 5567196 ; they will help you with all plump & electrical material with work .
 nice go monna where else but your friendly hardware .
 you could also check out ansar city on salwa road just after the teyseer petrol station . they have all kind of stuff . most of it be from china though .
 well ; - if you be come from cinema signal and go to the hot bread bakery ; keep go strait on that road you 'll find shop on both side ; you also could keep go strait to you reach the next signal then turn right `` haraj '' there be a lot of hardware store there
 go back to qdc they will tell you what to do picture on the card so that they can not sell any one if your picture be on the card also security be not allow the person into the shop if the picture be not match with real one that be why they be take picture when you renew your licence
 oh my. ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! .. of all the card you lose the one that matter most ... looks like the festival must have be a dry one for you and the guy you share it with
 yes i be all break up about it . i 'd appreciate it if you have some useful information to add . : )
 for anyone who have this problem ... i find out that the qdc be happy to replace your card at no cost as long a you can bring your qatar id down to the shop . nice to see this be not a big hassle . i guess they want to make sure you can spend your money on booze and swine ! : )
 qnb notes ! ! ! ! be it a good idea ? ? what do you think about the qnb note ? ? is it a good idea for investment ?
 dont know ; whats a qnb note ?
 qnb note be an investment product where the capital be guaranteed - so at the end of the investment period you be at least guarantee your initial investment . the investment be link to the performance of the qatar stock exchange over the next 2 year . obviously nobody know how the stock market will do but i be pretty confident that over the next 2 year the investment should do good than the return on a fixed deposit inshallah ! so if you have an investment strategy that involve equity then this product have get little downside - principal guarantee so if all else fail - it just the opportunity cost on the money for 2 year - versus the upside of the qatar stock market . dont need to be an einstein to figure this one out ... .
 you should be able to do the same by follow these two simple step ; 1 . take 75 % of the total amount you want to put into this scheme into a high yielding fix deposit scheme with any major like cbq . 2 . the remain 25 % ; invest in equity yourself . if the market do well ; you will make much more than you will with the note ; if the market fare very badly ; you will still have earn interest on the fixed deposit to offset the 25 % loss on your equity investment portfolio . rgds ; j.j
 my two bit be ; ; that min . investment be qar . 20 k for a tenor of 2 year . if u put 20 k in bank ; u get max . 6 % per annum.. i think ; that in two year . qe will give u at least return of 6 % p.a keep in view ; the qe at around 7300 nowadyas.. the bad scenario be that u will get your 20 k back after 2 years.. having invest directly in qe directly ; i have burn my hand . however ; i still be in favour of qnb note 1 ; due to it timing . as qe be still not go too high .
 i be also interested in this .. and like to know more about it .. i be watch : ) ..please update more
 i think it would be allow as long a you do n't buy a t-shirt with a qatarsucks print on it
 i dont think there be any problem . but for your curiosity well to check with doha port . or anybody who be work in doha port can guide you good .
 thank you johnpu ... .

 advice for new comer to qatar can anyone please share his/her experience of enter qatar first time on a work visa . what be the thing one should avoid and what be the tip etc etc ... i will be move from saudi to qatar soon and all advice and tip in this regard will be highly appreciate . salman
 just be yourself ...
 you would need 1500 to cover decent food and travelling .
 look up the hotel in doha . most charge 1000 for one night !
 guy ... .do n't discourage him.let him come and have a good time.he could find cheap hotel for 150 riyal per night in some remote are like national ; souq area etc and have food decently with 75 riyal per day and 400 to 500 riyal for local shopping.site seeing and taxi rent will cost another 500 riyals.so all together qr.2500 approx.its more than enough for a decent stay .
 maybe he want to say 10000 and miss one zero lol . at that time it be enought . but 1000 nooooooooo wayyyyyyyy
 if you be get a job in any other gcc country then it mean you 'll need to apply for a valid local dl in that country . if you be go to any gcc on a `` tourist '' base then yes it be valid . regards ! !
 i know that you can use a qatari driving license support by your qatari rp to rent a car in the uae ; but if you leave here to work there would imagine you need to do a test for the uae ; unless your home license can be automatically transfer . should also imagine that once your rp be cancel your qatari license irrespective of date on it would also be cancel .
 your qatar dl be valid in qatar & can be convert to omani license ; bahrain ; kuwait but not uae . u need give test in uae.if you fail u need to take class open file and keep try your luck . get uae license be not so easy a u get in qatar . u need good luck and if not u shed lot money in attempt . overall ur qatari license be not valid to get uae dl . u need to go through above process .
 i get my driver 's licence in saudi arabia and when i transfer here in qatar ; it be still valid for 2 month . i be able to convert it to qatar driver 's licence because saudi and qatar be part of gcc . i just do n't know if this be also applicable if you go out of qatar and convert it to uae driver 's license when you work there . but i have a strong feeling that it can be do since uae be also part of gcc .
 i be from uae ; have valid uae license ; i confirm no other gcc or asian dl can be directly convert to uae dl . apply for a road test if u pas ur lucky.if u fail u need to take minimum 5 class . then try till u succeed .
 qatar driving license will be valid in all gcc countries hi all ; i be have qatar driving license ; will this license will be valid in all gcc country ? if i get a job in uae ; this qatar driving license will be valid in uae ; or again i want to apply for drive license .
 yes it be valid in all gcc country . once you get the uae residency you go to the uae traffic department with the original qatari licence and copy too ; you pay 100 dirhams and get the uae driving licence
 no free course .

 hey ; i know that www.qbay.com ( the ebay site for qatar ) will be available but i do n't know when . someone be tell me that it will be very safe because you need to enter your qatar mobile number into the site and then varify your identity with an sms code . clever stuff ? ? it will keep the scammer away im sure
 thanks for the answer guy . just want to confirm that aramex be safe ...
 i be a permanant ebay shopper . i would advise you to always check the feedback of the seller . do n't buy if the seller 's positive feedback be low than 99 % .
 i buy from all three place plus mwave.com ; zipzoomfly.com and amazon.com . i use bongo u mail forward a they consolidate shipment . with aramex ; each parcel be ship separately and there be a minimum charge . so if you buy a memory card that weigh next to nothing you pay $ 30 or so . i believe aramex then charge about $ 8 us per pound for heavy parcel . bongo consolidate - gather all your parcel and weigh them a if they be one . they ship all your parcel a one shipment . you will save hundred of dollar over a year of shipment . i have get shipment that i have pay only $ 6 a pound for and save on consolidation . check them out they be fantastic . http : //www.bongous.com/parcel aramex should wake up and provide consolidation service . dhl be also laughable a they do not consolidate . fedex be never go to do that a they make too much on commercial shipment .
 first check yourself you are a male or female then ask question / help crazy kabayan

 in badie it depend on the brand you buy brand like ibanez be from 1500 to 3000
 acoustic electric guitar they be very nice
 all those sound quite boring ... : /
 well ; it 's a tough time to arrive ; that 's for sure ! there be western-oriented place that can be visit during the day ; but you 'll have to remember that there be no eating ; drinking ; smoking or gum-chewing allow while out during the day . that say ; here be a few place i know that be open at least for a little while ; each day and then also in the evening . carrefour - 9 a.m. - 1 a.m. sat-thurs - villagio & city center megamart- 8:30 a.m. - 1 a.m. sat-thurs - landmark ; the centre just about all the mall be open from 10 a.m. to around 1 or 2 and then re-open around 8 in the evening ; so you can get a few hour of shopping in during the day and then go back at night if you run out of time . i understand the iftar buffet be marevelous and serve at most hotel . that would be your late evening meal ; and well worth the wait from what i 'm told ( i 've only be here since late july ; so i have n't have a chance to do all the ramadan thing offer yet ) find a reliable taxi driver ; and you 'll be all set to pop around to the various mall to get well acclimate to the area . once the heat ease off in a couple month ; it would be easy to get around by get a drop off at a central location and then walk around the city a bit . get a marhaba at a bookstore if you do n't already have one ; it be the best resource for all this kind of stuff ! have fun !

 i have be involve in business and marketing plan and development before . conducting a feasibility study in this case will help u answer ur question . but ; first thing ; u have to tell me how much be your projected capital to start-up the business .
 business idea i 've be think of set up a business that provide a service for expatriate ; but not sure what sort of service be in short supply.does anyone have a suggestion ?
 vbprogrammer i have to decide on a service or a product before conduct a feasibility study . as for the capital ; i have 2 option . 100 ; 000 that i can invest anywhere ( the problem be that it 's too small ) ; the other option be 1 million but this amount belong to a company that be under establishment for educational service . so in this case any project must be in the educational sector . ( to which we already have a business plan ; but it 's pending a we originally project a capital of 5 million not only 1 ) . perhaps you 'll suggest that we switch to another non-educational project . that might be plan b if we could n't attract more investor . wizz14 : i 'm both an investor and look for investors/partners .

 never tell conartists ( housing agent ) your budget for a villa ! they will show you something worth 10 ; 000 qar and tell you it 's worth 15 ; 000 ! check online for aparthotels which rent out apartment on weekly / monthly basis . and another thing - it be illegal for agent to charge you sometimes as much a a month ' comission for show you villas . they get their commission from the landlord but many still try and 'con ' the prospective tenant . just a bit of advise - good luck !

 u ill have to oder key through ur car agency by courrier they can do it immediately ; it happen to me once i have audi s6 and i lose key in the gas ... ... .and i have to leave my car park at corniche for 8 day . cheer .
 there be a key shop next to the doha bank opp mecurre ( sofitel ) hotel down town ; you could try him ; he do some electronic key not all
 there be a bunch of keysmiths along sofitel street ( if you be come from souq najada ) . they charge me 200 riyal for the key . you can bargain some more to avail less price .
 car key with a chip ? can i get a second one make ? hi all i 've a nissan pathfinder and i need a second key make ; but the regular key shop can only make key that unlock the door but not start the car . the nissan dealer charge around qr 300 to make a second key . is there any other place where i can get a second key make for less that can be use to start the vehicle ? thanks a lot for look and answer .
 after i get the duplicate key from the agency it be still to be shape in a key shop . i go to a shop in industrial area petrol station ( street number 2 ) opposite mercedes . i be tell by the person there that he have the same machones like the agency and i would have save if i come to him first ; ; ; try there .
 your key be purposely make to have a code for security reason . it would be good to have it order to a nissan dealer ; and not somewhere else . but if you dont mind have ur key code know by others ; you can get a cheap service somewhere else .
 dealer only .
 bro ; try industrial area street no 1 call salam keys ( by the petrol pump besides mannai ) . they make computerised key ; they can make a key which will start the engine . cheers ;

 al khor to dukhan road anyone who travel from al khor to dukhan or vice versa ? what 's condition of the road like ? is it a busy road ? and i be wonder how safe it would be like to be travel alone ; esp . for a female driver . appreciate any response .
 it will take u like 2 hour . u have to take the north road or the one to golf club first ; then drive doha to dukhan . depends on the hour you may will get some traffic . are you plan to do this every day or just one weekend ? ? ? if it everyday move from al khor . there be no problem for female driver ; i believe you drive good than any of those bus driver or pick up driver ... the venezuelan sensation ! ! !
 its a very long drive ... whew ! thinking of it make me feel lazy and sleepy ! the road go to dukhan be under construction so you should be extra cautious on drive specially at night.becoz there be some area w/o light . it be safe for everyone ; but like i say just be careful . and yeah i also suggest that if you 'll do this everyday ; might as well move in to dukhan or at least doha ... you be talk about approximately 150-160kms km drive in one way alone ! < a target= ''  '' href= '' http : //www.blingcheese.com/ '' > < img src= '' http : //i153.photobucket.com/albums/s235/revmyspace2/graphics/brand/cars/cars '' title= '' myspace comments '' border= '' 0 '' > < /a > < br > < a target= ''  '' href= '' http : //www.blingcheese.com/ '' > mysp
 i be travel to dukhan and back to doha on a daily basis and i do n't find any problem with that . in fact the road be much more convenient now that they have finish most of the road work . but i 'd like to know the road condition from al khor to dukhan and back to al khor . i understand that it would take almost the same time like doha-dukhan ... thanks
 those who say it take 2 hr to get to dukhan from doha be wrong . however ; the drive itself be bore . it be safe even on the previous service road but now that most of the road work be near completion ; drive there should be fun . i myself would go to dukhan very soon before chill winter begin ... lol ******************************************* freedom be the right of all sentient being
 what be there in dukan any fun thing ot watch during weekend tirp for those who have not be there ?
 all of the above be talk about al khor to dukhan via doha but i remember there be a direct route to dukhan from al khor through jamaliya which be short and around 45 minute drive . ban spoon feeding not me
 joan you get on north road dont drive towards doha drive towards north about 15km you will notice a petrol pump and police station on your left side there be a turn to zubara before the police station . get on that road to zubara keep driving till you see another leave turn ghawriya it a on that road keep driving till you reach the dead end thats in jamiliya take right go straitght for 2 minute another dead end take leave turn there and drive for 25min it a free road with no heavy traffic on it you will land on dukhan road you take right turn and dukhan be just 10mins away from you . that all drive will take you around 70-80min . if you go via doha will take you long 2 hour for sure . < img src= '' http : //images.cooltext.com/155194.gif '' >

 mega mart behind the ramada be sell dual sim card phone from china . they be good but little expensive . the same phone be cheap in dubai . i have be use one for 8 month with no problem . price be approx 600aed with tv 660aed
 hey guys ; thanks for the answer . just a couple of question ; 1 . the samsung & the chinese phone - do they have `` real '' dual sim capability . ie . can you use both sim card simultaneously or do you have to switch between the 2 network allow you to operate only on 1 sim at a time 2.do the chinese phone come with warranty ? be it easy to replace part /gt it service etc .. thanks again guy cheers
 china dual sim phones : no warranty be provide for any china phones ; no spare part see yet except for battery ; charger and cable ; with proper care ; they can last a good time ; most china dual sims be with tv ; radio ; cam ; etc . ; if you be on a budget ; this fones will do
 dual sim mobile phone in qatar hi ; can someone tell me which be the available phone model which have dual sim facility ; and how i could get my hand on one of those ... got a vodafone sim - need to use it with the ol ' qtel sim ; in one phone . cheers
 i will speak for the samsung shg d880 . the following be from it user manual guide : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- sim card switch your phone support the dual sim card mode ; enable you to use two sim card at the same time without change them . activate sim card and select the primary sim card . 1 . in the idle mode ; press the swithching button at the left side of the phone . 2 . scroll to the sim card you want to use and select enable or primary . 3 . press { options } and select save . if you change the primary sim card ; the phone automatically turn off and back on . ** you can use browser ; e-mail ; multimedia message ; and stk applications service only with the primary sim card . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- as far a i 'm concerned with my phone ; it do n't need restart since the sim from my country be only use to receive sms message and not for call . that work for me just fine . you can always go to the store bring with you one qtel and one vodafone sim card and you can try it for yourself before you decide to buy .
 the best behavior be mind your own business .

 panadol be consider safe during pregnancy . vitamin c wo n't do anything for a cold ; so it 's best not to take when you might not know what else be in it .
 just consult with doctor .
 panadol yes ... vit c ... yes . but ; it be always recommend to consult a doc or at least the pharmacist .
 think she should take paracetamol not panadol-check
 panadol=paracetamol=acetaminophen . good quality vitamin c be ok ; too .
 generally all kind of medications take during pregnancy should be consult with the doctor ; this do not mean that you can not take any medication.. pandol be genrally safe and well a vit c
 yes it be safe to take panadol and vitamin c during pregnancy . but if you be already take prenatal vitamin then skip vitamin c..
 i think this should be a question for a doctor ; not for people you do n't know on a forum !
 what be his job & position he receive this offer then we can comment . but still you ask about the family living in qatar i will tell you some fact . as per the present rule your salary should be more than 7000 qr . then only you can apply for family visa . if you want to hire a single bedroom appartment in qatar you have to pay minimum 5000 qr . living expense for a bachelor will be minimum 700/800 qr . per month ( i think ) ; then family you can imagine . qatar be very expensive . before go to accept any offer from here please re-think twice . is that suitable for you ? or consult with any friend or relative live in qatar . all the best .
 how be the salary range for a good life in qatar my husband get an offer from a qatar construction company with a salary of 2500 qar + accomodation . please let me know it be a good offer or not . also ; be the family status possible with this salary and what be the minimum salary for family status ?
 family not possible.\ accept or reject offer a per ur financial condition and job designation . for labour salary be around 800 qr along accomodation . average salary for sacretary be around 4000 qr . therefore ; think and decide a per ur condition . normal skilled person can get easily more then 7000 qr .
 well i totally agree wid valentine
 no ; teachers over here be take purely on cv and interview . there be no police check do in most case . most school say they do check but a qatar have no juridisction ; how can they ? as i say ; they do n't do check and neither do they check qualification ( that 's in certain school ) . anybody that can prove otherwise ; feel free .
 well that 's certainly not true at the universities . all degree be check and a cpmplete background and security check be do ( not just a police certificate . ) it be very thorough and should be . mandi
 this be actually massively worry that they be not do background/police check ! ! i mean ... it really worrying ; not know what sort of person be teach your child . i mean you see it often in the uk ; teacher who have be arrest on child pornography charge ; and this be with the police checking ! !
 my partner do comment on how 'trusting ' the nursery appear compare to the uk where a newly employ person cant be leave with kid without be supervise by exist staff for several month . best thing to do be ask the place what they do and visit it to get a feel .

 mozaic tv hi ql friend now iam use usb internet modem since i use iam get 5gb for month but now i want to buy mozaic tv which qtel give land phone ; tv ; also internet with 1mb speed ; can any one suggest me how be the mozaic tv it internet connection be work good with 1mb speed pls reply me . cheer .
 the internet connection which come with mozaic tv be fairly good and relatively continuous . the speed vary all the time depend upon the use of internet of the other customer . anyway ; it be the best you can get for this amount . the quality of tv program be bad than what you can have with a simple digital receiver ( cost about 120 qr and 0 qr per month ) . furthermore ; the number of channel provide by mozaic ( without any extra package include ) be very restricted ; compair to above mention receiver .
 roadkill ; on the main road to saudi
 mozaic tv+ be awazing a it will cost u low and also for 1st 2 month it fantastic after tht u will only get ur basic package and in this package u wil not find many gud channel ... the reason i hav mozaic because of sport u will have to subscribe to sport package for cricket or football for qr 30 per month to get all time live sport n thts quite cheap ... with other recievers have to buy card n use it and it headache ... mozaic be gud with internet ... .i recommend you to go for it thanks
 yes.. mozaic tv be good . but internet connection be 10 % slow than only adsl connection without mozaictv . but for picture quality ; for me it be good . as clear a below picture . < img src= '' http : //sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs130.snc1/5600 '' alt= '' kampung sampireun garut indonesia '' width= '' 400 '' height= '' 250 '' / > < img src= '' http : //sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc1/hs130.snc1/5600 '' alt= '' kampung sampireun garut indonesia '' width= '' 400 '' height= '' 250 '' / > < img src= '' http : //sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs635.snc3/31871 '' alt= '' kampung sampireun garut indonesia '' width= '' 300 '' height= '' 400 '' / > < img src= '' http : //sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash1/hs483.ash1/26455 '' alt= '' kampung sampireun garut indonesia '' width= '' 400 '' height= '' 250 '' / > < img src= '' http : //sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs483.snc3/26455 '' alt= '' kampung sampireun garut indonesia '' width= '' 400 '' height= '' 250 '' / > < img src= '' http : //www.itravelindonesia.com/hotel/java/images/bromo-semeru-low-clouds.jpg '' alt= '' kampung sampireun garut indonesia '' width= '' 400 '' height= '' 250 '' / >
 mozaic tv+ be a good option.it be cheap and the internet speed be also good.also all the channel be free for 02 month apart from your package.i be use aisan package and it be a good option here in qatar .

 whatever you buy you should be able to print out . or have them send fedex . mandi
 hey ; my suggestion would be to buy the euro rail pas from there itself ! yes ; i do it when i be go from berlin to amsterdam ; i take a 3-way euro-rail pas ; and get 5 cross-country travel . and it just take 5 minute at the ticket counter ; tell them your plan ; and they assist you better.. regarding bus ; you can get a travel card seperately for these 3 country from the bus itself i think ; or near to or in the train station ; they have a ticket booth i guess hope that helps..good luck and bon bon voyage !
 google it you 'll get all the information . you cant get it from doha you can purchase online .
 thanks every body for your help and your interest
 my friend ; without basic training you can not directly go for a driving test . only us and european license holder can directly apply for a test . indian or even a m.e license be not consider for direct test . the basic course will cost you near about qr 600/- good luck
 technically ; yes you can ! but i would advice you to take even a short refresher `` practice '' of the actual test so you 'll be familiar with the venue and manner of test driving !
 i have get a valid indian license ; can i apply for the test directly without go thro any driving school ; if so wats the fee and procedure for the test..
 technically yes you can have 2 atempts for a direct test but you will never be able to clear ; i sugest to take short cource before you give test ; it will clear you in one shot . all the best
 you be right ... in this case ; noc be must .
 that if you have no noc then you need to wait 2 year before you be eligible to get a new job in qatar . expect amazing !
 ouch ! so there 's no other way ? : ( even if my contract be finish ? : (
 that 's a sad truth.. qatar be a nice place to work at . : ( . be there an article before in a newspaper that company be to give their employee nocs ? or be they pertain to select company only ?
 is it something that be include in koran ; or be it a cultural value ?
 if that one be really a muslim country ; then none .
 none ! both be against sharia law .
 there be always a reason why thing be forbid in sharia law and it for the good of whole mankind .

 same sex marriage acceptable ? if a muslim country be to be give a choice between allow everyone to get married ( include same sex marriage ) or allow people to live together without get marry ... . which one would they choose ? why ?
 baughjk ; what do i say wrong ? ? i do n't think so ... this be what my knowledge be concern for muslim country..and plz dont point my name here..there r many who have give same replies..thnx ...
 soniya - say 'stop think ' really be a sad thing to say ... baughajk - i can see the point in what you say that same sex marriage would stop 'the life cycle ' ; but i disagree that the same applies to non-married couple . but on a serious note - i will pm you so you can explain the reason . thank you
 baughk ; what wrong do i say ? ? i do n't think so..look at the other 's reply a well..kindly do n't point out my name espeically..thnx..

 they say when you install ie8 ; you wont be have problem with key port especially if you use windows live messenger . better yet ; switch to firefox . good luck
 ( dumb question ) how do i switch to firefox ? mandi

 johnpur ; where be your ponytail ? ? and i think be not either race or religion ... it be money .
 a country would have a pact with the devil for their own interest and benefit . it would n't matter if the devil be african ; asian or simply a zionist . salam
 md - call for you and your bold letter .  - listen to many ... speak to a few -
 they 're not consider really white .
 well donosa ; time to upgrade myself
 race or religion would israel have enjoy the same support from usa in particular and eu in general a it do now ; if ; israelis be not predomuinantly ; white population ? the same question viz a viz palestinian and arab support .
 @ hapy ; i second what qatariladysaid ; they 're consider middle-eastern ( brown ) ; not white mate ... the support they enjoy be because the jews control wall street & have a significant presence in the eu financial market a well & money talk right ? ! ... also a good number of non-israeli jewish people around the world support israel financially & otherwise so hopefully this answer your question ...
 have you ever actually meet a jew ? ? ? most of them be n't white ; they look arab .
 if not in real life ; we see them on tv . in fact i have a jewish friend whom i appreciate along with his family . salam
 it can not be just money ; money might be a major factor when it come for foreign policy of government but we also see that european and american people esp white be sympathetic to israeli cause . according to this wikipedia article nearly 80 % jew of israel come from european regions.http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics
 i have see them on tv and they look white like lippi tivini and netenyaho
 some be white ; and then not really european white . they have a unique look . if we be sympathetic to them it 's because we be deal with about a 1000 year worth of guilt for how they be treat .
 a jew be not black or white.. he may be a kike ; a yid ; a heebie ; a hook-nose ; kosher or a red sea pedestrian ; but not white ...
 gypsy ; thats a very smart way of deal with the guilt . and what do you mean that they look like arab ? if you mean look like light skin arab of syrian ; palestinian type ; or brown skin like native of saudi arabia ; yemen ; emirates etc .
 late ; but not too late : boycott religious threads ! !
 i 'm not boycott thread ; i 'm selective ; you can do the same . salam
 race or religion would israel have enjoy the same support from usa in particular and eu in general a it do now ; if ; israelis be not predomuinantly ; white population ? the same question viz a viz palestinian and arab support .
 hows this a religious thread ?
 color mean religion on ql ; race mean religion on ql ; your favorite movie mean religion on ql ; what 's for lunch mean religion on ql and religion lead to something absolutely irreligious on ql . salam
 you 're right.. what i find strange be that with a whole wide world out there ; so many non religious people can focus on religion so much : )
 if someone mention on the lunch thread they 're go to eat bacon with egg tonight ; hell will descend on earth ; i know what you mean . salam
 beef bacon be the most disgusting thing ever create .
 we will know if it 's beef or pork bacon ; when the qler tell u what kind of wine they 're have with the meal ... : ) ) i do n't know ; but generally muslims do n't like to use the word bacon or mortadella . although hotel serve muslim meal use these term . salam
 thread hijack alert ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! get back to the topic.. i be sure that the red sea pedestrian would enjoy the same support ; because of their `` influence '' in politics ; industry and medium .
 if it 's about race the whole world will be impartial because we 're cousin . it have more to do with fear maybe not mutual interest . remember jfk ; clinton and what's-her-name ?
 it be mutual .. i do n't want to piss them off because they can hurt me in many ways.. so both our interest be serve : )
 it 's mutual if no party feel under pressure to accept thing they would normaly reject .
 race or religion would israel have enjoy the same support from usa in particular and eu in general a it do now ; if ; israelis be not predomuinantly ; white population ? the same question viz a viz palestinian and arab support .
 so ; go to visit the mother in law be class a mutually beneficial ? ?
 yep.. to practise patience and self-control : )
 you 're please your wife and so do your mother in law ... : ) ) your wife be the super power here . this be a win-win visit for your own interest too.. : ) we 're off topic again ! salam
 naturally the whole world who be christianity by faith will give support to israel for the very reason of their origin of faith . its not only the super power like the us and eu who be see on the front line of support but the little little voice scatter through out asia and the north americas . literally ; if the muslim pray towards the makkah ; the christian would pray towards jerusalem .
 the question be all wrong ... it have little to do with black or white ; it have to do with religious people declare land holy and thus protect from distance their holy site .
 use a travel agent ... they will handle it for you .
 that way we have 'dozens ' with local nationality ... .

 second hm 's reply ; just make sure u get a re entry permit before u travel
 what `` visit '' visa be you on ? is it a tourist visit visa through the hotel ? is the a visit visa upon arrival ? is it a business visit visa ? is it a family visit visa ? all visa in qatar be visit type ; include work visa . we be all visitors here ; mean no citizenship shall be grant . but type of visit visa can be different . so let u start from it .

 do they have visa like `` get in touch visa ''
 anyone know any travel agency who provide ticket back and forth for re-entry ?
 just want to know if it be okay not to finish family visit visa until july 22 . my husband need to go back to phil . for some reason . will it matter if we be plan to apply another visa by jan. 2012 ?
 yep ; you can come back on the same visit visa ; if you be on family visit visa ... . just get a form type by the typist ; go to booth no 4 at main immigration ; pay 200 qar and you will get a re entry visa ...

 it purely depend upon your relationship . buy some sweet and try to meet her after office hour if possible . as you both chickas so i guess meeting outside be not so tough . and show her you offer and discuss your future plan with her like you will get marry ; you have problem in your family ; you need to be more financially secure to help them etc . i do the same to leave my previous employer . my boss be so impressed that he give me noc and he give me his own money too . of course i dont wanted money from his pocket but my story be so emotional . i guess you get the point .
 hi approach the legal authority and present this case to them . show your bank account detail to prove that you dont have job and be not pay for 1 or two month etc . be submissive to your bos and it your need to get this offer . convince her on your situation and inability to continue here even if the job be on a your bos say . i do belive that once she be convince that you have no other way and will leave her ; she will agree for it . her main issue may be that if you leave with noc others will also come in line for that . manoj
 take her out for a drink and speak your soul out to her ; i be sure she be go to say a yes and remain your friend forever and never a bos
 mr. manoj ; there ca n't b harm if i approach for legal action ... i mean they can cancel me . plz tell me how to n to whom i have to approach

( 2nd option ) but try your best to get release from her in proper way.. convince her . count a million problem . or else demand a big salary . and in mean while try for another country.. may be you get good chance out side qatar.. life be not only in qatar..

 hai 2 year be too early to start formal learning..at the same time no need to neglect learn session completely ... .you can use building block to make her familiar with the concept of number ... spend quality time with the kid and thus she learn name of object with out be burden ... read lot of story so that she become familar with book and her imagination work and book automatically become her friend when she grow up ... .formal learning can wait till she be 3 ... .enjoy your time with her because kid grow up fast ...
 kid be learn all the time ; talk to your child all the time . talk and read fun book with your child will give them a good start . baby einstein video be great you can watch some of the dvd on youtube link http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=iqy71epi14q & feature=related you can also view lot of learnig material on abc 's ; learning colour ; nursery rythmes etc on youtube . link : http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ltfxyvnixws bear in mind while these video be good for kid to watch and learn ; dont replace them with reading ; draw with crayon ; puzzle ; block etc . also be invloved and play with your child ; they will learn whilst they be have fun with you .

 im glad i meet the wall ! ! !
 i be apprehensive to try the wall real estate but through the testimony of my co worker who be with the wall ; i be encourage and never do i thought that it be a fantastic decision i have make . there be this one time that i have to call them because the exhaust fan of my kitchen do not work properly ; guess what ; before the day end ; they fix it .

 the fresh tilapia fish sell here in qatar be mostly come from egypt while the frozen one be from southeast asia or india .
 the best and it really work ! ! be at carrefour be call spring ' anty bladluis ' be a green can . be for garden but be the only one to kill my bed bug and be cheap ! and safe for beds.= ) please try it . be in the gardening section
 the best thing to kill bed bug be actually free - uv light ! take your mattress outside for a few hour . do n't forget to turn it regularly .
 they be the bad creatures/bugs on planet earth . its so difficult to exterminate them . what ever pesticide you will use most probably they will show up again . what ever the pesticide . the only thing i believe can work be that take all your wooden furniture out in hot sunny day include your bed and leave it there for couple of hour . killing them by burn them be the only good solution . pesticide can work but you will never get 100 % result . i once saw a documentary on national geographic and i be tell you it really hard to get rid of them . if you think they be come from the next room then my recommendation to move out . if i have to pay 10k for one room i will instead live in a room which be free but full of bug . good luck exterminate bug . peace .
 you can try carrefour saw some thing there . but like balderick2dogs suggest uv light be best will get rid of most of these bugs..
 where can i buy good and effective bed bug eliminator spray here ? i be so upset about little creature ; they keep on come back even if i keep my room clean . but my suspect be this other room which be i think a factory of bed bug . i want to eliminate these creature before any serious infection happen . but i do n't know where can i find the pest pesticide for this problem ; please guide me ... .
 hi friend ; those nasty bed bug be not only live on the bed . they live on the curtain ; furniture and even under carpet . if you leave them untouched for some time they will increase in number . uv light be good for kill them from your bed but you can not take everything to sun light . it will be good if you treat all the material in your room at the same time . take your bed to the balcony or terrace and leave it there for two three day in the hot sun light turn it upside down very often . you may use the pesticide ( the one from carrefour ) in your room for one or two day . spray well and keep the room close . you should use it vigorously . this will kill the bed bug in your room as well a on your bed . make sure that your friend in the other room should also do it at the same time otherwise you will not be able to clear them .
 uv light !
 buy `` good bye bed bug '' spry from al-meera . this be a product of `` good bye '' company . i do n't know this available in qatar ; but available in uae .

 from different sponsor ... .so no problem ... .
 bepsi thats amaze . good luck troll
 i know of a family whose family visa be reject on the ground that the marriage certificate ( attest by the embassy ) be not valid/legal . the wife be muslim and the husband christian . since you have be offer job by different sponsor visa might not be the problem . but i assume you will be live together so please look into the fact that your marriage will be consider legal/not .
 muslim wife and non-muslim husband ? hi everybody . my wife and i both get offer ( from different sponsor ) to work in qatar . now ; my wife be a muslim ( her father be a muslim ) and i be not . we make a civil marriage ( not in the church ) in our country . is this go to make any problem for u with get a visa and working in qatar ? thank you all for your answer .
 there be no problem in get visa because you 'll be work w/ different sponsor . you will only face problem when caught live together and/or if you change your wife 's sponsorship under you . because islamically you be not legally marry and qatar be an islamic country .
 but would the employer ( if housing be provide ) know that he be not muslim ( whether housing be provide by either employer ) ?
 mega troll alert . bepsy give you away ...
 i do n't think your marriage will be consider valid here . there be a story some time back about a couple who be deport after some public display of affection issue on the cornish . when the case go to court turn out that their marriage be consider invalid and they both end up be deport .
 troll
 my hubby be a convert and he have to have legal document attest his conversion ; along with our marriage certificate ; a he have n't change his name legally . thus he have to prove he be a muslim when apply for family status . so the sponsor will find out the op 's not a muslim unless he have document to prove he be a convert .
 muslim
 okay ; so i guess get a work visa for u would not be a problem since there be two different sponsor . but the fact that we would be do something illegal concern me . we would most definitely be live together and that should be consider illegal because of our muslim-christian marriage . and on top of that ; we could not get a housing from sponsor because our marriage be consider faulty .
 sorry ; misunderstood op post
 it would not be a problem since your state make your union legal ... .. it wont be an issue then ... ... . advise me if be wrong ... ..

 thank you all . you have give me more than enough information with your question . this be go to be a difficult decision ; since i do n't consider convert to islam a an easy option . pretending to be something you be not and live like that every day be not something one should accept easily . p.s . i do n't understand why some of your think i be a trolling ? : )
 bepsy be a word use only in ql how come a new user know this word ... .. you be a troll
 how be bepsy use in ql ? this be my standard nickname in many forum . i do n't understand why username bepsy make me a troll ; but never mind ...
 if i may ask ; does your civil marriage certificate mention the religious background of your wife ? if not ; i say attest it at the near qatari embassy and you be safe to go ; if your wife have a typical muslim name so do obama `` hussain '' .
 hello bepsy.. well to refuce the offer witch u get ... ... ..ther be fight start before u come ... .i cant imagine what will be happen after u come ... ... ... ... we dont want make trouble for ql member ... ... ... ... .
 tak jsi z chorvatska ?
 ok ; bepsy !
 thank you dracula ; glad you like my photo . thank you .
 muslim wife and non-muslim husband ? hi everybody . my wife and i both get offer ( from different sponsor ) to work in qatar . now ; my wife be a muslim ( her father be a muslim ) and i be not . we make a civil marriage ( not in the church ) in our country . is this go to make any problem for u with get a visa and working in qatar ? thank you all for your answer .
 saeed khan alwayssssss greate ... ... ... ..he have answer whatever the question ... ... ... ... ..we must respect him ... ..i realy love u saeed khan ... .
 what about live together ? you do n't have any issue with that ? since it be consider illegal .
 it not consider illegal as long a u have a marriage certificate attest from the embassy of the respective country . they didnt even ask u abt our religion !
 i never hear any religion say that if you love someone ; and because of you be just divided by faith ; love him/her will give you one way ticket to hell . religion usually refers and teach fairness ; respect ; truth ; humility . so no discrimination of faith in marry as per a i know . i have several friend marry muslim to a non-muslim ; either way but the teaching of goodness manifest on how they apply towards other people and work ; and not towards on what they be believe religion . anyway ; opinion be a really opinion ... there be no right nor wrong . and we can not further discus if the basis be holy quoran and holy bible . we can not justify argument from different basis . they have both their own strong point ; deal with it . if the marriage document be attest by the both consul ; then i think there be no problem and big deal at all . this be just a discussion forum ; do n't use this a your actual reference . the best thing be to inquire your case to qatar government agency directly ; you be not the only one who have this kind of problem anyway ; i 'm very sure there be always fair ruling that you can get from them . good luck !
 `` anyway ; opinion be a really opinion ... there be no right nor wrong . '' but the marriage in islam be not a matter for anyone to give an opinion over ... it 's a fixed law . it 's forbidden ... so it 's wrong.. any `` true '' muslim would n't even dare to cross that line ... but i assure you whoever do it.. they 're muslim by name.. and i do n't think they care to pray or fast ... if they fear god.. they would n't have do it ...
 very well say !
 never think about it ; maintinance cost be very high and the resell value be very low .
 ask previous volvo owner . if you ask the vast majority of qatar living member that will drive nothing but japanese car then you wo n't get an honest answer . also please do remember that you be buy a prestige brand so the cost of maintain that will be more than a cheap ; volume brand . when it come to customer service at volvo service centre ; please just try them once . they be professional ; courteous and most of all honest . if you would like any information or history on the car you be buy please do not hesitate to contact me on 6022476 . i work for domasco volvo and we do value all of our customers !
 i 've be use volvos for about 5 year now both in qatar and in the uk and they have prove to be very reliable car . the cost of maintenance be slightly high than most but then you be get what you pay for . regarding the comment about car fall apart after 5 year ; i think that person be talk about american car .
 i agree with joe90 . the s80 a great car . here in north america both volvo and honda be consider great car ( and toyota ) that offer great value and great service from dealer . it 's disappointing to hear the dealer of these car n qatar do n't hold up their end of the bargain . you 'd hardly need to worry about a volvo break down . when it do ; yes ; part be a bit more expensive than japanese car but nowhere near the level of mercedes or bmw . it 's comfortable and safe ; huge trunk ; sporty feel . you could feel the heavy weight of the car when you first start drive it ; which be why it use as much gas a it do . i love mine but sadly have to sell it soon when i move to doha . so ; that 's why relatively ; i see less hondas on sale on this site than toyotas . the dealership . i be wonder why i do n't see the honda ridgeline and pilot list anywhere ; nor the toyota sienna . honda 's mystery solve .
 qn for all moms - frequent fever my kid be fall sick frequently for the past 3 months.whwnever i go to the doctor i receive the same answer `` viral fever '' and nothing to worry about . is it common for the kid here or should i get her diagnoised ( take her back home ) completely . btw ; my kid be 3 year old .
 its better to do a chest x-ray ... .ask the doctor to test for pneumonia ... the doctor here dont really diagnose it at the initial stage ... but it will be bad later . repeat fever be one of the symptom ... . < a href= '' http : //photobucket.com/images/funny '' target= ''  '' > < img src= '' http : //i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg12/n-a-t-a-s-j-a/funny/smile.gif '' border= '' 0 '' alt= '' smile pictures ; images and photos '' / > < /a >
 the new name give by my family to this vi be school syndrome ; you shall notice that this occur frequently when the school open and continue . this ss go away or stabilize when the school go for long break ( fortnight or more ) . the issue be that we go to the doctor when the symptom be acquire and he work with you to remove or stable it . the area where no body work on be the prevention ; both the parent and the school management or even the health authority . it be all leave on herd immunity but do not affect much . the parent should teach the kid basic hygienic plus give them fresh clothes every day and make them take shower every time they land in and also give them the natural preventive gift ( detail can be provide on direct im/pm ) the school should have good distance between each pupil ( seat arrangement ) and good ventilation arrangement in the class and or playground ( if internal ) and further monitor that no kid with flue or infection should attend the class . furthermore the transport should be much clean and well ventilate . the school should also have record of the pupil who have pet at home specially the caged/feathered pet ; to be sure of the possible source should some viral infection arise from the pet ; . the health authority should be the observer for both of the above action on frequent basis . this can get really worry if with this frequent hit of viral infection and follow on use of antibiotics ; the child will get immune to the ab and then one have to use steroid which be not good at all . this out of my experience should bring the so called 'school syndrome ' to the least ... . hope this help you a well . take care
 my kid be in a daycare for the past 2 and a half months.she felt sick very frequently when she be in daycare . but now she be at home with my maid.she be fine for last 15 days.but get fever again yesterday ( doctor say `` viral '' again ) .i be just worry if it cud be something serious .
 abusaif ; will keep it in mind . fs ; the doctor say no need of xray or blood test.he say there be no sign of pneumonia a well.i be just totally confused and to be frank frustrate . as a mom i be not able to see her take medicine frequently and in 3 month she have be give 3 antibiotics.and one start again yesterday..
 i be not a heatlh care provider ; but i recommend you change the doctor . if it be a viral infection ; there will be no need for antibiotic . why be he/she give her antibiotic ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? and 3 antibiotic in 3 month ? ? ? ? oh come on ! and why not a blood test ? ? ? ? go to another doctor..
 get another doctor 's opinion.. just to be sure ; have your child undergo a general physical as well a complete blood workup even x-ray.. no harm in do that ; this be your child 's health at stake.. < a target= ''  '' href= '' http : //www.blingcheese.com/ '' > < img src= '' http : //i153.photobucket.com/albums/s235/revmyspace2/graphics/misc/smileys/smiley '' title= '' myspace comments '' border= '' 0 '' > < /a > < br > < a target= ''  '' href= '' http : //www.blingchees

 hi einstind there be no such a thing a viral fever ; because 1.if it viral there be no fever in the body . 2 . if there be fever it mean there be infection somewhere and the natural body defense be try to fight it by increase the body temp . the fact she be in daycare that mean expose to many new thing to her system teach her always to wash her hand . 3 year old be very smart and can remember rule : ) this be what i personally do when my kid doesnt feel well : 1 . no medication ( no antibiotic ) 2 . keep check the temp . every 1/2 hr . 2 . take him to my chiropractor for spinal adjustment ( dr. cyrus be our chiropractor here in doha ) that will help the child 's natural immunity system . 3 . chicken soup with lot of onion and garlic . 4 . no sweet or fry food . 5 . let her eat plain yogurt it help to reduce the inner body temp . 6 . light clothes and keep wash her foot with cold water . hope this will help
 thanks a lot for the information.could you please let me know what do a chirpractor do ? i mean his role ... anyway will google it also..

 qn for all moms - frequent fever my kid be fall sick frequently for the past 3 months.whwnever i go to the doctor i receive the same answer `` viral fever '' and nothing to worry about . is it common for the kid here or should i get her diagnoised ( take her back home ) completely . btw ; my kid be 3 year old .
 my daughter 's doctor be dr attiya at al ahli ; we have also see dr samer there as well . he be very good too . they might be a little on the expensive side ; but very worth it as far a your child 's health go . motherhood ... the hard job you 'll ever love ! : )
 einstind ; i have the same problem with my daugter when she be in the daycare but since your child be at home try start with shampoo your sofa set and carpet and keep your house dust free . al rafa there be good doctor for child dr.basha or try dr. shaboon at doha clinic
 we go to pec or to dr badsha of al-rafa..
 nqatar ; was ur daughter prescribe freq antibiotic ?
 if it be me ; i would take the kid home . ca n't trust the medical profession here ! ! ! period . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- quidquid latine dictum sit ; altum sonatur .
 since we be here ; my 3 year old daughter be always sick ; she be never sick before ; always have high fever ; cough ; her doctor use to say it an allergy he be just change the medecins and give her antibiotic ; so i decide to take her to another doctor when t tell him what happend he decide to do a chest x ray and he find out that my daughter have atypical pneumonia ! ! ! so you have nothing to loose by do a chest x ray ... .by the way she get it from the nursery ... .good luck .
 also if it be a virus ; they be not suppose to give you anything for it . you be suppose to let it run it 's course . no antibiotic . i hate it when my daughter be sick ... i feel so helpless . i hope your little one feel good soon . be strong . motherhood ... the hard job you 'll ever love ! : )
 by god 's grace she be okay now.hoping that she will not fall sick again.but this be what i be go to do the next time she fall sick.i be go to insist the doctor for an x-ray and a blood work-up.bcoz she be have block nose very frequently ( not run nose ) .i suspect there be something beyond this normal cold and fever thing .
 get a humidifier or take her in the bathroom with you and run the shower on hot so it create a lot of steam . that will help clear her nose . another thing i use be vicks baby vaporub . it have menthol and eucalyptus ; and it open their little nose pretty quick . i worry about the medical care standard here ; but so far dr 's attiya and samer at al ahli have do a great job for my daughter and we have be here almost 2 year . good luck ; hope the little one stay well ! : ) motherhood ... the hard job you 'll ever love ! : )
 oh block nose be very common in child this age ! ! there be a medical reason for this but i 'm not sure enough what it be to post ... ... . do n't put your child through the stress of blood and xrays for nothing ... it extremely traumatic for them !

 einstind ; you 're welcome ... ..hope she 's good now ... ..theres alot to be say for sleep in child this age ; thats why it bother me when i see young child up at ridiculous o'clock ; they need sleep and rest to boost their immune system . when they do n't get enough they fall ill with all and sundry ! ...

 and what purpose do it serve ?
 it 's the only way . if you choose the cheap postage on amazon it get ' good still . aramex of course charge for the postage but there be an option on amazon to send all your order together . i do n't know if this work out cheap or not . i just order at will and when it come i pay the fee .
 there be plenty of thing to buy online that be a lot cheap than buy in qatar ; here be some of the thing that i have buy online : apple product - much cheap sunglasses - raybans ; much cheap mobile phone accessory asics gel trainers - much cheap books - much good selection and cheap . generally anything that i want to buy that be go to cost over qr500 ; i will check online to see how much i can get it for there . i get all the stuff send to my aramex account and then send to me here in doha .
 never have any online purchase ; but would like to get some feedback .
 in amazon if you choose product which be sell and ship by amazon you have the option of ship them a one package ; or if you get some product which be be sell by amazon but sell by some other seller then it will be ship from two place to your aramex account . aramex unfortunately do not have the possibility to consolidate all your package and ship a you want ; hope they start it soon coz of their price . but dhl easyshop do it . i have n't use them till now ; but if i do end up buy from different place then i would definitely use it .
 be it really cost effective to buy online ? i hope people share their experience in online shopping . which item be recommend for online shopping ? also please give some example of the total cost in both case ( online and in store ) thanks
 check the price online + tax + shipping rate then compare the item price sell in qatar . i buy dlsrs ; lens and camera accessory for me and my friend in amazon.com or adorama.com a it be much cheap there with shipping rate and tax include
 about 10 day normally - but you should consider use aramax 's ship and shop service next time
 in qatar ; it be not deliver . one have to go to post office to collect even letter . when bank send credit card to me via mail ; i get repeat call from post office to collect my mail from post office . at first i be very much surprise to hear that ; i get mail . it be in post office and i be ask to come during post office work hour to collect it ? then why it be call postal service ? wait for phone call from post office after eid holiday .

 if any accident your wife presence in need
 if my wife be not der with me i m the one who do the accident or violation so at the time of police check i can call my wife ok
 can any one tell me exact answer
 why ; do you make an accident already with your nissan sunny which you buy a few day ago ? if im not mistake you buy the car for qr 26 ; 000 ?
 no i havent do accident just ask dear
 no need of paper if you be do it on your own . by the way if you give your bus to some company for their use & ask them to pay you monthly rent ; it would save you all trouble : ) good luck .
 and they wo n't allow that . it 's illegal .
 i believe ; consciouseffort have be sarcastic.. : ) nadiaqatar ; you be member on ql for 1 year 46 weeks.. do n't you still know that you have to ask a permission for your every step in qatar.. and you ask such silly question : do you need paper to run your business ? that 's why you get such silly answer : no ; yallah ; no need nothing ; no paper ; no registration ; no 100 permit ... just buy your bus ; or plane or helicopter and do whatever you want..
 you need a permit to have a billiards table in your cafe and to sell sheesh shah ... .. so for a bus ... ... .
 a pick up service-project plan i be thinking of buy a mini bus and start a drop and pick up service for individual i be housewife ; ; do i need any official paper ? sponsor ? company name ? etc ?
 thanks for ur reply ; but i be serious
 buy a van and rent to any company
 how much the used van here i can find ? any idea plz
 i m serious . you just try to buy a new model van bus with ac . any company can easily take it in monthly rent base . try local market to buy one or try ql . it 's legal .
 put a classified ad in ql & let someone contact you ... . you 'll automatically know if paper work be require for just 1 bus/van or no
 the issue with this be not that it can not be do ; have you think about what will happen if your bus thats rent out to some company meet with an accident ? the cop will catch you for rent it out without paper work .
 qatarisun i will not drive the bus by myself of course all ok i understand i need a paper work ; can u tell me exactly what kind of paper work do i need and from where i can issue ? thanks
 you ca n't buy any commercial transpiration with out qatari name or company name . when you buy one then they have to give you all require paper you need for your need .
 hi all ; if you find a solution please pas it me also ... ;

 cid fingerprint and screening . i 've get a job in doha and my employer want me to go for cid fingerprint and screening . what be this cid mean and what be it for ? can anyone please explain .
 it 's a normal process as far a i 'm concerned . unless u 've get something to hide ? just be frank ; maybe some of u can help ... .good luck
 ok ; let me be frank . i 'm ban in abu dhabi . the question here be ; can i work in doha . i 'm aware that qatar be part of gcc like uae . please help me if you know anything about this .
 nothing to worry..its just a normal procedure for employment visa application . your ban in abu dhabi be jut for uae only ; so you dont have to worry about it here .
 you mean there be no information share within the gcc country ? if so ; can qatar deport me ? appreciate if there be more view on this .
 for now . they 're work on a unified gcc database .
 so will i have a problem once they unify gcc database ?
 absolutely naothing to wory about..unless u have do bad thing in uae ; .my advice be follow ur employer instruction ; and stop worrying .
 bad thing like criminal definitely no . just do n't clear my debt . thats it .
 if your debt be with x-employer ; no issue . if it 's with a bank and if you have good intention of clear it upon get a new/better employment - also no problem . ( banks investigation will ultimately reveal your presence in your current location and detail ; they can easily trace and chase you for settlement . be honest and avoid potential risk )
 thanks all . will still wait for more advise and suggestion .

 salam if you want change ur sponcer the only thing you can do be just canceld ur visa and be sure it 's cancled then go out and come back business visa you can do that only one year after that you can come to new visa
 first you need a noc letter ; no matter what ! second ; even though you work less than 1 year with the same company it should n't be a problem to transfer the sponsorship from one company to another ; ecpesially if your new company be strong enough . your nationality be the advantage in this case .
 problem i be work for a company since december 2008 ... can i change my job and my sponsor ? and if he cancel my visa can i go out side qatar and come back to another company ?
 if cancel ; a minimum of 2 year ban will be impose to you ; ban you to come back to doha . avoid cancel your visa and try to convince your sponsor and have a nice conversation to them . be patient and humble always .
 mr ammar..guys do n't mislead the person ; if you do n't kow what you be talk about . he can not just cancel an rp and come back under the business visa ... he wo n't be allow into the country with noc letter in the first place ! all he need be noc letter .
 all car manufacturer be sell good car . it depend on your need and your budget . last week my friend buy 2012 toyota furtuner ; and i drive it from industrial to his accommodation . toyota be good and high resale value .
 base on my observation and accord to my friend yes it be indeed an excellent 4x4 suv car . toyota have a good reputation ; have a high resale value and after sale service be guaranteed superb . i have 2008 model and so far until now it have a good condition inside/outisde and never i have heavy mechanical problem so far . thanks to god ... it also depend how u use ur car and it a must to bring it to the service center every 5000 km for a service maitenance . therefore i can highly recommend it to u. : )
 i would never go for a fortuner ... ! anyways ; toyota always have a good resale . it dosent very much affect where the car be assemble coz they be always make with company brand 's standardization & certification .
 toyota car be solid and the resale value be good . go for it .
 try fridays ... : )

 diplomatic club have a decent steak place . also hear that the golf club have a good steak restaurant ; but i have yet to try that one .
 what be the best steak resturant in qatar ? i be bore of make home steak and the only steak house i have see be the one in villagio . is there any other resturant where they serve good steak . has meat company open up in doha ? chillies ; benigans and applebees be not an option for good steak .
 apple bees ; t.g fridays and chillies all these three be the best in qatar
 lol bijoy ... that 's the right name ! : )
 friday 's steak be okay . for a change ; have you try chicken espetada at nando 's ; city center ? they be really good .
 butcher shop
 my fav . be deep-fried steak from chilli ... ... .
 thanx guy . fridays ; chilli ; pandarosa ; bennigans all taste the same to me ; not mouth water steak like meat company in dubai and bahrain and sizzlers restaurant in henry 's cafe bar really good . i miss that place already .
 bennigan 's in front of khalifa tennis complex . they can really make my steak medium well .
 but since chilli be not an option for you ... . try steak from four season ... ... . .
 try majless ; nr landmark ; a u go nr gas station on the corner ; food exerlent and cheap.do nice steak in sauce ; enjoy
 honestly ; i 've be search hard for the same thing . i have not try the south african place at villagio yet though i 've hear it good . but still ; i do n't think it dry age . i have have steak at the restaurant at the top of la cigale which be actually incredible . of course it be wagyu beef and cost about 350 qr but it be comparable to the best steak i 've have from place like peter lugers ; delfrisco 's ; etc .

 hello ! well pest do exist everywhere and qatar be no exception.the general standard of cleaniness be fairly good here and surely wont dissapoint.if you be goig to live in a compound then will be maintainance and cleaning a well.so no worry there .
 thanks that be slightly more comforting . i be horried to read about people have to lockdown toilet seat and gap in the window etc to keep them out so i wasnt sure if this be the general trend and something we should prepare ourselves for.i can imagine myself lose sleep over roach run on my bed or get stick in my hair eeekk ! i understand it be a warm country and a certain amount of tolerance require ; not so sure i can accomodate pest in the home though . will have to wait and see .
 if you have a villa such problem would be minimal to nil in my experience . in apartment ; often the case be no matter how clean you be - your neighbour standard may not be up to yours and the bug get in . again ; not a if you be live like an unhygenic family ; but the bug know no boundary .
 mel1 a a saffer myself ; i can guarantee you will see no more cockroach crawl around your house here ; than you would see back home : - ) qatar be parktown prawn free ; -p
 i be at the company apartment at the mo ... i find i have to wash the floor everyday ... because of the cockroach ... . my house be very clean but unfortunately it the maintenance of the building which be utter crap ... . and then some neighbour also certain not clean ... . i have be tell it pretty normal ..though the cleaner you be the good off course ... i cant wait to move to the villa a i will have a bit more control ... dont despair ... . though ... . i hateeeeee them so muchhhhh it the worse freak insect i can put with ... . in the uk we have the spider but heck i manage to get rid of the thing here just seem doesnt matter what i do ... you see them every now and then come from the outside ... ewwwww ... .. it get rarer and rarer but it doesnt make it any easy that we have construction site all around u ... . you will be fine ... : ) dont worry ... it worth leave london to come here ... . we be portuguese and southafrican who also live in the uk for many year : ) good luck and enjoy the move : )
 be creepy crawlies everywhere ? hi we be southafrican living in uk and soon to be move to qatar . my hubby get offer a teach job with villa accomodation provide . problem be i be completely irk out by creepy crawlies . i read on the forum about the roach and other pest in qatar accomodation . can anyone tell me if this problem be common in all accomodations ; even more expensive one and apartment ?
 just bring 10 big lizard from uk then if you get a three room villa just put each room with two lizard and 1 in the kitchen ; 1 in the sala and in the bathroom ...
 mel1 ! a warm welcome to qatar . to be 100 % sure you do n't confront these stupid bug ; i suggest you to ensure that your villa be newly construct ; ie you be go to be the first occupant . also ensure that it have be furnish with new furniture and not the refurbished or that be shift from somewhere where it be in use . if the furniture be new ; the chance of bed bug welcome you will be minimal . during your tenure here ; keep your kitchen oil free ( difficult ! ) and maintain overall hygiene and you will be well off . all in all qatar be a small and beautiful country . just make sure you do n't introduce few new specie in qatar . : )
 i hate ccs they scare shit outta me

 no ; do n't drink and drive unless you 're one of 'those ' .
 yeah ; i saw it with my own eye !
 yes ; i would agree that if you do n't have your family here ; homesickness will really strike you . now if there be a possibility that you can bring your family ; well . if not ; try to indulge yourself to recreation inside the community ; a lot in dukhan . and i will introduce you to some of my friend who be resident there so you wo n't get bore . having a lot of friend will drive your homesickness away ! when you arrive here ; let 's talk ; i work there but do not live there . `` i 'm back ; simple a that ''
 what be the activity at dukhan ?
 actually it my 1st time to work abroad & be away with my family all the while i think i will be very lonely here but fortunately ; the company ive be work with employ many filipino too & befriend them ... just be strong & think that the reason y we be here be for our family ... with the help of internet connection i can talk to my family whenever i want too ... so i would suggest that u keep ur connection with ur family thru chat & have some friend here : ) so be strong friend ! ! ! think positive : )
 some advice pls what do you think be the best way to do not to feel homesick when i come to qatar ? pls give some helpful advice ... .thanks !

 migtysolomon ... .. thanks for advice ; well where in dukhan be you assign ; im go there this sunday hope to get in touch with you .
 for the form or go to immigration in gharaffa and there be people there who will type/prepare document for a very small fee . initially they will give you a family visit visa good for one month and if you really want to extend for another five month ; then he have to go for medial clearance within seven day upon arrival . but still ; approval of extension still depend upon the mood of the people in the immigration at the time of application ! good luck !
 yes u can ; `` family visa '' go direct in moi fill a form and they will give u 3 month visa and you can extend upto 3 month ...
 will good luck ; unless they change the law without me know anything about it ... you ca n't sponser a son for six month family visa if he be over the age of 20 ... you can have him on a visit visa . goodluck
 as far a i be aware you ca n't sponsor male over a certain age on a family visa . i believe the age be 18 ; but you could get special permission up to the age of 21 . explain the situation to immigration - maybe they can give you an alternative way to get him here . possibly an extended visit visa .
 be 19 and i be tell that he could not be sponsor by me .
 poor guy be ask about the visit visa what have family visa get to do with the topic do n't confuse him and pls stick to the topic avoid misguiding/confusion
 maybe what you mean be validity of entry period ?
 the question be : can i sponsor 23 yr old son for 6 month ? i be tell that i could not sponsor my 19 yr old son for 6 month . yaksbunt ; sorry if that be confuse .
 can i sponsor 23 year old son for 6 month ? my son just finish college and would like to come to doha for 6 month and try and get some work experience . can we sponsor him ? we be uk citizen and our income be sufficient . can we do this and where do i go to get the form . i look forward to your feedback .
 for family visit visa . you be the one confuse . she be ask for her son ( son be part of family ) ; so if you can not contribute something positive ; just keep quiet !
 i believe that after a boy be 18 there be rule that the father can not sponsor him on a permanent visa but can get a visit visa . and those who be still under their dad sponsor before turn 18 have to trf to a company or prove that they be still student to continue to have this status ... . i have no idea if this apply to all nationality but i have this problem with my 20yr old ... ..
 17 and come back for a second visit when he turn 19 . but again ; it all depend on the approve party . there be no harm in accomplish an application and submit it . you only pay when it be approve . if it be reject ; you wo n't pay anything !
 3 month `` family visa '' come on guy try to check from ur hr maybe they can give advice ...
 for every rule there an exemption ... just give valid reason coz my untie have diabetes and they use that a a reason ... get it ...
 ok i take back what i say you be not look for a rp for your son you be only look for a six month family visit ... ..you can get the six month and you can get a nother two so be that the total of eight month ... when you go to the immigration office outside you can ask the typers for the form to be type for you it would cost you three qr and you take it inside door four and they will take your paper and ask you back in one to two weeks.what be you go to need be a noc paper from your sponcer a letter for a salary and a copy of your passport
 i guess it vary on a case to case basis ... ..yeah flor like u say no harm in try ...
 y not u can sponsor him
 bahahahaha

 try look at al ahli hospital . they get goood doctor . but i hope you have enough budget or an insurance card holder .
 hi carol ; it appear from your post that you have not be to a govt hospital ; then it 's a bit presumptuous to state that govt hospital be unreliable . it all depend upon the kind of treatment your look for . there be a pediatrician in al shefa poly clinic in hilal area ; who be good . i have also visit the doctor in medcare centre ; in hilal ; but be not quite satisfied . take care .
 forget about al ahli hospital ! ! ! they charge qr500 only for consultation and the doctor be useless ! ! ! i live here 7years and have 3 kid raise in qatar ; and i promise you ; al ahli be not the way to go . there be a good doctor ; a female right behind the aramex office close to decoration rb . i think it family medical centre . then there be future medical centre opposite villagio ; i go there twice with my young ; be ok ; not super keen with their treatment . it depend why you need to see a doctor . if your child just have a normal cold ; al saad medical centre be great ! i dont have good experiance with any other gov . clinic ; but can take my hat off for the al saad branch ! i know by experience and have many friend that will sware by them . if your child just have a regular cough ; due to the change in weather it likely due to an alergiec reaction to the dust in the air ; they will prescribe you with antihestamine = zyrtec and then a very good and herbal cough syrup = prospan ; these two be all you need every time you kid pass through a viral flu . welcome and good luck . hope my info help .
 yup charlepunt ; go to a private clinic or to a health centre ; if it 's a viral infection or the seasonal flu ; they will give you paracetamol ; prospan ; anti histamine and if the infection have be there for some time ; then they will add a antibiotic to it . so it all depend upon what kind of treatment you be seek . by al sadd medical centre ; be you refer to the ped emergency centre ?
 very good hospital at cheap rate . try once .

 procedures for bring maid from uae hi there we be move from abu dhabi to doha and we be bring our maid with u . does she have to go back to phillipines or can she come with u when we arrive . my husband will get the qatari visa in november after eid and then we will immediately apply for the rest of the family . can we apply for her at the same time and can she come with u when we leave here ? any advice would be appreciate .
 i think u have a mental issue ... a narrow minded one : (
 you can only apply for a license to sponsor a maid once the family visa be process and issue . that be the rule in qatar . and thr whole process take time .
 i like cooky >  <
 it take time a alumnar have mention ...
 wow ; thanks to those that offer advice . it be helpful . so we need to have visa first and then she can get hers . my husband be come to doha for two week after eid to sort out his visa . how long will it take for ours and then hers or can we all apply together . i shall ignore the other comment a they be not worth respond to .
 : o `` ignore the other comment `` i guess then no cookies for you missy >  < hump
 oh and no you wont have to pay for custom unless you be buy like a truck load of it perhaps .
 haha tthanks ... ive be searchng here in doha..
 `` is it any good a the real deal ? '' no ; it 's even bad for you !

 e-cigarrette hi ! i just want to ask first where can i buy electronic cigarette here ? second be i go to pay at the custom if my frend will ship the e-cigarette from my country ?
 thanks speed ; even more reason not to quit smoking now : p either way they be both harmful to health and winner dont quit and quitter dont win : p all be well in the balance of the universe .
 believe it or not ; qatar do not allow sell those in here . they think they be not fully test against side effect . i have a friend who want to get a license to sell those after ship the various part separately . very smart when water vapor 's side effect could be bad than rat poison .
 time ... some thru speed and some thru smoke : -d
 hhahaha ur wife forget to buy u the cigs because of x6 : )

 pseudo smoker be like pimp ... so do these e ciggs have on/off button ?

 just a proof of you and your sister be sibling will do ( birth certificate ; passport ) .
 if she be enter the country on your sponsorship ; ofcourse once you get ok from the ministry that mean you be qualified sponsor a brother and it be ok even to have a same appartment . if she be enter and work in this country on her own ( visa from different sponsor ) then you guy just need to keep the necessary proof handy if and when require ... . that be out of my best knowledge . all the best
 no issue as far a both of the passport show common parent and similar surname
 brother and sister live together does anyone know if a brother and sister can live together legally . my sister be think of come out here to live ; she have the same surname a me a she never marry . if it be ok to live together ; what be the check that be carry out ? thanks
 when apply for ur sister 's visa ; the only proof would be a copy of ur passport as well a ur sister ' . cos ; of the surename ; home address and parent name ; they can confirm the relationship b/w u guy . and der aitn any problem with housing ur sister here in qatar .

 you can try look for a shampoo with hair fall control and use normal temp water when bathing .

 and how will they know you have a one way ticket at the airport ?
 it be none of their business at the check-in counter to know if you have a return ticket or not ; or if you 're come back or not ; it 's entirely your prerogative . if you need an excuse ; `` i be undecided on my date of return ; so i will book it online when i feel it 's time to come back '' ; - )
 your already have exit visa dear ... so no worry ... they dont care if u will come back or not ... what important be u have a plane ticket go home ...
 not coming back can anyone help . will i need to book a return flight even though i plan on not come back to qatar - i.e . will i get stop at qatar airport even though i 'll have an exit visa if i have a one way ticket ? thanks
 no - the check in staff will not bother about if you have any outstanding due ( not say that you have ) . and the immigration officers wo n't give a damn about if you do n't have a return ticket ; they only stop you if you 're on repatriation and have outstanding due .
 all you need be the exit visa and your ticket to leave ! many company issue ticket for the worker to come back while they be on holiday - it be a common practice and we have do it many time . how easy it be for some people to jump to conclusion that you be run away from debts - just ignore those comment and good luck for your next adventure ; wherever it may be : )
 if you have no plan to return ; why not simply resign and do the right thing by the company ? doing a runner simply screw up the visa entitlement for someone else who might enjoy it here .
 baldrick ; although i agree with you ; maybe pierre 's company do not want him to leave ?
 who 's come your way to get one-way air ticket ; further it upto you come back of not ! if company be pay u with return ticket . fly home & no need to come back !
 b2d - most 'bosses ' be not like you and you know that . your word 'voluntarily ' show your respect for your worker ( which be to be praise ) . the op seem to have more serious issue to be able to break free from his sponsor - and with child he need to make sure to get back to the uk for the new school term ; spend christmas at home and and and ... . things which be very important to people like him and many others . sometimes people just snap when the family be not happy - and even 1 week can be like hell if you do n't want to be where you be .
 even u can try by book the return ticket nd u can cancel the same from ur home country
 one-way ticket when go for vacation and our company do the booking of the return trip upon request . so the one-way ticket be not an issue . it 's the exit permit that be very important !
 the immigration will not ask for your return ticket ... .unless you have a cancel visa and they be prompt by the bank that you have loan and obligation

 i believe all kid should be whack when they do something wrong ... it the way our forefather bring u up and look how good we turn out : p
 so true smokie ! ! ! how come everyone today be too much of a hussy to smack their kid around ? ) :
 9pm ? hav be try for long to sleep by tat time ; but usually get to bed by 9 and sleep by 10:30pm ... . : (
 smack that !
 i think whack the child stiffles the creativity and make them scar to think of new idea . however i think if use sparingly and with the other righ ingredient ( coach ; love ... .. ) ; it can be helpful .
 i be talk about parent smack their kids..teachers on the other hand be a big no no . on that note..when i be smack for something i do wrong i always find other creative way to do more naughty thing so that should answer your question . : p
 modern education system spoil the creativity of child ? where do you get that from ?
 spare the rod and spoil the child ? who agree that modern education system spoil the creativity of student ?
 agree with you fatimah ; the occasional smack ; on the right occasion ; can work . but totally against teacher smack kid . smacking be a serious punishment and should n't be give out lightly ; and it need to come from a loving parent .
 somehow the thought of hitting ; even lightly ; another 's child be just wrong . for teacher there be many good way to discipline a child than resort to the kinda corporal punishment our teacher use . now that be quite brutal and far from better u it certainly encourage naughty kid like i be to be more naughty a a form of revenge and defiance .
 we be now in hi-technology era..accept it ; our current child time be different from what we have 50 year ago .
 in today 's day i think we should just take away their facebook privilege : p
 modern education spoil creativity ? ? ? i seem to be live in another world altogether ! ! ! ! agree with both mimi and fatimah . whilst im against harsh discipline a smack once in a while when the situation demand it be ok. then again when your kid become a teen then begin the 'tyrannical ' year ! they will say i hate u atleast once a day cuz we dont allow them to be 'like their friend ' or ' their mom allow them ' ... .. : ) at the end of the day depend on your rapport with your child .
 not always marco . and do you have kid ? ? ? i hope not ! esp with that attitude !
 i think parent should smack their child whenever wherever ; we 're mean to be together.. errrr ... sorry lose the track jokes apart .. i do n't see anything wrong with parent smack their kid `` occasionally '' and when necessary.. but again do not punish your child in front of others because that would make them feel humiliate and ultimately go rebellious.i have see many arab ( parent ) smack their child in public like mall and park etc . which in my opinion be totally wrong.. otherwise ; all be good.. i get punish a lot a a kid.. but look at me now.. all the girl love me .. i can still take some smacking from my father.. : p
 i still like to be smack on my hot bum..any mother like to volunteer ?
 agree with tdkr and tinkerbell10 ... '' modern education spoil creativity ? ? ? i seem to be live in another world altogether ! ! ! ! or where do you hear that ? '' . ... : ) as for smack ; i dont think either at school or at home it be require unless the parent give up on child for any reason . as i understand ; a i grow ; time & patience be the key with parent . and so never get smacked either at home or at school . there be tough session specially with parent but they be patient enough to tell me or my brother and sister their pov listening to our pov ; without the mindset that they be eldest be only right and at time these session would run for day without any hostility or bad feeling .
 smoke.. sorry ; i 'm no mother ; but people like to call me daddy ..and i 'd love to kick your bum
 spare the rod and spoil the child ? who agree that modern education system spoil the creativity of student ?
 @ brit yes i read about that yesterday . do n't know it be allow in us to 'paddle ' the student if they do something wrong and they agree to be paddle or whatever . i agree with the bit of 'smacking ' tho but not to the extent that your kid will just remember that you smack him/her and not the reason why you do it . : (
 what dose modern education produce ? so very much confused student ; and badly train educator .the quality of education in the classroom have go so low so much that student no longer have to conform to classroom general rule and standard . school go student now day can be ask very basic question of their subject and not be able to answer

 all you need be a receiver connect to the pc ; pci or usb ; and a dish . service provider be numerous on the internet .
 it 's not illegal . you be use the dish a if you use satellite tv .
 hey ; man ; and q-tel can not censor the internet !
 is satellite internet available here ? recomme hello all ; is satellite internet available here ? recommended providers and pricing ? apartments where i be at be struggle with abominably slow internet access . does anyone have experience with satellite internet here in qatar ?
 yes it be available . beverley hills tower in west bay use to have it for all apartment there . no idea of provider or cost though .
 the average price in the us be 50 $ per month for 1 mb data transfer . prices depend if it 's one-way or two-way . a dedicated two-way connection with unlimited data transfer be around 250.000 us $ per month . if you really want to know ; search the internet .
 http : //www.ehow.com/how check this link above on how to install satellite dish for internet .. i have never try this way and i do n't know if it will work well or not .. try it on your own responsibility
 maybe just call qtel and find out what the problem be ? i pay for a 4mb line and actually connect at 4.8m down / 650k up . its not blaze fast compare to the western world ; but for what it be i can connect to torrent upward of 500k per second . qtel also offer an 8m line ; but there be a restriction on the distance to the local hub . i think they say 800m and mine just happen to be ~1200m away . the tech on the phone do inform me they be work on fiber optic ; but would not be available for another year ( which probably mean 2 in doha time ) . you can get up to 50mb download speed in the us with fiber internet . the big problem here be the pricing . qtel charge a whopping 400qar for a 4mb line . anywhere else this speed can be have for a fraction of the cost . even 5 year ago i be pay the equivalent of ~150qar for a 4mb line in the us . prices here be absolutely rediculous !

 qatar be one of safe country in the world ; and i be sure who be live in qatar can be witness however ; for dubai ; i know it superficially only and i can not confirm or deny
 in some case ; it could be true if you have fall into a sponsor who be actually a pimp . examples be sponsor who employ for waitress job at hotel and pub . the actual job do would be a flesh trade .
 be live alone in the gulf and qatar dangerous for single woman ? i 've hear so many sad story about arab woman who be just sexually harrassed or even bad by their sponsor ! ! ! is it true ? i be tell that the sponsor keep the passport of single woman work for them ! be it true ? source : my neighbour who be in dubai for a few month .
 i felt safe and secure here ... same applies to single woman . kids can play on the street with no problem . you can even walk with your jewelery on . always be positive and you will be ok . welcome to doha..
 not true . qatar be one of the safe country in the world .
 i do n't think you can hold two gcc visa ; unless it be the same company you be work for and they apply the visa ; i think you would have to cancel dubai visa in order to get your qatar visa stamp on your passport . this be what i have also only heard ; so please get it confirm .
 first you have to cancle dubai visa and all bank loan ect . will be clear and there will not be any case/charge against you in dubai . then you can get qatar or other gcc residence/work visa . none can keep both same time .
 no you ca n't hold both rp at same time .
 you have to cancel your uae visa 100 % sure a i join qatar recently from dubai . otherwise your company will make you travel back to dubai at your expense to get your uae visa cancel . same happen to two guy who join with me from dubai . so dont take chance . i be 100 % sure .
 hello 'rp31 ' you have mention that 2 people have to return to uae to cancel their uae visa before qatar rp be process . could you please confirm whether they be in managerial visa in uae plus a similar visa in qatar . thanks

 has anyone heard about the new trafiic rule ? decree # 19 ? ? ? or be it a hoax ? ? ?
 saw landcruiser at busy intersection on al waab yesterday with father drive with toddler on his lap and a zillion other kid jump around all over the place inside . yes ; i know it 's nothing new ; but it really be time the police enforce the law concern this . that kid would just have be mince if he 'd have an accident . makes me want to cry .
 in a major move to curb the grow number of accident and incident of reckless drive on qatars road ; the government yesterday promulgate a new traffic law ; stipulate severe penalty for violator include a point system which would ultimately lead to the cancellation of a habitual offender drive license . decree no 19 of 2007 ; issue by hh the deputy emir and heir apparent sheikh tamim bin hamad al-thani ; state that a driving license may be suspend for three month when the total violation reach 14 point for the first time . if the same person gather 12 point again ; his license would be suspend for six month ; nine month on the accumulation of the next 10 point and one year for the next eight point . ultimately ; a driving license may be cancel if the same offender earn six point for the fifth time . the penalty for use mobile phone while drive have be enhance . the violator will have to pay a minimum fine of qr 3 ; 000 and a maximum fine of qr 10 ; 000 . he be also liable for imprisonment for up to one year . motorists who commit violation such a drive with no authorized license ; drive under the influence of liquor ; drive in the opposite direction of traffic flow ; escape from the accident site ; cause sound and air pollution and exceed the speed limit would be punishable by imprisonment from one month to three year or fin qr10 ; 000 to 50 ; 000 or both . according to the new law ; the punishment for the following offence be also the same a mention above : not wear seat belt ; allow child below 10 year sit in the front passenger seat ; not give way to official motorcade and the vehicle of the police ; civil defense and ambulance ; not leave enough space between two vehicle and motorcyclist allow another passenger sit behind them ( pillion rid ) . the law stipulate that the driver and the front seat passenger should wear seat belt all the time . cyclists should keep to the right side of the road and should ride in one line . motorcyclists be not allow to ride on one wheel . both should wear helmet . violation points system violators of traffic rule will be give negative point a follow : jumping the red light 7 driving in the opposite direction 6 driving under the influence of alcohol 6 exceeding the maximum speed 4 driving recklessly and dangerously 4 driving with defective brake 4 driving with inappropriate license 3 driving with strip or invalid license 3 violating norm of public morality 3 driving an unregistered vehicle 3 driving a vehicle without number plate 3 unauthorized change make to number plate 3 providing wrong information to pass the technical inspection 3 using the vehicle for the wrong purpose 3 blocking the flow of traffic intentionally 3 driving a vehicle without a proper silencer 3 driving a polluting vehicle 3 driving a vehicle that leak any material that can damage the road 3 driving a vehicle which drop load which can endanger the public safety 3 driving on the embankment 3 making a wrong u-turn 3 changing a vital part of the vehicle without a write permission from the authority 3 giving the license to someone who have no license 2 driving a vehicle with unclear number plat 2 driving with only one number plate ; or change their shape or detail 1 refraining from give drive license to traffic police 1 trucks violate the load condition 1 trucks violate the width ; length ; or weight regulation of the vehicle 1 driving a technically unsafe vehicle 1 using light ; horn ; microphone ; or other machine against the law 1 disobeying traffic sign 1 [ img dude|desc=happiness come only once dont miss it|link=none|align=left|width=|height=0 ]
 have to say this one cover pretty much anything `` violating norm of public morality 3 '' it will only be an issue for non local anyway . `` the penalty for use mobile phone while drive have be enhance . the violator will have to pay a minimum fine of qr 3 ; 000 and a maximum fine of qr 10 ; 000 . he be also liable for imprisonment for up to one year '' the above be a joke.i have see 4 police officer either call or texting when drive . so to sum up ; waste of time . the bad driver will not get penalise .
 qatar have very strict traffic law ; now more than any where else in the world but i still see some people excersing rash driving . nothing have change in the driving trend it be the same .
 but the guy above do ... they get seriouus finally ... you ca n't teach experience ...
 adnanmzfr - they may have strict law ( though personally i do n't think they 're particularly strict compare to other country ) but they 're all pretty much pointless a they 're not enforce by the police .

 what be the average qtel internet speed for the 200 riyal package ? ? what be the average qtel internet speed for the 200 riyal package ? i use one that 's be give through my apartment and the speed a i check a while ago be 0.08 mbps and it usually this speed allday and just want to know if it worth change
 i have a similar problem with my connection . qtel be able to prove that my bandwith be 1 mbps and they doubt my wifi router instead ... however i google it and find out that if i be use a wireless router and it be position near a cordless phone or a microwave ; it would reduce my bandwidth and so i remove my cordless phone from next to the router and now i get the full quota of the bandwidth . lem me know if u have any question
 you can check the actual speed here : http : //www.speedtest.qa
 i get aroung 1mbps
 not allow .
 i dont think you can find one ; but go to centerpoint ; 1st floor . u can find the entire furniture and electronics . can chk the price .
 thanks for the suggestion . problem be i 'm not in qatar yet ; ( cheers sk
 there really be n't any website here like you be describe . there be no ikea or best buy either . no wal marts ; targets ; thing of that nature . i would say if you have to make arrangement for your house before you get here ; get a furnished place . you will have to hunt around the mall ( not really any american store there ) and also the souqs for furnishing . hope that help . motherhood ... the hard job you 'll ever love ! : )
 visit www.emaxme.com ; they be present in many country and will atleast give u some idea about electronics .
 hi . been recently look at accomodation and the cost between furnish and unfurnished . in my opinion it be well to rent unfurnished . the difference in some place be 1000-2000qr a month . over a year ( 12 000 ) you could quite easily buy your own . whatever you vividly imagine ; ardently desire ; sincerely believe and enthusiastically act upon ; must inevitably come to pass .

 no . there be no visa available easily for person above 60 year of age . the hotel-sponsored visa be the only type . you need not approach a five-star hotel for this . there be several cheap hotel in doha which can sponsor such a visa . the cost would be around us $ 100 to us $ 150 per day ; depend upon how much the hotel charge for one room per night .
 agreed with metro
 parent visa for above 70 year age i like to bring my parent for 1 or two week in qatar.i try for tourist visa at airport.but ; they rejected.now ; authority advice to book only five star hotel for tourist visa.it be impossible to spend money for five star hotel for me.is it possible anytype ( include tourist ) of visa ; which can bring my parent here ? if so ; please send form and tell me process . thanks in advance .
 got to the hukoomi website . once there select the tourist visa section then select a joint tourist visa and fill in the form for each parent ; you will need their passport detail . i do this last year for my parent ; both over 70 . be careful though a you only get 1 month from the date of creation so make sure it cover them for the whole stay ; you can not choose a start date . they give you an instant answer and it only cost 100 riyal per visa . good luck : )
 go to immigration department and ask someone there . i have hear that there be people who can get you a visa for over 60 parent but he will charge you for his service . please dont send me any pm that 's all i have hear .

 you can get fox sports here on the osn satellite network . try look on the listing www.osnetwork.com to see if they be carry the game you want ( hopefully they 're not time delay )
 osn show live nrl ; plus afl and most rugby so it a pretty good sport package if you be from down under . currently they be show the ashes live which be great .

 there be a marhaba service who can assist them with immigration and baggage . you ca n't .
 marycatherine ; perhaps ; you mean al maha services.. consider go to the al maha counter for a hassle free service . give your family flight iterinary to the al maha agent inside the arrival terminal and pay a small fee for their service . once your family arrive at the arrival terminal ; ask them to proceed to the al maha outlet before the immigration counter to their left.. tell them to announce to the al maha representative about their name . they will be ask to wait in the spacious and comfortable lounge . an al maha rep will collect their passport and visa and clear their immigration for them and then come back to collect your family in 10 minute . your family will be lead through the immigration counter to the baggage pickup area counter where they can identify their luggage . they will direct someone to load the luggage onto a trolley and walk out near the public area where you can identify them cheers

 i think you 're have a wrong picture in your mind . if your baby be bear in qatar ; he/she will not be issue with visit visa . visit visa be issue only to a person outside qatar and for the purpose of visit . if you have do the birth certificate and have sign the document at cid ( due to 2 sponsers for you and your wife ) ; your baby be issue with the rp . i think it 's good you show your baby rp ( or visa a you say ) to somebody who can read arabic and get confirm .
 something not right here ... my husband and i be with different sponsor . our baby be bear a few month back ; and be issue a family visa . quite straightforward . the only extra step be u 'll need to go to the cid office and show them ur paper . once the baby get his passport ; u 'll need to go back there with a copy of the passport . ( no idea why though )

 hit up al shamal road and start count your distance from landmark shopping mall . keep head north on al shamal road ( not al khor road which take you straight to al khor and pass the lusail intl . circuit on your left ) for about 75.55km you will come to an interchange ( still under construction ) with a small blue sign before the bridge reading [ al fuwairit > ] you will want to take the dirt road with that sign and keep drive down a very bumpy road until you hit the fishing village . to get to the beach ; take a left before the village and follow the unpaved road to the beach . got a gps ? also ; would n't recommend go there without a 4x4 ; some spot have nasty soft sand . check it out on google earth before you go . feel free to pm . good luck !
 head northwest to al shamal road . landmark set km to `` 0 '' after 77kms turn right . after 3.9 km turn leave for 450meters . youl be in the area .
 whaiql 's blog be really nice ; with picture too . you turn leave just before you enter the village ; the road look like the 5th picture from the top in whaiql 's blog . trees on either side and a wooden barricade . again ; to the 4x4 issue ; some spot do have soft sand . you can probably find a way through on hard ground though . it 's not an unpopular beach ; so if you do get stick ; there should be someone around to dig you out ; especially on the weekend .

 without get paper from your company it be not possible ; your company have to give paper to you then only possible ; otherwise ; you can approach any hotel visa or qatar airway visa ; which be bit costly ; but there you dont require company paper .
 yes there be travel agency can help you to obtain a tourist and business visa but if your question be if possible for you to have them a family visit visa i think it not possible because you need an noc from your company that allow you to sponsor your family for a visit.goodluck

 absolutely ca n't without your company permission .

 you need a letter of no objection from your company if you want to get your family here on visit visa .
 arrange a job first . or go on a visit visa and search for a job .

 a good sun tan will the do the trick.. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - he who dares wins

 owen.. you make me laugh and cry at the same time..chicken pox ? ? .. be n't it a kid ' illness ; particularly those under age 12 ? poor thing.. i be really sorry to hear it.. : ( here be some advice : get rid of chickenpox scars step1 talk to a dermatologist . have your skin and scar evaluate by a professional before you try any product or home remedy . a dermatologist will have many different option for you to consider . step2 apply sandalwood oil and vitamin-e onto your skin . if you scar be not a deep or old ; you can rub some sandalwood oil vitamin-e base product onto your scar . do this consistently for a few month until the scar have heal . step3 try laser treatment . if the scar be old or very deep ; cream and lotion will most likely not work . you might have to consider remove these type of scar with an intense laser treatment at your dermatologist 's office . step4 consider excision by your dermatologist or doctor . excision be the removal of scar by cut them off and stitch the skin close . this option be especially suitable for deep scarring . you will still have some scarring ; but it will be much less noticeable than the chickenpox scar . step5 get a microdermabrasion treatment . microdermabrasion be a deep facial peel that remove a very fine layer of skin . this process will remove scar from on the surface of your skin . get this process do at a clinic or certify spa for best result . good luck sweetie.. : ) < i > < b > ********************* you become responsible forever for what you have tame . antoine de saint-exupry < /b > < /i > < img src= '' http : //cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif '' >

 i feel for you honey ... have the chicken pox when i be 25 year old and 3 month pregnant with my first child . ( remind me to thank my mom again for keep me `` safe '' from all those other kid with the pox ; when i be little ! ! ) do what qs say ... and i be go to say vitamin e capsule work wonder for scar . just get the capsule from gnc ; puncture one end of the capsule and apply..rub it in throughly ... keep out of the sun for at least 6 month ( or use really strong sunscreen ) tho a new skin ; such a scar ; will tan differently than other skin ... grant me the senility to forget the people i never like ; the good fortune to run into the one i do ; and the eyesight to tell the difference .
 do to help you until you heal up ? if you be still itchy..try pulverize dry oatmeal and put it in a tub of lukewarm water and sit until you ca n't stand the cold anymore ... help you from want to scratch yourself to death . grant me the senility to forget the people i never like ; the good fortune to run into the one i do ; and the eyesight to tell the difference .
 if you can get ano nighttime antihistamine that should help with the itch also..valtrex be an antiviral med ... and although the chickenpox be viral ; it wo n't really help with the itching . you will also be contagious until the very last pox have dry up and fall off ... so take your time and get well ! ! ! grant me the senility to forget the people i never like ; the good fortune to run into the one i do ; and the eyesight to tell the difference .

 go to hamad women 's hospital ; bring all your necessary document . my wife give birth there a couple of year ago . i only pay 200 qr for the room + around 35 qr for medicine and vitamin . great service too .
 in hamad hospital you will be best service in the world and they charge only 200 riyal maximum that be room charge only . in al-ahli it will be about 15 ; 000 to 20 ; 000 ; ( my friend 's wife deliver there and they pay this amount )

 yes u cud surely get a pair of jean for 60qr ... . but that be sooo 5 year ago !
 um . i 'm sure clothing price in uk be more expensive than in doha . 60-100 riyal jean ? you could work on that . i 'm sure there 's a place where you can find a good deal . ; o )
 i think clothes price be high in uk than here..but it 's always wise to buy clothes during sale season a u can really get good deal during those times..
 it depend on the brand . as a general rule most uk brand ( such a bhs ; next ; m & s ; h & m ) be price at an exchange rate of qr7 to 1 . as the current rate be closer to qr5 to 1 clothes will be cheap in the uk . on top of this retailer be discount heavily in the uk because of the recession . if you look at some french or spanish brand ( zara ) they be cheaper in doha .
 i agree that now the exchange rate be so low then clothes be deifnitely cheap back in uk especially with the great sale that be on there at the moment . unless you buy from a recognised brand here the quality be not very good ; so my be advice take a holiday back in uk and fill your suitcase with all the bargain there ! !
 clothes price in doha ? i be wonder if the price in doha be high than in the uk . can there be good deal on sale like let say jean for 60-100 qr ? just want to get an idea . thanks
 a pair of undies be cost qr 45 here ...
 thanks ; guy . that be really helpful . i be still in the uk . but soon will be moving.i be go to bring everything from here i guess . as the price here be fantastic now like linen trouser at next on sale be 8 ( 44 qrs ) . so do n't think anything could beat that on price and quality .
 your employer should be help you this ; but you need to take your passport ; 100qr ( fee ) ; and the paper that be print out from your sponsor . when you get there just ask where to sit and wait for your turn .

 job offer i 'm new here . i be currently employ a executive secretary for almost 3 year in lpg industry here in the philippines and my past experience be event management and customer service job . i have a job offer of 550 usd basic + 80 usd free accommodation and transportation . i be a first timer . my question be ; is this enough ? the job be admin/secretary in doha ; qatar .
 negotiate with your salary that be not enough and unfair for you
 3 ; 000 qr to 12 ; 000 qr depend on experience .
 it that salary for a month ? 550usd/month ? be they kid . it equal to qr2000/month . and usd80 ( qr300 ) for accommodation ? do n't risk your life . here u will never get that qr300 of accommodation .
 it 's barely above what a housemaid would make .
 yups do n't take the risk and search for good ...
 it 's not enough ; look for other offer
 please advice ; 17000 qr + 3500 qr/pm housing+ 2000 qr/pm transport

 italians in doha hi ; i 've just receive an offer for an expat job in doha ; some 120.000 $ and i 'm wonder if there be an italian comunity there diego
 thanks ; i 've already look there and unfortunately there be n't an italian one . i mention the salary just to understand if it 's reasonable or not diego
 whats your position ? i mean job prof ?
 treasury specialist
 you serious ? : #
 i make more than that and i be not a treasury specialist : - ) ) rofl ! ! ! !
 my ceo earn hell no . of time than him . he be also not a treasury analyst right ? . what if you be in a big position than him ? : )
 i see ; do you have a full expat package ?
 i 've notice a lot of people mention their salary on qatarliving . ~*speak when you be angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret*~
 i know a bunch of guy in one of the multinational banks in treasury who make more than that and this be two year ago ... having say that ; i be no expert on finance ... all i know be that these be guy with about 10 to 15 year work ex like lorenteggio ...
 if it one of the national bank ; the offer would be less than that of some of the multinational financial institution ... 'some ' ... not all ...
 italians in doha hi ; i 've just receive an offer for an expat job in doha ; some 120.000 $ and i 'm wonder if there be an italian comunity there diego
 lorenteggio ; it be alright . you be not the first person to do so . but it just the way people could ask . maybe something like ; how much would suffice for a good life in qatar . people on qatarliving vary in status and the salary vary as well . people earn qr2000 to qr 150000 a month . so ; it might hurt people to know that others be make what they would save in 350 year . just my opinion . i wish you a happy stay in qatar once you arrive . ~*speak when you be angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret*~
 we be both new to the forum so it be ok. we will learn from each other . welcome to qatar in advance and i be sure you will have a pleasant time . ~*speak when you be angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret*~
 not yet decide ; we will see
 there be a thrive community ... .with a very active embassy . but why do you italian guy keep switching-off the aircon and open the window ? ... lol
 ciao lorenteggio i 'm not in finance so couldn'tcomment how that offer compare with the local rate ; but i would say that you have to judge how much good of you 'll be than at home . cost of living be definitely high than in italy ; but depend a lot if you have accomodation include . you 're go to pay at least qar14 ; 000 per month for somewhere ok to live . if it 's only a little above average salary at home then i 'd say it be n't go to make you a lot good off ; but this depend on your tax situation . not sure how the italian tax work ; but no tax payable here . you have to bear in mind that while qatar be very safe and you can buy most thing here ( prosciuto except ! ) ; it 's not the most comfortable or exciting place to live . so you 'll end up spend a lot on flight and holiday to stay sane . good luck fg
 thank for the comment ; as far a i 've see cost of living be high here in europe than in qatar thanks to the strong eur
 lorenteggio ; se ti caput anche solo di venire qui qualche gg giusto per farti un idea di cosa sia vivere in qatar ( io ci sto da + di 1 anno ) mandami un msg in privato e ci mettiamo in comunicazione . saluti mauro ps : e ' un ottimo salario se hai full expact benefit ! ! !
 he look really funny
 sorry ; italian like look ; but do italians have good courage ; omg ; i do n't have ; my black and bald bil scar me ; he look like an animal

 wow look very costly get the imei number from the box of each cell phone that it to capital police and they will do their work
 i agree with first answer to report both
 how to track lose mobile ? one of my friend lose his costly mobile yesterday nite @ around 10 pm ( two mobile ; htc hd2 and sony ericsson m600i ) in karwa taxi while travel back from ramada to matar qadeem . whether it should be report to police or we can approach karwa office ? what will be feasible.. ? suggestion please ...
 mmm..lost world dude
 there be option in iphone 4 to trace your lose mobile and you can view it in map that where be locate ; i fond my one in philippians ; lol ; haha ; but i get my one through that ;
 well here be the thing ; it depend upon the system in place . if they want they can trace the mobile phone with approximate location . there be an imei of each mobile mobile . and when ever a mobile phone get register to the network or make a phone call or send sms ; there be an entry record in database with sim number + imei number . so if someone be use your friend 's mobile phone ; they definitely have the record of it . and they can trace the guy as well . the best way be to goto police and report it .
 do not worry . go to police station and they will register your complain and through your imie no they will trace your the lose phone even your cell be off even he remove your sim card . through imei police will trace the guy as well .
 you can get these in march and not before they 'll probably begin in villagio or citycentre
 corr ; he have type in the correct name in the subject `` voda fone '' . it may be a typo mistake in the text . it be a global company and statring opearations from mar 09. their phone number will start from digit 7 .
 it seem a the guy mi spell the name ; the correct name be voda fone . actualy ; voda fone sims be not available now for purchase ; till the month of march in villagio . best of luck
 not yet available in the market ; however ; soon it will be a yesterday they start the marketing / promotion in villagio at around 7:30pm . that be fun ! ! cheers..

 i be not marry ; but i have see my cousin mom and dad force out of facebook by their own child ; which be really sad ... .
 i 'm a friend of both of my child on facebook ; but usually i notice child be unhappy to have their parent on facebook ...
 be on fb
 why would a parent want to be a friend of a child on fb unless they be be nosy ?
 i be not in that situation actually coz my baby be still small to do all these..but i be sure she too will do the same once she will grow up..hehehe.. neither my father nor my mom be the member of any social networking site..though my sibling be there in my list but i have put them under the category of family ( a bro or si ) ..
 well ; it 's quite simple.. if you be hide something from your parent ; you wo n't be so happy to have them a friend in your fb.. if you be secret free ; it 's not really a problem..
 soniya you be brown ; stay away from fb ; it be a white guy 's invention ... .
 being a friend on facebook do n't mean at all that youre a friend of him a in real life ... actually it signify that you have some connection with the person that 's it .
 good job ! hjasdhwqyi ; employ of the year ! ! !
 height of friendship ... has your daughter/son put you a a friend in her/his facebook list of friends.. not out of force for you to keep an eye ; but out of her/his own will ... .
 everyday ; spammer with new id keep flood ql . this be so annoying .
 wk ; i know u r no more on ql..so i wo n't comment on ur post..
 parents can get in any way ... with some other id and you think it some stranger ... or some friend 's friend ! is that too hard ?
 i be sure that the child would be less open if they know that their parent be link to them on facebook..
 quite hard ; jack mohan.. : - )
 jack ; i think a parent that do that need medical attention . and brit ; it all about how you raise your child .
 wats the use of make fake profile ... . ? ? ?

 its true . be careful . try not to jump on your date .
 as long a you both dont go overboard with pda no worry ... ... ... ...
 hi.this country have it own culture that we both expatriate and local to be aware of ; hence should be follow . you ca n't blame anybody once you get into these kind of trouble . so well you always bear in mind that you be work and live in a country where traditional value be strictly be adapt and observe by the authority . good luck
 you need to be careful even if you take your dad out for a drive ; rule of traffic ; otherwise you could endanger safety of the road .
 me and my girlfriend be often date here in doha..almost evryday..for almost 2 yrs.i think it 's safe here ; nothing to worry about .
 qatar be an islam country . to let you understand ; try to have a date in saudi arabia with your girlfriend and if you would be lucky enough - you would see what i mean . dating with your girlfriend here in the middle east be unacceptable to islam tradition ! !
 rule number 1 : do not hold hand . rule number 2 : do not kiss . rule number 3 : do not hug for more than 3 second . rule number 4 : do not attempt fornication of any kind whatsoever ( especially in public ) . rule number 5 : if any of the above rule be flout ; make sure you lock room ; draw curtain and increase volume of the music to a substantial level .
 qatar be a very safe country ; there be no problem here for date but you have to keep in mind that this be an islamic country and have to respect the law of qatar . try not to get carry away in public ...
 yes it be true mostly now a day b care ful

 try both and see who give you the best price !
 sell it outside ; there be no way that toyota dealership will pay you fair . definitely much low than market price so they can have profit for re-selling .
 i 'll try to get an appraisal in toyota trade-in section . if their offer will not suit my expectation ; then probably this go for an auction to direct buyer anyone know how much the market value for this model ?
 car trade-in issue i be plan to dispose my toyota land cruiser 2004 gx automatic gear due to a possible change with the late model . what be the best way to do it ; sell it thru a direct buyer or have it trade-in in toyota itslef ... .
 yes . trade in be less problem/head ache but less cost . sell it to direct buyer will earn you little sum of money compare to trade-in but you have to deal with different type of people .
 as others be say ; a trade-in be less hassle for you ; but you 'll get much less money for the vehicle . selling it to a private buyer will get your more money but it will be much more of a hassle and potentially take a long time .
 btw ; what much be ur demand for lc 2004 model ? ? would you like to share with u here..
 i do n't have accurate demand yet ; but for sure a little bit high than the market value ... .
 only if housing be provide .
 basic or package ; it differ ; if basic ; not bad at all ; if package ; you will eat steamed rice for the rest of your residency here ...
 go to medical health centre of the region in which u abide like if u r in ummgualina then go to mughlina health centre or if in rayyan go to the rayyan one othrwise for al khor al khor one . u make there ur own card for 100 qr per year & u hav to renew after every month for qr 100 again . u need to have visa for that . u can hav treatment for free the entire year with one card . however if u dnt want to make card u hav to pay qr 30 per visit . these informations are about the gov one if you wan na make your treatment in any private then u go to national or nearby thr u will find some who give treatment at 5o qr or so . however there r hospitals like appollo u can hav there basically the gov one is affordable ... ..
 go to hmc emergency ; get what u need ; later do ur health card for future requirement
 no ; it 's client approval which be approval should be take from the main project client before start the visa process .
 sounds like good advice from your employer
 client approval hi ; i have accept offer to work in qatar a a civil engineer ; but the company tell me not to hand my notice in until get the client approval . i have not come across this client approval before . i would appreciate your advice and any idea how long this approval will take and be it easy to get this approval ? thanks for your help in advance . mego
 yes ; true they should get prior approval from the client or consultant before they be able to hire you ; mean a copy of your cv be send to them as well and you might be interview by them too..
 all job in qatar on contingent on your get a visa ; so even if you come and go through the last few stage ; your visa may or may not be approve . you would have to leave then and no compensation would be provide . only you can decide if you want to take that leap . thousands be successful ; but if you be one of the very few who be not it can be devastate .
 it be the time require to get your cv approve by the ultimate client ( ashghal etc. ) . it 's for your benefit to get you approve before you hand your notice . as someone mention the visa process may still collapse but at least the client approval stage will confirm that the client will pay for your work lol . your grade and salary be likely to be base on that as well . it take approx . 10-14 day in my case .
 any more thought
 yes ; client approval be generally the preferred way to work for engineering consultancy . the main reason be that company dont want to hire someone from overseas and bring them all the way to qatar and then find out that the client do not like them for some reason like lack of experience ; etc . therefore ; to save themselves the hassle and money ; company usually hire people officially once client have see their cv and be happy to have them on the job . hope this help !

 sorry for the spell mistake it toyota **  '' live for nothing or die for something '' 
 it depend on your budget as well but i prefer toyota prado 2008
 well budget be not a prob ... . alhamdulilah i be just ask which one be good ? thanks  '' live for nothing or die for something '' 
 guyz i know u can help me ; ) i be soon go to buy a car for myself and i like 2 car 1 ) toyata prado 2008 2 ) honda crv 2008 so can you suggest me which one be good ? thanks : )
 http : //www.qatarliving.com/node/884191 hey omar bhai ; just go thru the above link..i really want u to answer on the above link to one person blablu..well i cant help u in decide which model u want though ...
 prado for sure omer . cant compare both .
 ok soniya jii no prob : )  '' live for nothing or die for something '' 
 performance wise ; i suggest you prado v6 rather than a crv.crv be a good family car.trust me ; never go for prado v4 ; it suck big time.but prado be more common a well..
 taste differ !
 that be delusional omar.i never claim so.if your nonsensical comment be just to satisfy soniya ; tell me man..i can stand up for that ! i have see better..
 oh c'mon man it not for anyone.. i be just give answer what you be say ok bablu  '' live for nothing or die for something '' 
 omar ... .go for it ! seven seater big family car v6 vx model be really good . you need to loose your pocket ; it would be in the range of qar 110-120k
 hey omar ... i use to lyk honda crv in canada ; but later after rid it do n't like it much ; honest opinion go for toyata prado 2008 ... it have more bold body then crv . - : you love me or you hate me but i will always be in your mind : -
 ye ye ; i know..i can make out your face expression now..its ok dude ; i should n't have tell that in public rather use a pm.next time bro ; if you come to scratch me ..
 guyz i know u can help me ; ) i be soon go to buy a car for myself and i like 2 car 1 ) toyata prado 2008 2 ) honda crv 2008 so can you suggest me which one be good ? thanks : )
 omar of course prado v6 . it be powerfull ; safe ; have good option and look ; and good aftersale price . the prado v4 have a very weak 2.4 l engine ( take into consideration the weight of the vehicle and the double ac ) .
 hahaha bablu that 's what you think .. no prob 's i can understand : )  '' live for nothing or die for something '' 
 another vote for toyota prado ... listen to the sound of silence ... .
 crv look good
 prado peace : )
 prado be perfect .
 your question be difficult to answer and the only person who know the answer be you.if you want a mean powerful offroader that can seat 7 in comfort then prado be your choice . on the other hand you want a slick city cruiser that can manage minimal offroading then go for the cr-v . it look real nice if you mod it just right . both car be good value for money . if it be the 2.4l prado you be look at then definitely go for cr-v a the 2.4l mill which perform well in the camry be n't good enough to get the gargantuan across town . ride comfort be high in the cr-v and handling be near saloon level . the prado on the other hand be belittle by the humble corolla around a round about . road noise level be also higher in the prado especially when wear bridgestone donut . you also get more toy for the money you pay on a cr-v. prado can go just about anywhere with it 's optional 4wd system with rear and central diff lock . it 's get a huge petrol tank that take age to fill and age to empty . the value never depreciate and look like it never will a the 2010 prado may soon turn out to be damp squib and a possible chink in toyota 's armor a full time 4wd may not be everyone 's cup of tea . in the end listen to your heart . if you need further help pm me a i just love car and all thing relate ... also check out www.drivearabia.com for more opinion and review .
 live life king size . so go for prado it be more efficient and powerful than crv . it be the best substitute for big daddy land cruiser . ejaz m khatib mobile : +9746787860

 i will suggest you green land nursery ; it in between aramex roundabout & mamoura signal ( new mamoura complex ) if you be come from doha ; cross d ring road signal & mammoura signal ; go straight 200 meter on your right ... .. near archidron construction office .
 be it that you need these plant for home or in your office.i could suggest you eden internatinal ; they do it for u in our office.i do not know there exact location but i do know there contact num:5238568.they even do the maintenace work like water it etc ; which make u free from takin care of it n it look lively evrytime .

 i think that the new barwa building on c ring rd.. next to patchi shop suhaim bin hamad street ... call 800 4444 http : //www.waseef.qa/en-properties/barwa-al-sadd
 you can contact the head of dept for the food control dept at 4347633 . maybe they can assist you .
 in normal situation the doha municipality be responsible for carry out inspection in this regard . as mention ; complaint can be make through the municipality website www.baladiya.gov.qa under the food observation section . alternatively ; they can be reach on food observation section - doha municipality phone number : 4347631 - 4347663
 i also recommend go public through the paper ; i believe they have the most impact in such case . retailers have screw up one time too many ; and this need to stop . i still can remember buying expired diaper for my infant from city center 's major retail shop ; only to be give a cold shoulder by the manager and an offer for a credit note ; at the end i make sure they learn their lesson < grin >

 download a converter from the net . it free .
 from .cda to .mp3 hi all ; need your help here.. does anybody know how to convert a .cda to .mp3 ? i 've be try to transfer some music on to my phone with cda extension name but i guess the phone do not recognize that file type so i need to find a way to convert it into an mp3 file . thanks in advance..
 sony soundforge can do that . it extract the audio from the cd and you can save it then in whichever format you want .
 mj try to rip it first use window medium player then download allok video converter it have most of the format . `` < b > in my opinion only . . . nothing personal < /b > '' < a title= '' everything you need to know about living in doha ; qatar '' href= '' http : //www.qatarliving.com '' > < img src= '' http : //static.qatarliving.com/badges/150x50 '' alt= '' everything you need
 mjamille you just use the window medium player and put the cd and click rip it will convert the .cda to .mp3 .
 yes ; basically : the .cda file be representation of cd audio track and do not contain the actual pulse code modulation ( pcm ) information . cda file can be play only from a cd-rom . this mean you have to 'rip ' the song from the cd use a software ; there be plenty of them around the net ( i 've be use soundforge and it 's very cool even if maybe be quite difficult for a newbie to understand ) .
 i be sure you can use ashampoo to rip it and convert it to mp3 . perhaps other software such a nero can do it as well ... i be not aware . google search ; perhaps you find a freeware for that purpose .

 cherry u be still confuse . do n't show him any weakness ; your bos be think all filipina 's be the same ; he might do this thing in some woman before ; he might be expert of this activity . dont be afraid to lose your job otherwise you will loose dignity etc ... .. you know what i mean . be strong and fight !
 make sense ... .
 so many good advice . its up to you . if you dont want to be abuse ; so fight and never let somebody do it to you . you can talk directly to some kabayans here . you 're boss might also be here in ql and if thats youre real name and picture this will be disadvantageous to you .
 you good do this ask for assistance of polo locate in bin omran . no need arabic translator
 if this your real identity ; change your profile and name now and remove your photos . your boss might be around . you will be in danger . he will have an idea now how to get getaway with this . yala ... .. make yourself invisible .
 avoid accept any gift from him . he might think that u also like him or give him false hope ... . at the end he can use it against u ... so be careful !
 so what if he know somebody from the cid ? why need to be scar if u know that ur in the right position ?
 ana ganda what you the same ?
 just call 999 and they will come for you ; police in here be good and kind unlike other country .
 thanks just1s . thank the courage . i will try it at night ; he tell me to take ot again today .
 how to report my bos ? how to report my bos ; he be offer me indecent proposal . i tell him many time that i have already a bf here . i 'm afraid he might terminate me from my work . please help .
 azi be right..but still someone can help her . as you say it indecent proposal ; its just a proposal ... but if he start abuse you ; it another story . you can report him to the police/cid ; owwa or maybe the philippine embasy .
 brave it not only proposal ; he start to kiss me lately in my neck and hold my hand while give some document .
 hi there ; 1 ) first get solid proof of his advance . 2 ) do not show encouragement by smile when he offer you something you dont like . 3 ) inform the hr or change the department you work at . 4 ) you may be scar ; but dont let it show in your face or body language 5 ) use ; go to the police a a last resort .
 geez how can you let him get away with it ? you should 've do something right away when he do that to you.. he must 've think you have no objection over what he do !
 they think that all filipinas be easy girl ... ... bec some of our kabayans be like that ... ..very very sad ...
 so thats it ; it clear it be not an indecent proposal anymore . it 's abuse..so ask some good kabayans here to get to the police and report the incedent .
 ahh ok. and also because here in ql many filipino post nonsense or sometimes sensitive nonsense issue that we bacame laugh stuff here . pansin ko lang .
 yeah right ... .. pansin ko din
 have the proof ready . a recorded fone convo with enough evidence will do . save the file in a pc or a memory card to have it safe if someone forcefully delete it from fone . report to the management and police ; together . dont leave the moron from this ; he should not do this to another girl .
 agree ; if you really want to complain ; do it now . if u do n't ; wait for another kiss or hug heheheeh
 how to report my bos ? how to report my bos ; he be offer me indecent proposal . i tell him many time that i have already a bf here . i 'm afraid he might terminate me from my work . please help .
 i have this feeling that you like what he do to you . because in the first place ; you do not even make any action when he kiss you on the neck . jeeezzz ...
 get some proof then talk to your bos that you felt your be harass so he should stop . if he do n't change for about a week then go ahead and report him at least you try to warn him .
 pcgeek ; that 's exactly what i say earlier ...
 u let him kiss un in the neck ... .damn
 or maybe she be shock at what happen ; let 's hope it 's for that reason ... but i hope if he ever try again ; that she get the courage to stand up for herself and do something ... for her own sake..
 if possible change your job .
 just get your soccer shoe on and kick his both ball and get your name in world record list for kick 2 ball at a time .
 it simple ; dont be a dumb ! do what be the best to catch this guy .
 hit directly his forehead then sign ur name ! hahahahahaha ! is there any company here sell teargas ? ? ?
 you tell an arab guy you have a `` boyfriend '' ? you seem to be too new here ... you have to tell them `` married '' and not shag with `` boyfriend-s '' ...
 how to report my bos ? how to report my bos ; he be offer me indecent proposal . i tell him many time that i have already a bf here . i 'm afraid he might terminate me from my work . please help .
 cherry listen do this and think about it ... your bos be lebaness so the high bos be qatari ; dont worry to lose your job because he be only a gm there but he be not your sponsor ; the qatari be the one who will kick him out of the office.. if you not scar now.. this be the step.. before enter your bos office take your mobile with u and start record something.. if u can do video more solid evidence and voice record be good also but u need or conversation be involve about harrasing to u ; do u get what i mean . if you get that go to the police ... or use that evidence to scare him away ... and dont smile on him dont give him anything to deserve your kindness.. trust me on this ... because we be the same on this kind of situation ... in this country u need to be strong and smart specially to u girls..
 ..tell your bf about your problem ; maybe he can help you also .
 ahihi ... '' boyfriend-s ''
 is it so common in qatar that woman be victim of these kind of wanker and have to ask people what to do because they assume there be no justice for woman here ? anywhere else i think this would be a give : report him to his superior and the police .
 if you think you be weak ! i 'm not be biotchy but : - < b > to cherry23 < /b > : your company have an hr officer ; right ? why not discuss this with them ... to give it appropriate action . secondly ; if you gon na complain to the police ; you good stand firm with your complaint ... a this would be a long ; tedious ; messy situation wherein your work will get jeopardize in the process . they ould easily turn the table on you ; you be new in the job ; in the company . it ' ; ; be your word against your manager . third ; maybe your manager misread your action towards him . you be amiable to him and friendly may have be read/understood that you like him ... maybe you should do a self-assessment . fourth ; if you really want to keep your job and the sexual harrassment to stop ... tell him frankly . he 's educate enough to take the point . he may do something stupid for be reject but as long a you do your job well ; he ca n't have anything to use against you to terminate you . from what you 're post about the situation be `` complicate '' ... it 's not . you want the money for the overtime he 's give you ... but you do n't like the attention ... then speak out your thoughts and tell him that you came here to work and earn ... not to do any tomfoolery ... . i hope you get my point ... .and do n't be so naive .
 tinkerbell10 - i just hope you be right . but at least she should have move away from that pervert and not let him kiss her . because this guy can say `` ohh.. she be not resist ; i can do what i want '' .
 cherry something be not right here ... you say that lately he have start kiss your neck ... hello - but how do he get that close to kiss you on your neck ? ? it not an easy thing to do so he have to be pretty close and comfortable to be able to do that and what about you ? ? you just stand there quietly while he do it . i know one thing ; if any guy come that close to me i would certainly notice and move away ... so i tend to think there be more to the story.. maybe you be nice and cosy with the guy and now that he want more you be panic ... and to tell him you have a bf well thats just real clever ... sorry i dont buy your story - there be something else you be not tell u ... .
 and another thing ... i be sure your office/company have a complaint policy or greivance policy ... why go to police and make it into some great big story of he know this and that person ... . simple answer - report to your hr department or to his bos and get it over and do with ... . like i say before - big story for nothing and there be something you have not tell u which be basically that you would rather have the money etc then complain about him . where be your pride ! ! ! !
 if you be really interested in get this guy off your back ; draw the line in stone ; not sand . most guy do understand when a woman reply with a firm `` no '' ; and they usually back off . it 's when you keep move the line that they start play around . so be strong and say `` no ; thankyou ; not interested '' . you have to decide what be more important to you ; a few measly extra buck or your self respect and dignity .
 jack quite honestly tell a guy to back off by tell him your married do n't work too lol if a man want you nothing can keep him away and if a man doesnt want you nothing can make him stay .

 great ! thanks cherukkan and marycatherine . good to know i 'll be in good company and wo n't starve ! pollyj there be lot of great reason to be vegan : animal right ; health ; low environmental impact and peace of mind to name a few . i feel much healthy since become vegan . i have more energy ; i do n't get a tired after eat meal ; i lose weight and i 'm happy know my action be inline with my thought and ethic . of course ; everyone be different and for some people ( like boer ) it harder to give up the thing they 've always love . for me it be a great choice and i 've never look back . give it a go ! i promise it 's not as hard a you think !
 you wouldnt have a problem be vegan in doha ; besides lack the daiya cheese that i love so much . check out some indian restaurant around !

 hahaha eddy ; $ 700 would be enought for you to spend 2 day in doha ..lol
 i would not advise come here without a job or someone to stay with . finding a job be hard work and can take some time . doha be expensive and you will not last more than 2 week on us $ 700 . it be best to save the airfare and try apply for job first..
 its good you save or invest your money into a business .
 just 2 spend ur money in 2 days max .

 yup ... it new ... . very good sitting ...
 you must have log on to that qatarhub website someone be promote here yesterday ... .
 go to markhya 's burger king ... around it you will find a shop call `` anime world '' ... theres also one in gharrafa 's mobile market ... .
 the best way i 'd say be to buy it online ; there be a ton of website that sell anime and manga .
 jarir bookstore have a decent collection . i have a few book ; may be you could collect them from me
 m a huge anime fan along with my friend we search everywhere for anime and manga and to say the least there isint many in doha but here be some location i suggest : - anime : video saqr stores - city center - landmark - markhiya etc . virigin megastore - villagio ( the only one with anime ) anime wonderland - gharafa ( its probably close now ) - manga : al rawnaq - markhiya = thats all the place i know off . i seriously suggest you order it from online or you can go to dubai mall in dubai it have a huge 15 ft long bookshelf of manga . = )
 do they sell manga comic book or anime anywhere ? i like to read manga ( in english ) and watch anime but i do n't like do it online and would rather buy it . do they sell it anywhere in qatar ? what be the shop names ? the saqr and virgin stores sell a very limited amount of anime and no manga at all ( i do find one manga but it be in french ) thanks .
 there be a bookstore that sell manga book ( naruto ; naruto shippuden ; hunter x hunter ; vampire knight and more ) it 's in qatar university and student center in qatar foundation .
 gold be the same price the world around . the only difference be the `` making charge '' and tax for some country such a egypt . dubai probably have the least extra price on top of the gold 's value for that day . if you do n't know the day 's price for ; say ; 22k gold ; do n't try to buy some . the merchant will have you figure out in a flash . mandi
 same price but the desgins be totally different from any be else
 i find three item here in qatar be cheap than in india 1 . petrol 2 . saffron 3 . dates ( but you have to collect it from the road side palm tree )
 i think you hear it wrong from somebody ; compare to saudi and dubai ; all the stuff be much costly here . so ; think twice before you pick something from qatar . yeah ; you will get pure gold from any gcc country than india . happy shopping ! ! ! ! .
 in qatar gold price be cheap compare than india ; but make charge be high . so final comparsion qatar rate be high than india exampletoday rate in india u can have 1 gm ( 22ct ) 1250 ; but qatar 1 gm ( 22ct ) 100qr ( inclulde make charge ) = 1310 .
 andrew be practical man . he be correct
 ksrsiva ... also include the exchange rate fluctuation ... the thing cheape here in qataar be : 1 . petrol 2 . cars 3 . ok ... you dont have to pay for date . i mean the fruit !
 i think politicians our bad then our army ... be it marshal law or democratic government ; corruption be every where ; but then again why do more then 75 % of pakistanis support the army ... . egypt never have revolution in the first place ; face be change but until now egyptian army be calling the shots..
 hey idiot ;
 will egypt turn into pakistan ? after the hard fought gain of the revolution it seem the prize of the egyptians might be for them to mirror event in pakistan . an army that be always involve in the politics ; corruption from all side and frequently change government . no country can prosper and move forward without stability and with the army interfere once more in politics do the next decade for egypt look like the last decade for pakistan ?
 indeed brit ; but in pakistan supreme court be take thing in to their hand ... just like the disqualification of pm of pakistan yesterday ...
 oh dear the election result have now be suspend pending an investigation ... .
 moza : change do not come from a vote until after the civil war have begin ; be fight and one side have win ; then the vote mean something .
 yes either shaffalah or the learning centre ; both part of qatar foundation . aisha-taweela
 check with shaffalah and the learning centre a note above ; but you may not find the same type of program you be accustom to in north america - not say they 're bad or anything ; but different . conditions like down 's syndrome exist here a they do everywhere in the world - however ; often child be not see - what i mean be ; they 're often keep at home ; where they will be safe but exposure to the outside world be limit . not all parent do this of course ; but whereas in north america i 'm never surprise to see someone with a disability ( whether physical ; mental ; or congenital ) at the mall or the grocery store or the movie - it 's unusual enough here for me to `` notice '' them on a conscious level . this be merely an fyi in term of adjust to the local `` culture '' on this issue ; another point be that many people from the subcontinent `` stare '' at people and thing they consider to be different ( hey ; i 'm one of them when i go out for a walk with the dog ; i try to look at it a i 'm a form of entertainment - half of the dog and pony show so to speak ) it can be disconcert especially when you first arrive . i 'm sure you and your family would be able to get along fine and i hope the program on offer at these organization will be useful . signature line > `` you ca n't fix stupid ''
 do n't even think about it . you might be able to get a place in a mainstream school provide you pay for a special need assistant ( untrained ) for your son . do n't come .
 compass take special need . i know of at least one family who have a down 's child there ; although i have no idea of the severity . i would contact them to see if they can help otherwise ; a others have say ; i would n't come to doha .

 al jazeera world cup card does anyone know where you can buy the world cup subscription card from ?
 there be a stall next to paul 's in villaggio and another stall next to next in the mall . both sell the card .
 if you go down to the sofitel hotel building ; around it you will find a lot of electronic and accessory shop in that area ; just walk into one and ask for the cards .
 on the top floor of city centre . opposite end to the cinema . its a mobile phone shop i think but theresa aj sticker on the window . its expensive though . qr 365 for the world cup package and another qr 270 for 12 month subscription for all the channel . i have hear mozaic be offer a package but when i phone to enquire they operator say they can not reach an agreement with aj . that might change tho . ive pay because i dont want to miss it ...
 i just get 2 month al jazeera to get the world cup and an extra month for 293 . for who only want the world cup this be the ideal deal : ) ( it be in villaggio in the little stall next to paul 's )

 visit the pharmacy and ask ; some be open to 'persuasive ' argument
 medicines trying to find out if a particular medicine be available over the counter . is there a website which list the medicine available here ?
 cocaine and herion you can not buy from pharmacies here ; i think you need to try the black market .
 herion ?
 certainly it be not over the counter ; but you could visit the near health center and get a prescription for it .
 thank you segmund

 eid 29 or 30 ? ? hey guy swould it be eid tommorow or day after tommorow whats ur guess ? ?
 if it on friday we could calm down and do our every chore easily but if it tommorow then everything will be in a rush ... barber..food items..shopping etc ...
 only allaah know ! ! !
 i will turn religious for today and pray that it 's on friday.. pleaseeee
 we 'll just have to wait.. insha allah.. it will be on friday.. i do n't want ramadan to end so soon : (
 to begin with ; al in arabic mean the and ilaah mean god . in arabic the denite article the be a part of the word and be not a separate part of it a in english ; so when put the two word together al and ilaah we get the word allah or allaah which mean the god . the i ; the rst letter of ilaah have be omit to facilitate the pronunciation . note that the l in allaah be a dark one . now you must be wonder ; what be the difference between the word allaah and allah ; it simply a matter of spell ; the spelling allah be more common ; but in i-mag we adopt the spell allaah a it represent the true pronunciation of the word in standard arabic . it be note worthy that there be two pronunciation of the word ; one be a colloquial one to which the spelling allah might be more suitable ; and a standard and more correct pronunciation that the spell allaah best represent .
 eid can either b on thursday or friday ; coz hijri month hav only 29 or 30 day ...
 eid be confirm on friday ; coz last two month rajab & shaban be of 29 day ; a per islamic calendar ...
 no saeed bahi ; still sourceless ; but three consecutive month cant be of 30 day ... & everybody in doubt for eid to be on friday ... : )
 eid be on friday it be confirm ; but dont ask for source ;
 relax ; just enjoy iftaar and wait for official call
 eid 29 or 30 ? ? hey guy swould it be eid tommorow or day after tommorow whats ur guess ? ?
 hope i could ; i be eager to eat hyderabadi dish ;
 i be stick up with some work ; if i finish early inshallah i will but chance be only 5 %
 thanks saeed ; eid mubarak to you too and everyone who celebrate .
 eid will be on friday insha allah.it have een announce on qatar tv .
 eid mubarak to all of u . . . . ! ! ! 30
 i know how to..
 yes be look for a male masseur ... . anyone know how to locate or contact them in qatar ?
 i be a filipino ... .how much if ever ?
 i understand you will not have a residency permit ... rp that be ... without that you cant open a bank account ... the only way you can buy a used or a brand new car be to pay for it in cash since you wont be able to get a bank loan for that good luck
 if you do get a residency permit ; then you can open a bank account . if you 're goingto need an auto loan ; the bank will only loan you money if your company or sponsor be on the `` approved list '' . if you 're not on their approved list ; you 're not out of luck because mashreq bank and al khaliji bank will loan you money even if you 're not on the list . this be assume you have a very good salary and some documentation to prove it . good luck !
 can i buy a car instead of rent ? hello everybody ; i will come to work in qatar for 1 year next month . i get a visit visa - one entry for one month and my company will renew it every month . so my question be : can i buy a used car instead of rent ? thank you in advance
 but will he even be able to get a driver 's license without the rp ? from what i understand you can drive for a week or two with some country ' driver ' license but not longer . so he would n't be able to either rent or buy ( register ) the car . also ; it 's illegal to work on a visit visa be n't it ? subject to arrest and deportation if catch ?
 i have a friend that be try to do the same a you . renting be expensive and if you buy a decent secondhand car you will have something to sell at the end of 12 month . my friend be here for 2 or 3 week every month and have be use a driver or rent a jeep at approximatley 5000-6000 qatar rials per month . i think you will need to get an international license or a short term qatar license every time you renew you visa . i think about 200 rials but not sure the problem be ownership of the car ; you will need to register the car and also get insurance . i be not sure about these detail . please if you find out any helpful detail please contact me 6730727
 i hope this do n't end up be a duplicate because i do n't yet see the 2nd answer i just submit . anyway ; first of all ; a car rental agency will rent you a car if you do n't have a qatari dl . however ; you will not be cover under any insurance umbrella . meaning ; if you get into an accident you 're 100 % responsible for all repair to the car up to the full prie of the car ( unless it 's deem the other driver fault ) . yes ; it 's technically illegal to work on a tourist or visit visa ; but some company will let you slide if you 're in the process of apply for an rp . you wo n't be able to buy and register a vehicle without an rp if you 're try for a bank loan . you wo n't even be able to open an account . bank wo n't lend money to anyone unless yuo 're on their `` approve list '' . however ; mashreq bank and al khaliji will give you a loan if yuo 're not on the list provide you have a good income and can put 10 % down . even if you pay cash ; i do n't think you can register or insure a new/used car without an rp .
 i understand your position very well ; but remember you can not process anything without a residence permit ( rp ) . when i say anything i mean it - bank account ; driver 's licence ; vehicle registration ; etc . talk to your company and try to get a work permit and then an rp . failing which ask the company for an allowance for a regular taxi . there be many individual provide personal taxi service - although there be measure to ban this practice . once again remember without an rp you can not process anything in qatar . and if you meet with an accident while drive without an rp the police ot the other party will simply put the blame on you .
 why do n't you request then with your company to provide you one ... otherwise i would suggest that you should rent to avoid problem in future .
 yes u can buy by cheap price i have a car i want to sell it now it 's maxima nissan 98 model u can come and see if u want call me 5173177
 try use car it be a best way
 i 'll try opera too ... ... life would become dull if there be no such difficulties ...

 teyseer be well they have a special section where they do internal cleaning .

 as far a i know ultrasound be not harmful a they use sound wave to see the baby and not radiation . my wife have one with almost every visit ( we be in doha ) but not every two week . but at least every month ; some month more because we go to get second opinion .
 i be follow up with hamad hospital for 3 month and i be almost 21 week . usually they do the ultra sound once a month until the 32 -34 week when they start to do it every 2 week in order to make sure the mother and baby be healthy and know when the labor will start . i have ask that question and they ultra sound technician say that ; if the pregnant lady do the ultra sound over 25 time during her first trimester it will be harmful for the baby . because the first trimester be when the development of the baby and his/her organ be develop . by the end of second trimester to the end of the third be only gain of weight and size . hope this help www.bastook.com
 no ; at diagnostic level that too at late period of pregnancy it be safe.it be well to follow hamad hosp suggestion
 there be no harm in do frequent ultra sound test
 is ultrasound sonography be harmful for the baby ? my wife be 38 week pregnent and have be go to hamad hospital since last 3 months.in hamad hospital doctor recommend an ultrasound after every 2 weeks.can any one tell me that be it harmful for the baby ? in india generally doctor do not prefer this much frequent ultrasound checkups.please suggest and share your experience .
 u say she be in her 38 month so she be about to have the baby any time now .so it it be normal to check on the baby freqently.nothing wrong with that .
 thanks to all of you.your answer have really make me feel well because this be our first baby and i be a little worried about that . once again thank a lot ... ... ..
 the less frequent the good . i have ultrasound every 2 week in my 1st trimester when i be expect my young son . it be not recommended but i have a complicated pregnancy that be why . my son now 3 ; 5 year old ; healthy and happy .. thank god . eventhough i have the same worry you have . so ; have a wonderfull parenthood .
 i have ultrasound do every month when i be pregnant ( that be during the time when i go to private clinic ) then i switch to hamad hospital and i have three more in the last trimester of pregnancy.no complication just to make sure everything be ok with my baby .
 at the begining stage of preganancy you have to go for ultrasound each and every ( 03 ) month ; to make sure your baby be healthy and safe ; if any complecation occur find by the doctor ; they recommend for frequent ultrasound which be necessary ... .. - naeem -

 gps navigation do any of you use a gps to get around in qatar ? if so ; do it help or hurt more ? i be think of upload the garmin middle east map but one person tell me it 's irrelevant since street be re-routed there often . just think a navigator would make get around a little easy when we first start drive but i do n't want to blow $ 120 on something useless either .
 no need waste your money for specific gps unit ; all you need be just a mobile phone with gps capability . install it with garmin for mobile and complete the map of the area you need . or just use google map if you do n't want get headache of renewal the map . im use gps only to know where my position be and then figure out the fast route because you know how often re-routing happen here in doha .
 happyhorizon ... too lazy ? ? ? too tech savvy ? ? ? ? ? or just too much money ? ? ? : - ) . no offence intend . agree with darude . friday morning be best to drive around in doha . most people do not get out of their home until after lunch . the best way be to just drive around in square . u will eventually reach your start point . and yes ; road work never end in doha . welcome and safe driving
 who tell you that rp be must for gps . just take pp copy go to qtel or vodafone get the connection and buy phone from them simple
 it 's worth buy a gps ; though i never use it in qatar..but it be really essential at ksa . i be really use it a lot to get around in ksa .
 edifis i agree with you.. i buy a garmin nuvi some 5 month back ; and it be soo handy and fun to use.. i simply love it ... . : )
 fa can you tell me from where to download map of turkey and eastern europe to the navigator ?
 use navigon ... it perfect solution for gps in qatar and around gulf use iphone
 now many of the nokia model have free navigation and it really useful . you can even get the satellite view just like google map .
 i 've get the garmin late 3d edition . it almst perfect . i buy it for my car trip to dubai and it be very helpful show all hotel ; restaurant ; landmark ; hospital ...

 change school to mix with child that know good ?
 tell him the truth . israel kill baby and civilian . the whole world know it .
 mom ; do you know israel ? my 8-yr. old son go up to me and ask `` mom ; do you know israel ? '' i say yes and ask him why 'd you ask ... he answer and say `` my classmate say that israel kill the baby in lebanon . '' as a parent ; how will you handle this ? i know israel be a big and delicate issue in middle east ...
 my son be play with some neighborhood kid and they have say to him that israeli plane be go to drop bomb on everyone and that they kill people when they find them ... get him really wind up and scar . so i explain to him that the other kid be muslim ; and they they believe certain thing that we do n't necessarily believe in . they do n't they do n't eat pork ; we do ; we believe in santa ; they do n't ; etc . i then go on to explain about how some country fight and go to war with one another and people get hurt and kill and it 's never nice ; but it happen . and hopefully soldier try to be as careful a they can ; but sometimes woman and kid and old people and animal get hurt and kill by accident . it 's sad but it happen . and then i explain that some of our best family friend be jewish and/or israelis ; and i ask if he know that ( no ; he do n't ) ; and then i say that i do n't think that our friend be bad people at all ( he agree ) ; and so i do n't think it be fair for people to say that all israelis be bad . that there be good and bad people everywhere ; all over the world . he kind of get the idea ... but it is tough raise kid here ... and i know i be go to have to constantly fight this battle ; because he will hear it from kid every single year -- on the playground ; in class ; everywhere . btw ; we have to do this song-and-dance on another controversial issue : homosexuality . my son come home one day and announce that when a man love another man and get marry to him ; it 's `` haram '' ( lol -- he do n't even know what that word meant ! ) . so off i go on my soapbox ; try to explain to him my point of view that there be nothing wrong with any two adult who love one another ... and that when he grow up ; he can decide for himself what he think be right and wrong about a lot of thing . and that in the meantime ; he will hear a lot of different idea ; but that do n't necessarily make any of them correct or mean that he have to agree with them ; even with idea that i subscribe to . whew ! it 's tough be a parent ! !
 would n't that be bias ?
 but i do like the way umm handle it . i have a friend ; she be from england her husband from lebanon . her son when it be come up to national day tell her that in no way be he go to have anything to do with lebanon because his friend do not like arabs . this boys go to one of the 'supposed ' best school in doha . i tell my friend ; that if that be my kid ; they would have go to school with a cedar strap to their hand ; some lebanese food and union jack underpants . my thought be my own ; but i doubt my mum would agree with some of them .
 that be nice ... i admire you that you have show your son the two other side of the coin ... yes ; it 's really tough raise our kid here..
 thats wonderful because a young child 's mind need to be mould into a proper one and the circumstance and environment he live in be a major factor in that . i would make sure that he remain as neutral a possible and when he grow up ; then he can take side
 i think i might try to defuse the specific of the question and focus on `` what be war . '' explain why war be wrong and use the example of child be kill a a reason why we must all work to bring about peace . that way you do n't have to take side in a we/they ; israel/lebanon discussion at this point . mandi
 totally agree with you mandi ... it 's a sensitive issue
 grandkruizer i assume you forget to add that practically every country ; race or religion in the world have a history of do exactly the same thing ; some still be
 be when the teacher at school be the one try to spout their propaganda to the child .
 kid will be kid ; but it grow up 's who need to be more responsible . my daughter go to one of the lead international school in doha ; where muslim child be in minority . when she tell her friends about her trip to saudi arab in spring break ; one of the kid tell her not to go because the ppl be bad there . she take the matter to the teacher and he confirm it for her by say yes there be bad ppl in saudi . now a a teacher ; it beat me how he could be so irresponsible . a grown up should not fee these hate thought to child . so i have to explain me 7 yr old how there be good and bad in every part of the world ; and every religion ; we just avoid bad one and stick with good one . i think raise child in mulsim country will be eaiser for me ; but i guess raise kid be not easy no matter where you be .
 mom ; do you know israel ? my 8-yr. old son go up to me and ask `` mom ; do you know israel ? '' i say yes and ask him why 'd you ask ... he answer and say `` my classmate say that israel kill the baby in lebanon . '' as a parent ; how will you handle this ? i know israel be a big and delicate issue in middle east ...
 i 'd explain both sides- and that neither be right . it 's an opportunity to help teach him possibly about how to draw his own conclusion ; when present with all side of an issue . i remember vividly my parent do the same with me when it come to nuclear weapon ( i be the only five year old who could tell you what hiroshima be and why it be bad- hippy parent ) ; the situation in rwanda in 1994 ; apartheid ; etc etc . the fact be this country does have a huge slant ; and i think it 's important for anyone ; kid or adult ; to think critically about thing .
 also ; it might be a good time to explain judaism anyway- it 's purim season and that 's a fun jewish holiday : ) i mean ; you ca n't avoid learn about islam here ; may as well slot in the other religion too !

 i take my hat off to you umm !
 while agree in totality with your first post tell him when there be a war ; everybody kill everybody . tell him the war be bad ! tell him everyone should live in peace i disagree with the second one . when there be a war people be kill . the bullet fire do not take care that victim belongs to which religion . i cant stress more . but let me tell you that i believe in take consideration of root problem rather than just consequence thereof . zionist israel be responsible for the present crisis thats all ! and if you kill someone expect same reaction from other end .
 advocate when you be at school do you ever have to do a debate on a subject you do n't like ? i think it be good if school do this a it force you to look at other people value ; and just because you think they be silly ; etc they be still their value and how you can more effectively have a dialogue .
 truth shall remain a truth ... ... . you have to realize pain and agony of your fellow brother and sister . boycott israel- the sponsor of terrorism
 base ; you could simply explain that there be bad people in the world everywhere ; not only in israel . ( for parent ; i think ; this be perhaps the sad realization you could get -- that your child will be grow up in a world so screwed and f up that human be treat like s*t in some part of the world ) truly sad indeed . btw ; base make sure you know the school of your child and it environment . it would help if you place here in a tolerant environment . mo lang !
 you have to tell your kid : never never blame the people and the country . the war - it 's political issue and government responsibility . jewish people be kind ; religious and the most educated people in the world . they do n't kill baby . the government do . one government provokes ; the other reply . never never teach you kid to hate just people ! ! ! jewish ; lebanese ; palestinians ; americans baby be cute and sweet and all jewish ; lebanese ; palestinians ; americans mother and father love their child ! ! !
 i would follow umm jake 's path ; but also explain that israel produce creature like tzipeee . ( swooooooooooon )
 mom ; do you know israel ? my 8-yr. old son go up to me and ask `` mom ; do you know israel ?

'' as a parent ; how will you handle this ? i know israel be a big and delicate issue in middle east ...
 tell your son ; just focus on his study .
 i enjoy read this thread ; the grand majority point at israel a the big bad wolf . the problem you get ; be too many personification . all dress a sheep ; the inside of those dress of sheep ; they be just deceive and nasty werewolf . < img src= '' http : //logo.cafepress.com/8/2817834.5660348.jpg '' > if god drop acid ; would he see people ? -- george carlin
 israel is a terrorist regime
 i think that politician on both side be responsible for civilian victim on both side . i ca n't deceive myself and others by blame israel only because i be a muslim or an arab
 ummjake ; i be really surprise by your argument try to explain to your son thing that he know good than you . while i would pass on the israeli v arab ( muslim ) issue because it be contravertial ; and i do n't want to be biase ; i be stun by your answers/arguments about gays . your son have the correct info ; and i be certain you know that as well . just your freek education and be politically correct prevent you from say the truth . if you be a christian or a jewsih ; you know that the bible or old testement do not approve of this . if you do n't have a religion ; you know that human nature do reject such a relationship . your kid be be tought the correct thing at school ; while you be manipulate them ... .
 why do it bother you ( or anyone else really ) what two consent adult choose to do with their private romantic/sexual life ? they 're not ask you to join in . just be happy they have find someone to love and care for . and human nature do not reject such a relationship . statistics show that 10 % of the population be homosexual . there 's even evidence of homosexuality be the norm in some part of the animal kingdom . do your homework ... my kid be n't be teach this in school . trust me . if he be ; i would yank him out of there so fast your head would spin . he 's hear about it from the other kid in the neighborhood ; who hear it from their parent ; who subscribe to that notion because their religion dictate it and that 's what they 've be bring up on . if that lifestyle be not for you ; then do n't follow it . simple enough . let everyone make their own choice about what work for them . think you can handle that ?
 first ; thank you for take the debate with a good spirit . by the way ; currently ; i live in us ; and probably move to qatar inthe next 2-months or so . the two of u and the lady who start this thread be go through the same thing in a different spirit . while i be try to move to qatar to protect my kid form the type of education and tolerance the west promot ( and obviously you do as well ) ; you be try to protect your kid from the good moral that the society in qa breatch . i be an educated person with a phd degree ; and very open to tolerate many issue ; but nothing againist the human nature or the order of god . while i be so accomodating to avoid the debate about israel ( i be an arab by the way ) ; i would not tolerate the gays lesbian issue . good create u to multiply ; otherwise ; if two men get marry and two woman get marry ; and the human raise will disappear . it be immoral issue ; and disgust behaviour . it be not a matter of why i be bother by this ; it be a matter of moral and religion belive . the three main relgion do disapprove of this . you know the story of the people of prophet loat ( sp ! ) ; how good punish them . the story be mention in the three holy book . i would certainly argue againist the animal kingdoom ? i have never read ; hear ; or see that animal do practice this . males animal always fight for feamales . any culture and society have positive and negative ; and the smart person who try to improve on his quality . i have be in na for 18 year ; and pick up many of the good quality that be hear ; such a education ; work ethic ; honesty ; dedication ; tolearnce ; objectivity ; be profissional in all aspect of your life ; time keep ; etc . i hope you can be prave enough ; and pick on some of the good ethic and moral down there in qatar ; beside the money ... .
 you 'll probably encounter gay in doha more than any other place .
 well express ; ummjake . if my son come home spout stuff about homosexuality be 'haram ' i would certainly object to it strongly too . the fact of homosexuality be find in the animal kingdom be indeed well document . there be case of 'gay ' animal be find in some colony . it be ( humourously ) call the 'science that dare not speak it name ' . i do recall an interesting documentary on showtime ( the arab world satellite network ) about this not long ago . what this fact of nature indicate that it be not the 'unnatural ' behaviour moralist have always claim it to be ; since give a free reign ; even animal engage in it naturally . human - and animal - sexuality be so much more complex than just the 'man and woman.. they make baby ' narrative which religionist be have be use for century . and homosexuality be condemn in the christianity and judaism ? hmm ; you may want to check your fact on that one . sure ; the vatican do n't like it ; but there be a lot of scholarship to explain why the anti-gay interpretation gain traction over history - gain traction until it be consider a `` fact '' - but be ; in fact ; not correct . understanding the nature of religion a a way of leverage power over others really help to explain why we follow it ritual and idea with such dedication ; even fly in the face of logic ; science ; or reason . -- -- -- -- -- -- - `` let 's slip out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini '' mae west

 although i respect ummjack opinion . but i would never teach my son to accept gay . i 'll never teach him either to fear or reject them . it 's up to him to determine it himself . both my parent share `` arab nationalist '' ideology.yet ; i 've never be teach to hate jew .
 i always ; always say there be good and bad in every race ; religion and country . respect have to be give to all . i be very old fashion ; my boy always stand up when any lady enter the room . they hold door open for both men and woman ; simply because that show respect and good manner to an adult . if an adult be rude to them after they have show them respect ; all i say be ; they could have be have a bad day ( whilst fume ) . my thought be my own ; but i doubt my mum would agree with some of them .
 an article you may find informative . written by the same journalist who so vehemently argue against the recent attempt to ban criticism of religion in the un ; i only mention this a it further point out that nothing should be free from scrutiny and criticism - otherwise the carnage in gaza could also be suppress . http : //www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-dupes-no-we-were-telling-the-truth-1649528.html < span style= '' font-style : italic '' > '' deaths in the bible . god - 2 ; 270 ; 365 not include the victim of noah 's flood ; sodom and gomorrah ; or the many plague ; famine ; fiery serpent ; etc because no specific number be give . satan - 10 . `` < /span

 i too agree that what read in the press or see on the 'news ' have to be take with a pinch of salt . however ; how do people learn ? i admit that people be travel more and so they see for themselves but we have to read and then debate and then make our own conclusion . my thought be my own ; but i doubt my mum would agree with some of them .
 thanks all for a high quality debate . i think we can both learn from hear the other side . i want to take up for the israel argument from the perspective of another arab ( in this case palestinian ) who have live over half his life in the us and england . its true that in the middle east there be a culture of black and white . however ; in the west ; there be a culture of gray . in other word ; there be a tendency to say both side be at fault and there be no hard fact and no right and wrong . sometimes this be true ; but in my opinion often it allow one to have a lazy psuedo-intellectual opinion about a subject they know very little about . it take knowledge to take a ( fair ) stand . there be little remain grayness in the israel palestine issue . this be a situation where one people come and displace another ; and continue to abuse them for over 50 year . israeli historian and most israeli intellectual agree with these fact . look up benny morris and the new historian in israel for the modern scholarly israeli narrative for what happen in palestine . its not pretty . israel be in defiance of nearly 100 un resolution ; relate both to their land grab and human right record . the close analogy be the displacement of the native indian in north america -- i be sure it would sound shock if you try to assign them some of the blame for the genocide they experience . the other side try to feebly resist ; but be subject to an overwhelming opression and injustice ; the close anology to the current situation on the ground be aparthide in south africa . nowadays ; the arab country have make remarkable compromise articulate in the saudi initiative more than 5 year ago . they be agree to complete normalization with israel ; in exchange for the west bank ( 21 % of the area of the historical palestine which have less than 5 % jews 100 year ago ) . however ; israeli right wing ; with the support of the israeli lobby the us ( aipac and jdl and their crony ) insist on no compromise . meanwhile ; over 2 million palestinians continue to live in subhuman condition and the world continue to find `` both side at blame '' because they will not agree to it . we live in strange time . i hope that you would instead encourage your kid to read and figure out the fact ; isnt that a great lesson ? i be a strong believer that with justice ; come peace ; and the festering wound that generate hate be dry up . i also sincerely hope that you invest a little more energy into learn about the middle east geo-political issue before assume that you know about it than the people live it do .
 it 's not about the conflict.. the question be : how to handle the question of 8 years-old boy about `` israelians kill lebanese baby '' . you suggest stud israelian-palestin conflict and figure out who be 'good ' and who be 'bad ' ; which consequentially lead to accept one side and judging another ; which eventually lead to the stir up the hatred . but thats not what the child need . not to find out who be right and who be wrong ; not to argue anymore when ; who ; and why ? child need to be explain that any killing be bad ; any war be wrong . child doesnt need to understand why one kill another . child have to learn : any killing shouldnt be accept in the civil world . i hope you can see the difference . < i > < b > ********************* you become responsible forever for what you have tame . antoine de saint-exupry < /b > < /i > < img src= '' http : //cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif '' >
 i completely agree and see the difference . i be not offer any advice about how to handle the situation of the original poster . i struggle with these issue with my own son ; who be 5 and 3 . i be attempt to generate an adult discussion similar to the one above on homosexuality . cheers .
 not tell their kid something they believe be true `` because it have not be well-researched '' ? ( and who be decide whether something be well-researched or not ? ) nobody would do that . i think the most open-minded of parent might try to explain both side and then tell their kid that a they grow up and learn more ; they will make up their own mind ; but we will almost always explain what we believe be true ... .because when you believe something yourself ; you generally think that you be right . that 's just human nature . i seriously doubt that the religious among u would tell their kid `` well ; mommy and i believe in one god ; and that he create the heaven and the earth . but that 's just u . you should read up on the subject and find out what make sense to you . '' lol ! but would n't it be fun if they do ?
 kudos to you for teach your child that what be taught and say in school be n't the gospel truth ! children be confuse enough a it be in life without be teach that certain nationality ; race ; religion ; sexual orientation ; be the devil incarnate . children 's mind be like blank blackboard ... they also absorb thing like sponge . why teach them hatred against others at such a young impressionable age when all they want to do be be friend with the next child ; irregardless of who or where they be from ? life be difficult enough to deal with ; without presetting young mind upon a destructive path . if you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous ; he will not bite you ; that be the main difference between a dog and man . -mark twain-

 if i be from the usa then i should have the same opinion a you ? i say clearly i be a palestinian who have live in the us over half his life . i be a us citizen . i be a long term lurker on qatarliving who register to contribute to this conversation . i be a professor in a us university on sabbatical leave for the year in qatar -- what do this have to do with anything ; anyways ? my response be intend to generate adult conversation . the crux of my argument be that many expat here do not understand the geopolitical situation in israel/palestine and assume instead that people here be irrational for have the opinion that they do about israel . a peaceful and just resolution to the problem there be the only way to stop the hate ; that start with understand the fact on the ground ; instead of have the pc opinion that there be no fact and everyone there be equally to blame . my response be not intend in any way to be something you say to your kid -- poor choice of thread on my part .
 i completely agree with your sentiment and respect the way you be raise your kid . i apologize if my response come across a if i be be critical of you . i like the emphasis on grow up and learn more for issue that be too complex for them to handle ; i will use that line with my own kid if you dont mind . peace ( and justice ! )
 and have no problem with your nationality ; heritage or where you choose to live or work . i agree -- a lot of these issue present wonderful teaching moment if you 've get kid . but a parent we have to view them a such and be mindful of what we say ; how we say it ; and whether our action match our word ... as robert fulghum say ; `` do n't worry that child never listen to you ; worry that they be always watch you . ''
 okabbar ; welcome to doha if indeed you decide to come . there be a lot of benefit to raise child here ; especially kid from north america who have tend to see themselves a the center of the known universe ! but one caveat for you ; i have know many parent with fine moral fiber get the shock of their life when they tumble to the fact that their kid be mistreat their maid ; shopkeeper or other laborer whom they happen to come in contact with . i 'm not say everyone and i know that every parent say not my kid ; but i 've know a lot of surprised and dismayed parent . mandi
 be still only a child ; let him play ; he will know the war only when it be big and you will see that the two party be no different ... . for hatred ; there be always a time ... .
 http : //yadiin.blogspot.com/ sin be sin . you can call oppose sin politically incorrect - or propaganda . unfortunately these kid be kill by the israeli war machine .and it be not over .most probably another one will be kill . as a parent how you not feel that something be wrong with israel 's policy ? check out these : http : //www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle http : //gazaholocaust.com/category/latest-news/ about the jews : some of them be really cool ! you can read their name here : http : //www.ajjp.org/campaigns/signstatement.php ? cid=15
 thanks for the greeting . i do n't know how much you know about canada and it culture and education . canada and canadian system be one of a kind when it come to social integration ; respect others ; and peaceful interaction . to make the story short ; i have three boy ( 10 ; 7 ; and 2 ) ; and they be so respectable to others and so peaceful . to a a degree ; where i be a bit annoyed about it . i be struggle to teach my kid to be aggressive when there be a need for it . they always resort to peaceful way in resovling any conflict or aggression commit against them at school . the be so obedient to rule and police . i want them to be street wise ; and when thing turn rough ; they can handle it . so may be they will gain some of this by move to doha ! ! i hope you understand my point ; i be not an agressive or agressor ; but boy ( future men ) they need to be tought to stand up for themselves if there be a need for it . us culture be totally different ; and it be more in the aggressive side compare to canada . currently i work in us ( since june 08 ) ; but i do not move my family yet . i be in a cross road ; where i need to decide once and for all if i be go to move to arabic country or settle for ever in na . giving my kid the opportunity to be fluent in arabic and experince islamic/arabic culture and true religious feastivities have be play in my mind for few year . it be vefry difficult to hear my kid speek arabic in a funny way/tone .
 wooo ... i guess the political and religious thread be the strong magnet in this community . my answer to the original question ... i would tell my child that she ca n't hate a group of people base on what `` some '' of them do ... if your colleague at school be nice to you ... be more nice to her/him regardless of what her nationality or regligion be . if she buy you a gift on your birthday ... be sure to save her birthday date on your calender and do n't forget to buy her a great gift . do not hate anyone unless you try and try and try and try to communicate your hurt to them ... tell them why you feel hurt by what they do and why their action be keep you from love them . war be an ugly thing . no baby deserve to die in return for a woman who get kill by a bomber ... and vice versa . in the end ; different people be influence by the culture they be raise in ... and from these culture they conclude their own opinion about different topic in life ... war ; sex ; education ; work ; religion ... etc . the best thing to do be to try to strip your mind off any biased idea and prejedice against any group of people . jews and israelis be very much unwelcommed and hat in the middle east ... because people hear and see everyday from the medium what israelis do to their brother and sister . in the western community ... .muslims be also unwelcommed and hat ... because people there see and hear from the medium what muslims do around the world . if you stand up for something ... you will have to prove you be right ... and you will have to suffer the consequence and responsibility for your beleifes . in the end ... i would tell my daughter to refer to the quran ... it explain best all what i'have just say .
 gone be the day when child use to ask : `` mom ; where do i come from ? '' or `` why be the grass green ? '' ... .  call me one .
 i 'll just say ... ... ... ... ... ... .. boycott israel- the sponsor of terrorism
 mom ; do you know israel ? my 8-yr. old son go up to me and ask `` mom ; do you know israel ? '' i say yes and ask him why 'd you ask ... he answer and say `` my classmate say that israel kill the baby in lebanon . '' as a parent ; how will you handle this ? i know israel be a big and delicate issue in middle east ...
 alexa thank you for this gesture ! boycott israel- the sponsor of terrorism
 we do not believe what we see on the tv or news paper . the propaganda machine in action ; do palestine really send missile into israel ? . are palestine suicide bomber really at work ? ? ? . if you start a war be prepare to win it . dont cry to u after you start and can not finish

 it ok..if they r hurt they can cry..
 everyone cry no matter what . `` human emotion ' . 'coz others perception be that when a man cry that mean weak ; which i disagree . it no longer an issue i knw but still exist . thank you and best wish **dont get discourage when thing go beyond your imagination because the great glory in life be not fall but rise everytime you fall . life be what you make it**
 is it ok for guys to cry ? i just want to know your opinion
 personally ; i do n't like if a guy cries..after all they consider to be a stone hearted person ...
 u be not make without tear why not ?
 soniya ; i think woman be more strong then men . anyways ; it very ok to cry.. `` think 100 time before you take a decision ; but once that decision be take ; stand by it a one man '' - muhammad ali jinnah
 hussein you be right . so if they can cry ; why not u ? .. it feel so good after waste some tear . `` think 100 time before you take a decision ; but once that decision be take ; stand by it a one man '' - muhammad ali jinnah
 woman be more patient than man do be i right ? thank you and best wish **dont get discourage when thing go beyond your imagination because the great glory in life be not fall but rise everytime you fall . life be what you make it**
 a man should never cry like a woman ; rather he should tackle his problem bravely ; it 's not a manly thing ; this cry ; but untill unless he lose a loved one ; then he would shed a few tear ; and carry on .
 i dont think so ... i disagree with that because no one on earth cry without any reason unless insane lol . thank you and best wish **dont get discourage when thing go beyond your imagination because the great glory in life be not fall but rise everytime you fall . life be what you make it**
 nothing wrong with men crying..and when they do & u happen to see them ; it be always true ... ; ) temper be something u cant get rid of ... by loose it ...
 it be not okay to cry even for baby unless they hurt ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! . but for you it be okay cause you need it bad lol !
 mr m ; come on ... shed some tear be cry too ! ! ! and it 's good to know that woman be the cause lol ... listen to the sound of silence ... .
 is it ok for guys to cry ? i just want to know your opinion
 it 's okay to cry ... real men should not be afraid to cry ... men who cry be confident with themselves that they be true men who be brave to accept their weakness ... who understand that break down or cry be not a sign of be sissy rather it be a natural human emotion that everyone have to go through . i have read somewhere that the percentage of breakdowns/ suicide be high in male than female ... female have the capacity to handle problems/situations because aside from friend and family who give them moral support ; their tear give way to bottle up emotion ... once they have a good cry ; they feel well and relieve .
 its healthy to cry to ease the pain .
 why you always cry ? thats why you 're healthy ? thank you and best wish **dont get discourage when thing go beyond your imagination because the great glory in life be not fall but rise everytime you fall . life be what you make it**
 i cry when i dont find anything to eat . so in both case ; i will go healthy ; ) `` think 100 time before you take a decision ; but once that decision be take ; stand by it a one man '' - muhammad ali jinnah

 lol asif
 a natural defense mechanism of the human body regardless of sex ( male or female ) ... although most men and woman as well ; think of cry a a sign of weakness . say `` only ladies cry . '' but for me a man who cry be a man who know himself throughly ... he understand very well that cry be a natural reaction..and do such can not or will never diminish his sexuality or manliness . he only want to feel well after every cry ... thus affirm his humanity . by the way ; animal do n't cry ... they go on rage . =========================== when in rome do a the romans do ! ! !
 its true that animal dont cry ; they only make cry : | < img src= '' http : //3.bp.blogspot.com/ '' >

 assembling a new super pc i 'd like to start assemble a new desktop pc . but i do n't wan na start order piece online and find out later that they be already available here for almost same prise . any advise on where do i check first . ?
 u both kid right ?
 make a list of your preferred part ; bring it to sofitel for a price qoute at least 3 shop ; then compare it online .
 i want a computer that will run crysis 2 smoothly . do u think i can get high-end part in sofitel ?
 i would not trust the sofitel one bit . fine for cheap cheap junk but not high end computer gear . i 'd also like to get a gaming rig . 2 option i 've see be an alienware m15x laptop at jarir bookstore and pc one on salwa road will import and alienware machine for you if you take a print out of the spec to them .
 there a shop < b > face sofitel < /b > that stock some good part ( outside - do n't remember the name ; but it 's the only one ) . a few year ago ; i get the motherboard ; case ; power supply ; graphic adapter ... . from them . i still have to get my core2extreme online ( my cpu alone be ~ $ 1200 ) .
 @ absolutejaguar . pc one . haa . i 've see that place before . but what do you mean import an alienware machine for me . ca n't they assemble one for me with the same spec and configuration . if they import it for me . what if there 's any mistake ; what about warranty or something ? i 'll check em out sometime . .. @ bleu do you know the name of that shop . i 'd like to see how 's their high-end gear .
 pc one do n't carry enough component ; you spec the machine on the alienware site ; then take that spec to the . they arrange to import of the machine from state ; ship ; customes etc . the shop outside the sofitel that bleu might be refer to be around the back ; away from the main road ; gigabyte i think ; and that be the brand they stock ; have a lot of over price liquid cool case last time i look .

 sometimes ; not always ... ... good luck
 yes you do need it i be afraid ; unless your work for any government department..
 of course you can bring it but beware ! a new car buy in uae will probably not be service by the main dealer here under warranty . a friend try to import an old car and they would n't let it in ; cost almost 100 ; 000 qr in port charge ; before it be resolve . you have the added complication of drive through saudi if coming overland . check everything before you try this .
 hey johnboy ; is that true ? five year old ? i be tell it be now 3 year old . i have a similar problem . i want to import my car ; however ; it be 5 year old .
 hi i think poeple are gauding u wrong . upon my information if the person is already in uae and he migrate on new visa ( work permet ) and he wana brought his car along with him . so i think without any cost he will bring it . because i been in saudi once for purpose of ummra over there ; and my cousine is in riyadh so he wana buy my car . so when i back to doha ; i ask on my sources so i got that i m not able .
 i want that ; too .

 find the name : moderator ... . : p cheer http : //www.qatarliving.com/node/1551325

 i am the one how u know
 if your question relate to technology ; let u know we can help you . regards
 oneshot..he be `` pren '' of mod hahahaha
 might be he want to create new ql ... qatarliving2.com = )
 who be the developer of qatarliving ? hello can anyone tell me who be the developer of this website ? ? i have to ask him some stuff ? thanks
 ahmad and me !
 his name be j. asange . right now he be in a lot of trouble with the law ; )
 oh my ; do n't think of that . surely 2 hour be way too much time to spend on buy a car .
 you have to pay atleast 10 ; 000qr more if you buy car over loan . the loan also depend on you salary . the bank will cut min . 1500qr per month and that also depend on how many year you want to pay loan ; 3/5 . good contact with any showroom person .
 car loan rate be usually `` flat '' the average/normal bank rate be between 4.5 to 6 % ( promos exclude ) so if you be buy a car ( eg . crv - qar.100 ; 000/- ) on a 5 year loan @ 5 % ; add 2.5 % - 3 % processing fee + 25 % interest + first year insurance say 5 % ... your total to pay bank be 100 ; 000+2500+25000+5000 i.e . ; 132 ; 000 therefore monthly instalment would be 132 ; 000/60 = qar.2 ; 208/- and it could vary slightly depend on the grace period you choose or bank offer for the first repayment . you can get the same term from car dealer 's inhouse financing ( if bankloan doesnt work ) but the rate could be 7.5-8.5 % good luck
 cant he just pickup a phone and call the relevant agency and get the rate ? that wouldnt take up much time isnt it ?
 thanks express for the info ... . so just in case i be change my job b4 5ys ; do i need 2 pay the entire amount to the bank b4 join a new company ? ? ?
 no ; you can change job within qatar ; your new company will provide a letter so you can keep the loan at repayment agree originally . i be leave qatar soon and be go to transfer the bank loan i have for my car to the next buyer as long a they be eligable for the loan . you can do this no problem . i have a toureg v8 if you be interested : )

 no problem at all ... you just have to present an ownership id if and when the police require you to do so ... just be safe and prevent accident
 i too be interested in this . if my friend lend me his car and i have a valid licence ; do his car insurance automatically cover me to drive ? in the uk car be insure under the name of the driver and if you want anyone else to drive it you have to put their name on the policy . is that the same here ?
 as far a i understand it ; it be the car that be insure not the driver . so as long a you have a valid driving licence ; qatari or otherwise you be insured to drive the vehicle .
 is any legal problem for drive the car of other person i hear there be rule in qatar one person can not drive the car of other person ( other than his sponsor ) . be it true ? pls let me know thanks in advance
 yes ; no problem you can drive other people 's car anytime as long a you do not hit something or bad someone . cheers ;

 hotels in doha i want to treat my husband for his bday at a romantic hotel ; which do you think of the hotel offer the best romantic scene ; room wise ; restraunt wise.. price be not an issue . im think w ? or ritz carlton ? or four season ?
 oh ok ! ur house bedroom isnt sufficient ? : ) ( jk )
 yes you need something with a close sea view . you should try al sharq . i think it be very romantic . they give you those room like little home ; nice sea view and great pools.. if you want to party ; it be not the place . w be my fav in term of service ; but it do not fall under the romantic category . 4 season suck . looks good from far but be far from good . grand hayat be ok ; it 's get a bit of everything you might need . i 'd still go to sharq if i be to impress someone and be super romantic tho .
 this hotel just open last sept..you can take a romantic walk down corniche after your dinner . if you request special pampering or surprise for your dear the staff might be willing to help you since they 're newly open and would likely accomodate their customer wish ... ; - ) http : //doha.frasershospitality.com/

 1 . agreed that white reflect heat ; but i doubt that it will do much effect on the car a the body be metal and it a conductor . 2 . dust do n't show much on a white car . 3 . easier to touch up white than any other shade of a color . 4 . it have evolve into a choice now . people just go for white car ! i go to one showroom once and they say they order for 50 % white car and the rest 50 % other color .
 there be much reason about it . first one be that arabic people like white color ... 2nd be about heat.. 3rd dust.. and so on
 white be coooooooooooooooooool in cars buddy ? aint it ? ? ?
 90 % white cars ... ? ? ? ? pardon my ignorance ... .new to the gulf ... just wonder why 90 % plus car be white in color ? ... do it have something to do with the climate ( 'cause white color absorbs less heat ... . ) ... .or some other reason.. ?
 becoz `` white the best ''
 white be cool ; look good easy on cleaning always look new with less manintaince.safe in night even from long distance so natuarally people prefer white.may be your first car here will be white too : )
 i do not remember the name exactly but there be a shop at 3rd floor i think . you can find pant ; bag ; shoe and such stuff there . they sell nice stuff like columbia ; titanium ; etc.. but it hard to find sizes sometimes . the shop be beside timberland . `` what do n't kill me ; make me strong ... ''
 i doubt you will find what be you look for . sleeping bag be available but you might need to have at least 3 season for winter hike . trekking stick and some good stuff be available in the new sport shop in villagio ; near food court . expensive shop but some good stuff be there . if you be not able to find good clothing ; go with the layer . the best thing ( if you can find ) be breathable wind breaker/rain jacket .
 `` make a difference or make way '' should you need heavy duty back pack i get two brand new on sale . the north face from usa
 sleep bag that you buy here wont work there coz it winter season in the himalayan region and you need small ; and light sleep bag that can withstand temperature upto -10 degree celcius or more .
 i buy a back pack from souq asiri for 180 riyal . held everything that i need . bought a sleep bag from city centre for 65qr and the moment i use it ; i start regret my decision . i be still dead freezing . i be paralyse from one low limb ; so i have to carry what i be able to carry and most of the time the stuff i take with me think that i might need it sometime later on be not even use . so the next time i go ; i will just take myself and some extra cash with me a everything be available wherever you go . i go to pakistan to the karakoram and cross over to china . the best trip of my life and i will be go back again . visit hunza in pakistan and karakul lake in china when you go there and make your way to east to tibet . its amazing .
 you emphasize on `` baaaaad '' a in mj bad or character wise ? : -p < a href= '' http : //www.myhotcomments.com/ '' > < img src= '' http : //lc.fdots.com/cc/lc/2e/2ed9c2cd5daf0a03c79c7e020c023fa7.gif '' border= '' 0 '' alt= '' myhotcomments.com '' > < /a > < br > < a href= '' http : //www.myhotcomments.com/graphics/2905 '' > < /a > < br clear= '' leave '' >

 resale of a kia versus nissan thanks for early response . does a nissan have good resale than kia ?
 yap nissan sunny 2001 price 19000qr
 yes ; you be right ! ! nissan have good resale than kia
 well ; i would go for neither of them ; a both of those company have low resale value . it be true that nissan have high resale value than kia ; but both of them have low . as someone say ; that a car do n't matter as long a you like it ; but you also need to look after the resale value . the two company with the high resale value be honda and toyota . i would recommend these 2 out of all .

 hair loss : ( lossing my hair so badly ! ! ! ! ! be it common with qatar water ? ? ? ?
 start use bottled drinking water to wash my hair . let see if this help to stop losing ! almost can see my scalp in the mirror get bad .
 check if your bottled water have add flouride . most probably it have . use masafi from the emirate . i would suggest evian ; with a weekly dose of budweiser or corona beer a conditioner ( because it 's not fit for human consumption anyway )
 my mom use to tell me ; we need to store water for atleast 2 hr before use it on hair . am try now . i can see the change . hair may not grow ; but fall off have reduce ... ..u cn try it ... .. : ) ... .and hv heard d same from a beautician who ws interviewd in tv ... ..so i guess thats one way ... .
 did you ever get chect your vit d ; iodine and magnesium level . you will be deficient in them . if you be iodine deficient your tsh maybe elevate which also cause hair loss .

 the gps should be able to give ur position almost properly but dont rely on the map cause the map be n't update usually.. beta be careful otherwise u will land up on some closed road if u be follow gps : p
 try this app . sygic.. google it.. or youtube it..
 gps work exceptionally well in desert country like the gulf a there be very less tree cover . desert storm be a gps war ... lol you can not lose your way even in low visiblity time like sand stroms etc . while in place with very dense tree cover ; gps signal be interrupt ... .its definitely a problem in kerala ... .because of so much coconut and other tree cover . gps war would prove ineffective there ... lol most of the phone have 2 mode of connection : 1 . assisted gps will use cell site to connect ; quick connect ; but it have charge . this be usless in place where there be no cell-site like sealine ... etc . i suggest to switch it off unless you literally can not get a gps signal even after 15minutes . 2 . integrated gps uses the true satellite signal to connect . it take about 1 to 3 minute to find a minimum of 3 satellite ; depend on where you stand . it can not function without reach 3 or 4 satellite . advantages of phones over stand alone sat nav unit be : 1 . you carry the phone everywhere ... .chances of forget it be next to zero . 2 . you can send your coordinate a mms so someone comming to meet you in a remote place ... .say you be meet a group in the desert . 3 . convenience ... it have everything in a single unit ... .especially the camera . 4 . its dirt cheap if you split the cost a below : ( a ) phone ; ( b ) camera ; ( c ) music/video player ( d ) camera ( e ) gps < b > best gps mobile be samsung omnia qr 1850 < /b > ( carrefour ) 8gb card ; 5mp camera ; excellent wifi ; due to windows os ; touch screen ; garmin xt mobile gps software ;
 gps of iphone 3gs hello everybody ; i just want to ask something about iphone 3gs ... do the gps work properly here in doha qatar ? ? theres any problem about iphone 3gs gps ? ? im wait for your response thanks guyzzz
 does any cne know about shary qtel cost of ramadan offer ?
 i have an iphone 3gs . both the gps and maps be just fine . i can pinpoint my location even inside the office .
 c'mon guy ! comment on something that be useful . @ jailbroken114 ; for you it work perfectly because your 're connect to your office 's wireless network ; so the iphone can download the map live from the net . give it a try and go to mesaeed in the desert and you will see that you will still have gps ( free all over the world - global positioning system ) signal but no map . so ; how can you navigate back to safety during a sand storm for example . nor qtel or vodafone offer 3g support for iphone ; hence you have no internet ; hence you have no map . hence - you ca n't call that navigation ; right ?
 my experience be excellent use cygic and google maps and the build in maps app preloaded into the iphone . tried it and test it to work perfectly with cygic you do n't need the internet connection . to pre register from my 1st hand experience .
 yup i think it would work fine anywhere ; even in the loo . but it wo n't be able to determine the exact precise location of yours ; maybe within a few 100 metre would do . `` everything be okay in the end ; if it 's not ok ; then it 's not the end . '' `` when one door close ; another open ; but we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one that have open for u . ''
 i find out a great solution..alternative to tom tom and garmin ..workz with charm in my iphone 3g much beter and with routing and turn by turn voice help..much much good than garmin..checkout my post on the forum topic in section `` advice and help '' ..
 yes ... .
 it 's safe than australia for both men and woman . there be lot of kindergarten ; just do n't procrastinate find one and get acceptance . and yes ; be prepare to be star at constantly . either just stare back or ignore it .
 in the middle east this is the safest place and void of any public indecency as in dubai or baharain .
 do n't worry ; this be a safe country ... be star constantly be just a normal thing here . also ; good to have a car when you 're here than commute ... not only to avoid the stare but also the b.o of other passenger : ( ewwwwww ! ! ! !
 hi there . is it safe to work there ? for woman as well ? kindergardens for expat ? is anyone look strange at hi there . is it safe to work there ? for woman as well ? kindergardens for expat kid available ? is anyone look strange at you at shop and on the street ? cheers.mihai
 women stare just as much a men ; particularly at western people . apart from the rudeness i encounter from other woman occasionally ; and the competition to have have the most baby ; i do n't find living here a problem .
 it be safe but i be a working mum and i find these diffciulties ... .i have a business visa and could not sponsor a nnanny therefore i be leave with maid who have company visa and or be illegal or not experienced but immediately look foir the next job . i test three but find none to satisfactory - my child be 2 and 4 so i keep them home a the fee for school a driver and the time the kid would have to get up be crazy i have a one hour commute each way so my day be waste drive not with my kid . the near park to my home could be reach by car only ; and the traffic sometimes make it a two hour exercise just in drive . the hospital be ok but the public one be accessible for appointment during work hour and the private one expensive . i have a contract that allow no unpaid leave and have penalty for missed work even if your kid be sick . needless to say when my husabnd want to return home and resume his work and i have be unable to hire help and my son have an epileptic seizure - i give notice and come home . as an expatriate worker with family i have find much friendly country to work in where large percentage of your pay stay with you and be not absorb by high rent school fee and food price . you need a good salary if you want to do all you want . in your contract get a vila provide and education for kid and a vihicle rent allowance and you can have an ok expat lifestyle . it depend on your salary - a labourer might be con into come for 280 riyal a month - god know how they survive . i get 14 ; 000 + and i decide i be well take 40 ; 000 aud per annum salary cut and work somewhere cost be cheap and lifestyle more family friendly i still do n't have a job but i be very happy with my decision to prioritse my kid and leave qatar for the qataris- mostly i find people with family where the woman or both parent work less then satisfy with the cost access to care and quality of care for their kid - people on huge salary who can afford to join the intercontinental beach club and the wife and kid spend every after schoool moment there seem satisfied - live in a compound with play facility and you may be ok . good luck .

 try with your company if they can sponsor them until you get your rp..
 best way ; just wait for your rp ; do n't be hurry before that ; for all reason it will be the best solution ... .al the best .
 try go to travel agents.. they can do something.. or go to the hotels.. in the hotel ; tourist visa be 200qr but the problem you have to check-in for about two to three nights.. i do that last time ; when my wife come here ... quite costly though..
 one year be enough for naql kafala ( sponsorship change )
 sponshorship change do n't matter if it 1 or 2 year . coz if your current sponsor/employer wo n't give you an noc ( no objection certification ) ; you ca n't change sponsorship ... unless it 'll a transfer to a family/husband/wife visa .
 thank you for the input . i have some clarity now . there be contradictory view when i check ; some say for the first transfer one have to wait for 2 year with first sponspor even if he give noc ; some say one year be fine provide noc be there etc . thanks again
 hi fairdeal ? any update ? do you manage to change sponsor ? ? we have same situation now..
 its great that you have noc . you can transfer your sponsorship after one year .
 normally it 's 2 year . could be 1 ; in certain circumstance and on the exceptional base .
 sponsorshiip transfer how may year do one need to continue with his first sponsor in qatar before sponsorship can be transfer ? the current sponsor provide noc . is the criterion 1 year or 2 year . pls advise.thanks
 the rule be you have to have be with your first sponsor for 2 yr before you can transfer to another and that too only if you get an noc . if the employer for some reason do give u an noc before the 2 yr period be over you still can not trf your sponsor to a new guy cuz the immigration will not accept . so for such case you will be work a a 'borrowed ' employee till you complete the 2 yr . we just face this situ in our office
 tinker ... i change my sponsorship from my first sponsor right after one year . there be no special circumstance involve ; so i suppose ; it one year . two year ban be mostly for those whose visa have be cancel .
 khattak - be this recently ? cuz this happend for u just abt 3 month ago . the guy be a lebanese . so we now have another 3 month to go before he can change over to u .
 khattak - u r rite about that . no one know when rule change in this part of the world .

 no . it have a small explosive charge ; so unless you want lock up ; pack it in the hold .
 anything that have a word gun be ban and you be talk about carry something that not only have the word gun ; but also explodes and make noice and be bind to go wrong without notice . i do n't know if there be any charge ; but yes there be a spring that make noice and can create panic if explodes .
 no . even if it be a plastic toy ; they will not allow . i have similar experience .
 not allow even in hold baggage . do n't even try ; unless you want to miss your flight . remember you have to answer a declaration when you check in ; any false statement lead to arrest ( always ! )
 u ca n't take a a hand luggage ... keep it in ur luggage ; i hope there will be no problem.. i have travel once from uae.. : - )
 no ; even check in baggage will not allow that because there is flammable substance on the base of the canister once it was twist ; it will explode ...

 goto german embassy and get chengen visa & enjoy 14/15 country for six month
 nationality : india so there be no requirement to stay/arrive in the country from whose embassy we take schengen visa ? if yes ; then thats great news .
 hi . i 'm also apply for schengen visa right now and we have the same issue . during the past 3 year i always have to send my document to swiss embassy in kuwait but since oct 1 ; 2012 ; they implement vis which require personal appearance so they can take your biometric data which will be valid for 5 year . i call the embassy if there be no other alternative than go to kuwait and i be tell none . so i decide to change my itinerary and go to germany first so i can apply in german embassy instead . tips . you have to show them that your point of entry be germany and/or you will spend most of your stay in germany . ( ticket and hotel booking a proof ) . goodluck !

 why do n't you go to the bahamas ! i be the prodigy
 try al khor for a change .
 if i be you i will use kl a a base ... so kl - penang - kl ; then kl - tioman - kl . which way you want to do them first doesnt matter . i be not sure if you can fly from penang direct to tioman ... but worth to check with berjaya air . penang should be fine for 1 week ... make sure you visit kek lok si temple and take alot of photo . i dont know what be your liking ... but me think a week in tioman might be a bit too long ? except if you like dive they have a beautiful dive spot in tioman . you need to go to subang airport ... to go to tioman and book a flight with berjaya air . make sure when you tell the taxi you want subang aiport not kuala lumpur international airport .
 also google melaka ; quite interesting place to walk around ... especially the chinatown and it redsquare ...
 my pal and i believe tioman 's fine for a non-diving holiday too . but december should be right smack in the middle of the monsoon season which hit the east coast of malaysia ( nov to feb/march . but there 's the monsoon cup - 3-7 december 08 if you can make it and take some nice shot . as for penang and malacca - yes ; you should go esp . if you 're a photographer . i dunno but i 'm assume you be . the sight and colour would be very interesting indeed . east malaysia be also beautiful but not sure if you can fit all that in . mt . kinabalu ; the high peak in south east asia & a world heritage site ; maliau basin conservation area ; mulu caves ; etc . there 're so many thing to see . ***************************************** life be short . live it to the full !

 the royal bintang ; which one ? in bukit bintang ? or the one at the curve ? bukit bintang area be great to walk about and snap shot . if you 've be to kl before ; then you 'd know . careful of the `` working lady '' around some of the pubs - enforcement not as strict a qatar : -0 renaissance melaka - nice . evergreen laurel in penang - not sure but think should be fine . penang island be very nice . japamala resort in tioman - this one ; my pal say be really very nice . langkawi be also very nice ; maybe well a on the west coast and away from the monsoon side . duty free alcohol too . /are you sure you do n't want to change venue ? the accommodation may be cheap for an expensive resort like that but if it 's rain all the time and sea be rough ; do n't think you can go diving or snorkel even . best timing for east coast of malaysia be march to october or early nov. before monsoon season start . ***************************************** do n't want no drama ; no ; no drama ; no ; no ; no ; no drama

 @ alumnar - what brand do you buy ? and how much be it ?
 just bring your stuff ; it will work either within the 'european ' socket or you get adadpters .
 plugs from uk ? hello - be just wonder about move stuff over from the uk - will our electricals work out there - dvd ; tv . fridge etc etc - or do we need converter plug or something ? thanks
 3 pin plug will work in qatar no problem a the socket be the same ( they be the last time i be there in 2004 ) tv be not sure a we buy ours in qatar . we buy a dvd player in qatar and it work fine in the uk with uk buy dvds but again they be cheap enough to buy in qatar .
 plug socket here be all 3-pin uk style . however ; you might want to bring a stock of 3-pin to 2-pin adaptor with you because anything you by out here will be 2-pin ; and the adapter you buy here be very low quality and i 've see many catch fire or melt .
 so if all the plus socket be 3 pin why be the product 2 pin ? so do you mean i need a 2 pin to 3 pin adaptor ? i be confused ... sorry !
 i expect plug socket be 3-pin co qatar use to be protect by the british . just a guess . appliances be 2-pin co they come from asia i think . it 's juts one of many wonderful thing that defy logic here in qatar . you 'll need adapter that plug into the 3-pin wall socket and take a 2-pin plug .
 have some patience and change the plug on new item to 3-pin plug . i hate the adapter here ; a previously mention the quality be rubbish and they can melt .
 the same applies to the 3-pin plug you buy here a the adapter - they be cheap and prone to catch fire . best to bring your own from the uk .
 while you may find someone to install it ; i believe the reason you ca n't find them here be that be `` radio control '' they have to be allow by the government ( in order that the frequency use do n't interfere with any of the official radio frequency ) - at least that 's what i be tell 8 year ago .
 sorry i want to say government not police
 these device utilise the unlicensed frequency range which do n't interfere with any gov official radio freq range ; just like your cordless phone . any skilled auto electrician should be able to install it ; but be careful unskilled technician can damage your car . these remote starter be available for sale at any car ' access shop ( around 500 qr ) ; i have one for sale if you be interested ( brand new ; still in box ) .
 as a single `` user '' perhaps you do n't have to worry . i inquire with a north american manufacturer in order to import and sell them here - they advise that one of the document require be a government permit for the radio frequency concern . as i say ; it be 8 year ago . times change .
 remote car starter device installation hi ; is there a place close to salwa road that they can install a remote starter device to my car ? i have the device already i just need someone to install it . thank you ;
 thank you hamadacz for the info . but do you know anyone good in doha and if it 's possible close to salwa ?
 interest question.. i too need the answer..qlates.. put some worthful ... plzz
 yes ; you can sponsor your first line relative and bring them on visit under qatar airways visa provide you meet the application criterion ( simple : yours and your wife 's passport/id copy ; confirm return ticket booking on qa and the visitor 's pp copy ) ( you can apply direct at immigration also for first line relative )
 yes you can but your salary should be 12000 qr per month minimum

 export my car i be plan to export my 2005 toyat - camary to india ( kerala ) ; please let me know which be the cheap way of send it and hows do these work ?
 for sure you can ship your car for the purpose . its call a an escort . it be the same procedure that you take the vehicle to other gcc place . you have to apply for a permission to export the vehicle a an escort . but make sure that the vehicle be register under your name and not in the bank . otherwise you have to obtain an noc from the bank . also there be an additional charge for insurance . then you have to consult a shipment company and you have to make a two way bill . once it reach there in india no need to pay any taxes . as per my knowledge you can use the vehicle there in india up to 1 year

 mazda cx9 all the way.. it be name best sporty suv of year 2009 and have win several award ... the only disadvantage would be resell value compare to any toyota . check it out in the market . but the driving experience of the mazda cx9 be way well then prado..you can watch the review on serveral website such a http : //www.edmunds.com/
 technical comparison ... toyota land cruiser prado 2010 - 2011 engine gearbox power ( hp ) torque ( nm ) fuel econ ( l/100km ) 0-100 kph ( sec ) top spd ( kph ) 4.0 v6 4wd 6m/5a 271hp 381nm 12.5-13.0 8.5-9.0sec 200 good off-road ability ; 2nd-row space ; cargo room bad base engine power ; weak 3-door version ; dull on-road handling ; pricey option mazda cx-9 2010 - 2011 engine gearbox power ( hp ) torque ( nm ) fuel econ ( l/100km ) 0-100 kph ( sec ) top spd ( kph ) 3.7 v6 fwd/4wd 6a 273hp 367nm 13.1 8.3sec 194* good sharp look ; good handling ; roomy enough interior bad below-average fuel economy ; heavy ; off-road ability ; pricey & ofcourse hell of difference between price ...
 cx9 be more crossoverish whereas prado be a proper suv and look like one too . a toyota be definitely more reliable than mazda .
 car comparison : prado to mazda cx9 how be the comparison between prado and mazda cx9 ? which one would be a good buy ?
 the only advantage of prado be the resale value . both be not real off-road option . so for on-road cx-9 be much more fun to drive ( acceleration & stability ) and much good look . the myth of the toyota be more reliable be a very local belief that have no fact to support it . also do n't fall for the claim of low cost maintenance of toyota . i have a lc ; the brake master and booster cost 8000 qar which be double the cadilac escalade that be claim to be one of the high when it come to maintenance cost .
 do n't sell you car before buying.. go for good option & comfort rather price it before buy ! !
 wait & see
 i be also look for the late list of traffic violation . but what i can get be the one issue in 2007 ; which be so old .
 illegal parking be 300qr plus 3 point

 if you be look for a class building with full maintenance along with fully furnish ; you can expect the rent at least 5 ; 500 permonth plus electricity & water .
 in some place the cost be so high that you have to pay by hour for one bedroom ...
 i 'd go with ezdan 5k approx per month plus or minus 500
 when be you plan to move here ... i have a two bedroom fully furnish flat in ezdaan ; al wakra for 4000..fully furnish in the sense you dont have to get anything include bedsheet.. : ) it jus 20 min drive from doha and available from 15th of oct..

 ikea
 if you 're look for restaurant quality the new house complex on b ring road near the muntazah intersection carry a wide variety . they be expensive but worth it in my opinion
 tavola have the most expensive kitchenware ; so i assume it 's good .
 ikea be a good start they sale dutch oven ... but a bit small in my taste .
 go to any super market ( carrefour ; lulu ; etc.. ) ; they have tefal ; the quality be very good . also others like prestige be good as well .
 thanks for your information ! : - )
 no ; you should be fine to return .
 no . you do n't need any noc . you can enter easily ... ... ; )

 vegetable market and wholesale market hi ; i go to the wholesale market on saturday but could n't buy anything a i have to buy box only of vegetable that i would have have to waste ... i be tell that there be also a vegetable market where i can buy by the kg ... can anybody explain me where it be ? thanks ...
 vegetable market you probably go to the one where you park your car in front of a row of shop sell produce ? they sell in volume ( box only ) right across from it be the other more visited market . you have to go inside one of the open door to see the true market . there you can buy just 1 tomato ; 1 carrot etc . they be next to each other .
 i completely disagree with that . in my experience ( over 5 year here now ) the fruit & vegetable market produce be by and far the best you can buy in doha . the grocery store have improve ; but they can not match the freshness from of the wholesale market .
 thanks everybody ! will try again this weekend and see if we can find it ... it be chaos anyway but a wonderful experience nevertheless ! ! !
 be the market open during the evening ? ? ? ? ? ? whats the timing for retail seller ?

 be direct employment safe ? hi everyone ; i 'd like to get your opinion and/or comment ... be it safe to consider direct employment ? would appreciate your feedback ... = )
 if you be ask about direct employment versus contract employment ; i would prefer direct .
 but many try their luck . many safenets be place to make sure that an ofw will be safe once in foreign country . if you be a direct hire but go with the official protocol ( except you do not pass through an agency ) ; it 's okay because you will be a documented ofw . but if you be a direct hire and not an official ofw ; i also discourage it !
 it 's direct employment against employment via recruitment agency
 recruitment agency be only after their commission so be generally good to go direct ; unless the company be disreputable ... ... ..in which case there be many here .
 i be a direct hire . what you need to do be check first the company hire you . for me it be easy because i know some compatriot who work for the company in it different branch here in the gulf region . also please check the process in poea ; i believe they have change it last year . so the process i go through be not the same anymore where i have to go through each step myself . as far a i know it be not anymore `` direct hire '' or `` name hire '' per se a you will need to have your document process through an employment agency and not by yourself .
 and it safe..but a mr. treysdad sez ; ; ; check first the company and then later there be still some paper to process from poea ... congratz and goodluck ! : )
 i will do a you say ... but the soon-to-be employer even send me a lengthy step by step procedure to accomplish up to poea ... treysdad hopefully ; i wont need agency anymore . my paper be already with the employer for visa processing.hope it would be release this week . jaryz ; thanks for your comment ...
 a per the procedure give to me ; i will go to poea only when visa have already be stamp by qatar embassy here in phils ... here be what 's write ... 5.once the passport with stamped visa be receive ; proceed to philippine overseas employment administration ( poea ) for verification of the of employment contract and submit the following document for issuance of exit pas or overseas employment certificate ( oec ) : original employment contract visa medical certificate prc license pre-departure orientation seminar certificate ( to be schedule and provide by poea ) get very nice support from the employer ; it be them who introduce ql to me . = )
 will it be safe if i go to poea only after visa stamping or should i go there even before that ?
 with your medical certificate because it usually take 3 day to a week for the result . they will only release the result once you have the visa . but it 's good to start it so that if you have problem ( like high sugar ; high blood pressure ; etc . ) you can take corrective action or take a second opinion and try to get well medical result and have `` fit to work '' evaluation .
 be direct employment safe ? hi everyone ; i 'd like to get your opinion and/or comment ... be it safe to consider direct employment ? would appreciate your feedback ... = )
 i be suppose to have the medical early than receviing the visa but unfortunately the clinic i go require me to present my visa first . hopefully my health do not go bad after undertake annual physical exam for my current employer . another thing ; do you know of any qatar embassy accredit clinic be worth visit ? i have read in some post that there be really those clinic who tend to harvest money from aspire ofws . i wish to go to a clinic that can me fair result whether or not positive but at least it be true . wish ko lang ... heheh.. sa mga taga jan baka meron sila mairecommend na clinic dito sa pinas ...
 maybe ; just make sure you check the company that you will be work for ... like i tell you ; my cousin use to work there but resign ; but she be not directly employ from the phils ...
 thank you so much mj . will you be kind to let me contact your cousin ? i wish to at least ask some few question ... she/he can contact me at jolisa.b.calib @ gmail.com.. would really appreciate it ...
 log on to ql ! lol ! good luck ; make sure you have the oec and that you will be a documented ofw !
 so by direct hire you mean ; they will be send you a work visa from here ? correct me if i 'm wrong..
 thanks ; will do that ... = )
 ilazzie ; ask lng sana . na email ko na sa frend ko ang work visa from the company.. i advise her to go to the near dhl office para sa authentication ng visa nya.. be it the right step ? and can you please tell me what she need to do next ? be medical check-up require ? please do advice me ; excite na yung frend ko na mkawork dito pero nalilito kami paano i-process ang paper nya sa pinas..
 meryl ; english only in the main forum.. what kind of visa do your friend have ? if it 's only visit visa ; no need for medical check up ; just authentication from the embassy .
 if she 's hold a work visa she need to undergo medical examination in the philippines . it 's good to be sure she have all necessary document ; you never know what document the officer in our airport require.. sometimes ; they can be very strict..
 if she be hold a working visa ; she really need to undergo medical exam ; visa stamp in qatar embassy in phils ; also in poea she will be require to submit original copy of her contract .
 be direct employment safe ? hi everyone ; i 'd like to get your opinion and/or comment ... be it safe to consider direct employment ? would appreciate your feedback ... = )
 lp ; fortunately the contract i submit in poea be accept even when it do not have authentication yet from qatar embassy
 lp ; it 's true
 based on my experience ; yes it quite safe than in agency..more cost beneficial between the employer and employee ... ..
 if your cousin have the visa already from her present employer ... my advice be to present a standard employment contract which i have a format here if you want i will send you the format on which you will attest or her employer in polo . you can follow there the req . for direct hire .
 dieting be effective but it quite slow process ; most effective be exercise specially if u do it for abdominal muscle . and make sure to quit 3 thing ; 1.sweets 2.rice 3.sleeping immediately after have meal . i m sure u wil see good result : ) good luck
 cmd ? ? ? ? what be that ? ? give me that : - )
 hi ; honestly ; there be no quick way . an unhealthy way be to take a diaretic ; but you will lose only water ; not fat . that be a temp . fix . as far a medication ; there be only one which be call orlistat . it inhibit the enzyme that break down fat ; so this will allow fat to pass through you . other than that ; the other diet aid be false ; or caffiene-based . in that case ; drink coffee . the not eating rice at night be good advice . remember ; it be down to physic : when you eat about 7500 more calorie than you burn ; you gain a kg . the same be true for lose it .

 look like u r into forge the paper instead of joinning the school ! why do n't u go to the school itself and ask for sample ? ? ?
 call aptech to give them the certificate directly ... or even good they will help u in print the certificate for u ... pple like u be disgrace ; ask openly to be part of a forgery ... .
 it seem you be more interested in look at graphic & design of the certificate than acquire knowledge & skill .

 'afwan ; mj . edit : on behalf of everyone above .
 unfortunately it matter where you come from ; not what you know or what kind of qualification you have . if that be not racist discrimination ; i do n't know what be .
 get marry to a european .
 maybe because the cost of living in europe be much much high than in asia ?
 thats the way it be ; unfortunate ; but reality of favoritism in this country . *bunga*
 this kind of practice could have be pace out sooner for white collar job however for technical job it could be the different in approach and superiority to do trouble shoot and problem solving . however for company do a simple process and routine ; theres no reason for difference in pay .
 supply and demand ; capitalism 101 pure and simple . if enough well educate ; well train ; well experience ; well qualified 'asians ' ( japanese usually get high offer ) refuse to work for a quarter of salary of a comparable europeans then in theory the company will have to offer more to attract them . unfortunately ; in practice for every asian that refuse to work for a quarter of the european 's salary there be ten more line up to work for one-fifth . i think the question should be re-phrased : why would company hire a european/american/australian/japanese etc for four time the salary of a comparably qualify 'asians ' ? ? ? ? ? cheers sk
 sabrang kidul ; that look reasonable and probably right .
 sorry to say my friend that discrimination be well alive in this country . most of the time asians have more experience and even get high degree of education against westerns . the sad reality be that most company be impress with the way they look and converse in english ... but of course ! ! that 's their mother tongue . but let them write a proper business letter ... most of them be unprofessional . some company look also for the passport when hire people . but you know what ? if your company get nonsense recruitment personnel and system ... they easily deceive by western . no offense to western people but these point of view be base on fact ... however some of them be qualify a well ... not be unfair and speak generally .
 it 's to do with the cost of living in home country and other aspect . if you look around ; on the whole ; a western expat will get more in asia ; russia and africa also .
 wage accord to nationality ? ? i be wonder why the european expat be be pay quadruple the salary of asian who have the same or even more experience and education ? ? ? at least thats the way it be in my work place .
 nobody be perfect - i be nobody i think arab be in awe of europeans and afraid of them . i think maybe they feel inferior to them or do not want to look cheap in front of them so they give them more salary to show that they be also superior and can afford them ... ..even though the european guy maybe out of work and usless in his country and desperate to get some work here.he just want to come here for a couple of year to have some fun & sun and escape the cold and rain for while and spice up his resume to resettle back with some real work experience . at least thats what i have see in doha for the last 10 year . i have no grouse against them nor have i be affect adversly by them at any point of time . ... ... ..just my opinion .
 hi alexa ; i 'm ask a rethorical question about why would company hire a 'westerner ' ( i prefer to use this term ) for 4 time the salary of 'asians ' . according to a pure cost-benefit point of view ; they would expect and should get a quadruple of productivity from the westerner . question be ; do they ( company or state for this matter ) get what they bargain for ? the answer be ( if indeed it be true that westerner be pay 4 time more ; a proposition that need to be investigate far ) a resounding yes ; a we can see more westerner be arrive and base on the cost benefit principle above ; company feel that they still get ahead by hire westerner . here we assume that no one ( company or state ) be stupid enough to prefer lose instead of win . there 's a catch though . by 'productivity ' they may not only refer to tangible thing such a amount of product you produce or sale achievement . it may also include thing such a prestige ( ie . this real estate company be under british management ) or something a cynical ( a another poster put it ) fear or subconcious inferiority complex . true or nor ; i do n't know ... . myself ; if i think i be underpaid ( dont really care what my colleages get ) ; then i 'll try to negotiate a good deal . if i can not get a good deal ; then i try to prove that i be underpaid by look at a good job that give me more . if i can not find a good job ; then may be i 'm pay exactly what my market worth be ... ... . might as well shut my mouth and enjoy ... ... ( note : 'paid ' here mean the total compensation i get : sallary ; job satisfaction ; quality of live ; traffic ; red tape etc ) . enough bubling past my curfew . adios for tonight ; cheer sk
 your passport carry more weight than your work around here.. i be in sale ; i bring twice the business that some guy from other country bring ; i get pay less than half of their salary . that 's life.. < a href= '' http : //s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/ ? action=view & current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg '' target= ''  '' > < img src= '' http : //i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg '' border= '' 0 '' alt= '' photobucket '' > < /a >
 three cheer to you . it 's happen in kuwait and in saudi ; it 's be discussed time and time again and it 's a matter of economics . that 's my last post in this topic .

 i have a basic question . for how many indians ; middle east be first choice for work ? usually ; those who work here be already reject from us and european country ( and 70 % be reject by their own country ) i do n't know about other field ; but the doctor work in middle east be substandard compare to their own counterpart in india and the european doctor be even more substandard to these already substandard doctor . now ; the conclusion be that quality control be a joke here . employing few european ( and one or two americans ) make thing look good . but they ca n't afford more than few and so they employ majority asian at cheap rate to be cost effective ; and the end result be a substandard organisation which spend lot of money ; have poor performance and manipulated quality control ( usually through medium ) . are you nut ? ... ... no doubt i be crazy about you !
 quite clearly ; you have n't the faint idea what you 're talk about & you have n't interact with a lot of educate ; inform ; well travelled non-westerners ... probably have something to do with the fact that you 're a racist bigot ... there 's an informed decision ... from a non-westerner ... deal with it ...
 @ sun26872 ... middle east be first choice for many indians so you 're completely wrong about that one ; for a lot of indians ; they do n't mind come to the mideast 'cos it 's just a 3hr . flight from home ; earnings be tax-free & there be a lot of people from their community/town/village ... they ca n't find that in the west ; it 's too cold from them for half the year or more ; it 's halfway around the world & no way would they be able to afford that 16 hr . flight ticket once a year like they do here & they pay tax on their earnings ; put yourself in their shoe ; would the west still be your first choice ? ... i think not ... you be right about the fact that most of the good indian doctor ( & india produce some of the best on the planet a i presume you know already ) choose to stay @ home or go west but it would be unfair to say that because of that all indian doctor in the mideast be substandard or the european doctor here for that matter ... a lot of them move ; again for the tax-free income ; to try a new place ; a new lifestyle ; a life partner who 's base here ; there be so many thing that factor into that descision ... quality control a you rightly state be in most case a joke but again that do n't apply across the board ... a well trained person ; wherever it be they be from ; be unlikely to compromise on standard ...
 life is unfair and thats it
 @ alexa ; you 're confuse me with someone else luv ! ... i live briefly in the uk & briefly in the caribbean but i be educate & train in my home country i.e india @ well repute institution & i 'm very proud of it ...
 wage accord to nationality ? ? i be wonder why the european expat be be pay quadruple the salary of asian who have the same or even more experience and education ? ? ? at least thats the way it be in my work place .
 that could be a reason arabic along with the colour of the skin too.. all the other reason mention above be plain nonsense in my opinion . i be willing to put my education and knowledge to the test against any of the western expatriate work here in similar field and there wo n't be much difference . as for someone mentioning above that indians come here because they ca n't get job anywhere else ; well i work for the same company here for which i be work in india ; the company which pick me from my campus so maybe the desire of not leave that company get me here rather than any lack of job opportunity . < a href= '' http : //s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/ ? action=view & current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg '' target= ''  '' > < img src= '' http : //i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg '' border= '' 0 '' alt= '' photobucket '' > < /a >
 mp i love what i do and i get pay 4 time here for the same thing i be do back home so i stay.. i already accept that ; i be just say he get more pay because of high cost of living in his home country and his skin colour ; not because he be good than me at what we do like some people be suggest here . < a href= '' http : //s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/ ? action=view & current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg '' target= ''  '' > < img src= '' http : //i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg '' border= '' 0 '' alt= '' photobucket '' > < /a >
 colour discrimination occur everywhere ; if you do n't know that then you have live in a very protective world . higher cost of live back home matter a most of the expat be work here to save money and one day go back home to settle down with their saving here . < a href= '' http : //s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/ ? action=view & current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg '' target= ''  '' > < img src= '' http : //i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg '' border= '' 0 '' alt= '' photobucket '' > < /a >
 westerners come in all colour ; y'know ? there 's probably a big difference in cost of living in home country though . *****if you have n't get anything nice to say ; do n't say anything at all*****
 i be talk from my experience snessy ; we have only white from those country in our company and know their salary ; i know how much more they be get pay for the same and at time even less job ... < a href= '' http : //s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/ ? action=view & current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg '' target= ''  '' > < img src= '' http : //i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg '' border= '' 0 '' alt= '' photobucket '' > < /a >
 i empathise sandeep ; i agree you should earn the same a your western colleague . for hubby & i ; we 're not earn enough to save either ; our mortgage and bill back in the uk eat away at all our money : - ( *****if you have n't get anything nice to say ; do n't say anything at all*****
 that 's a pathetic excuse ; colour should never ever come into it ; why would a white person deserve more money ; that 's absolutely ridiculous ! i wish you be get pay the same a them : - ( *****if you have n't get anything nice to say ; do n't say anything at all*****
 go for it sandeep ; cut out the middle man : - ) *****if you have n't get anything nice to say ; do n't say anything at all*****
 that be why we be get 3 or more time the salary ; we be not late to work ; not sick day all the time . pride in our work . and a stated quality of work.. i have work in 4 country where it position be for only western . when they have local or asian in the job it all go to crap so to say ; i be hire to clean the place up and set it back on track . the procedure be in place but the asians or local where too lazy to follow the path . safety be one of the main issue ; accountability and have the work complete not just have the box tick . i be happy they employ asians here ; it make u guys look good . so thank you for your poor quality of workmanship and organization skill ; you qualification may be high on paper.. but thats as far a it go . again . thank you rules be a guideline for intelligent people ; but they must be adhere to by idiot .
 @ miss pakistan ; i do n't know we 've meet ! ! ! yes i 'm jobless ; i live @ home with my parent ; you forget to add ; live off them as well & basically waste my time on the internet 24/7 ; spot on ! you 'd put sherlock holmes to shame with your investigative skill ... nonetheless ; this be a public forum & we 're all entitle to our opinion ; i 've state mine above ; simple ... btw ; nice try ; but no i 'm not take the bait ... 'cos you 're not worth it *wink* ! ! keep @ it though ; never know when i might take it & you could actually justify your pathetic excuse for a life ... have a good one !
 wage accord to nationality ? ? i be wonder why the european expat be be pay quadruple the salary of asian who have the same or even more experience and education ? ? ? at least thats the way it be in my work place .
 to be individualistic ; ; ; which be not the case at all in the east ; ; ; this allow westerner to make an informed decision on the spot ... and westerner come in all colour ; i be not narrow the field to white ; ; ; ; like it ; lump it ; do what you want with it ; but it the truth ; ; ; i be just be objective ... .
 what be a westerner ? someone who be from europe ; us ; canada etc . ? or someone who come from a developed country ? there be many of u go around whom be pay salary that be the same a local hire or asian hire also in many country ! do not think it be fair to generalise that westerners get pay more for everything . it depend on the job and scope that you be involve in . also bear in mind ; even though qatar be personal income tax free ; some expat still have to pay tax or other in their home country which also account for high pay .
 ... ca n't afford to spend a lot of time during the day on ql - too much work and responsibility ... and that 's just one reason . for once i have to agree with jackfrost : quote : 'i have work in 4 country where it position be for only western . when they have local or asian in the job it all go to crap so to say ; i be hire to clean the place up and set it back on track . the procedure be in place but the asians or local where too lazy to follow the path . safety be one of the main issue ; accountability and have the work complete not just have the box tick . ' he need some work on his english skill but i have to agree with him . my husband have be work overseas for over 30 year now and the responsibility will only be give to somebody who can take the shit the position make you go through and actually deal with it . you need to be firm ; have capacity to argue the necessary point and leadership personality . and unfortunately there be a lot of people who lack these requirement .
 really fair ... . if it do then there would no poor or rich and just same stature in life . we just need to accept the fact and live with it `` we can not change the past ; we only learn from it ''
 western people be first class nationality regardless their educational background ... that be why you can not find here in me an american office boy ... .. < a href= '' http : //photobucket.com/images/d % 20gray % 20man % 20gif '' target= ''  '' > < img src= '' http : //i519.photobucket.com/albums/u357/kamiishu/timcanpy '' border= '' 0 '' alt= '' timcanpy pictures ; images and photos '' / > < /a >
 ... of 'pay for nationality ' . the labour law of qatar be primitive and pre industrialization practice have continue to date . companies need to realize that the world have move forward . the logic behind this practice be not ignorance a many would think ; it be more of a feeling of apply economics around cost of living in the country of origin and extrapolate it to arrive at the salary figure . this have be take directly from saudiaramco . source : - a study conducted by friedunicorn - vol i ( september ; 1999 )
 i want to tell all my indian friend that if these idiot want to spend their money by pay four time whatever a white skinned drunkard racist braggart be worth ; why should we mind it ? it 's not that if they do n't pay them ; that money will come to u . let them pay peanut and enjoy monkey 's work performance . nothing in this world be unfair . there be always a way of get thing even . are you nut ? ... ... no doubt i be crazy about you !
 sun26872 - you 're the one come across a a racist in your post . how many time do you need to be tell ? they 're not all white ; they come in all colour ! and they do n't all drink ; - ) you should n't blame the people be pay ; you should blame the people who be pay : - ) *****if you have n't get anything nice to say ; do n't say anything at all*****
 can we really class canadians a westerner ?
 is anyone here an employer who could answer the question why hire more expensive europeans rather than the cheap asians ?

 these discussion invariably lead nowhere . the bottom line be that we all sign contract that we be happy with . so why worry about what the other guy be earn ?

 ghandhi and nehru be both educate at uk university and look what they go on to achieve ... it be a never end discussion sandeepkadian and although some company here do not discriminate others do for some reason . so while some company be willing to pay more for 'westerners ' some people will feel aggrieved . however i would like to make 10 time my salary that i could get back home like some of the asians that work here !

 i will give you an example that might show you a reason why let say filipinos as mention in this thread be earn little bit less than other nationality : check this address ; or else read below my comment to one filipina lady who envy others who get more than her husband : http : //www.qatarliving.com/node/825227 x be a civil engineer from manila work in w consturction company and earn 5000 usd per month . y be a civil engineer from us work in w construction company and earn 7500 usd per month . both x and y have 13 year experiance in thier field . why x earn 5000 usd and y earn 7500 usd per month ? discrimination ? my opinion be : - x need to work in w construction company for 5 year to save money for buy a house back home in the philippines . - y need to work in w construction company for 15 year to save money for buy a house back home in the us . - x have one son only who go to z university ( one of the best well know expensive university in the philippines ) where the fee be 30 000 peso ( 2300 qr ! ! ) per year . - y have one son also who go to g university ( which be one of the humble small university in california ) where the fee be 20 000 usd ( 73 000 qr ) . - x have a wife work in kuwait with one son only and a mistress in manila and a gf in qatar . he have to support himself only and maybe send some gift for his son from time to time . - y have a wife who be take care of 6 child back home and he be the only one responsible for the whole family . - if x be single and would like to get marry ; it wo n't cost him more than let say 100 000 peso ( 7600 qr ) for one of the best wedding in a luxarious cruise in the ocean . - if y be single and originate ; but a muslim ; he can not get marry with less than 100 000 usd ( 365 000 qr ) due to how expensive be wedding in the us ; hotels ; wedding planner companies ; the mahr ( might reach million ) which be suppose to be give to the wife a a gift to buy all what she need and would love to have . many empployers know these fact and many others when recruit staff . if any of u be not satisfy with his job ; then he good go straight home ; or be it only jelousy and envy ? for what ? although his income be more than yours ; most probably you get good life than him back home . better house ; your kid be enrol in good school and university ... etc so please enough envy .
 be how much you have negotiate your salary ? i have one main principle regard this story : you be ask for an amount . if you be receive what you have ask for ; why be you complain . if the offer be low ; why have you accept it ? on the other hand i know a lot of indians or iranians that be pay well than me . so ; maybe be not the nationality . each of u consider himself the most beautiful/handsome ; the smart ; the most skilled etc . person . maybe be not true ; have you think about this ? ?
 laurana ; romania come below india and iran in the qatari hr guideline for salary allocation .

 shahzad it 's just human nature . if i be pay high than the westerner at the same post ; i wo n't see a problem and will justify it someway or another . they be do the same but i expect the status quo to remain a it be and i have make peace with it . < a href= '' http : //s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/ ? action=view & current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg '' target= ''  '' > < img src= '' http : //i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg '' border= '' 0 '' alt= '' photobucket '' > < /a >

 if you know my salary ; jackfrost ; you will get a frostbite . i be agree with everyone that if you have sign a contract ; you should n't complaint . likewise ; i maintain that europeans and americans work here be of inferior quality than their asian counterpart ; but i do n't have a problem with that too because their salary do n't come from my account . europeans be very good only in one aspect that they can convince people of their lies.but i personally consider a great quality to be a convincing liar because nothing succeed like money . i wish we asians learn to stop work hard and start convince people of our leadership quality and individualism . but then who will do the real work ? are you nuts ? ... ... no doubt i be crazy about you !
 i have see this incident in one of the renowed compnay here . they do not have any audit on that . how much company pay to whom and pay for what even to contractor they be not pay equal .
 quoting sun : 'europeans be very good only in one aspect that they can convince people of their lie ' . they do n't need to do that a their professionalism speak for itself .
 ok who want to bet a month 's salary with me that this pink advertising campaign which be irritate everyone be design by either american or european . < a href= '' http : //s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/ ? action=view & current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg '' target= ''  '' > < img src= '' http : //i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg '' border= '' 0 '' alt= '' photobucket '' > < /a >
 right aluminar and we have to work harder to get atleast somethin call salary which all go on the 5th of every month .
 i would disagree and suggest that it 's probably a lebanese outfit..
 it depend on the company ; and the contract . in my company ; the position dictate the salary and there be some `` wiggle room '' in negotiate a high salary or benefit if you bring something spectacular to the table ( like great negotiate skill ; i guess ) . i do n't know how it be elsewhere ; but i guess my question be : if you be so unhappy with your contract ; why do you sign it ?
 people who complain why others get more than them be usually social climber who ca n't eat back home ; and once they come here they forget about thier origin and start compare themself with others . why and why ? to make it short ; if you do n't like it ; get the hell out of here and go somewhere else . thats it .
 wage accord to nationality ? ? i be wonder why the european expat be be pay quadruple the salary of asian who have the same or even more experience and education ? ? ? at least thats the way it be in my work place .
 damn.. you sound just like mrs. expat there : o (
 that 's a reality that we should accept..
 remember the white population have always be the bos ; the asian have always be the worker ; take it or leave it ; go home and get bread crumbs.. but doo tell me a i would love to get frostbite ... . too affraid hay ... think so li rules be a guideline for intelligent people ; but they must be adhere to by idiot .
 f everyone get pay the same them the asians would take all the nice accommodation in west bay and then where would all the westerner live ... ...
 from what i know sabrang yes.. my uncle ; a mr. singh get pay the same amount a any mr. wright and mr. wong work at his level . he work for reliance and have quite a few westerner in his department.. < a href= '' http : //s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/ ? action=view & current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg '' target= ''  '' > < img src= '' http : //i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg '' border= '' 0 '' alt= '' photobucket '' > < /a >
 shahzad - not worth a reply if you ca n't even spell my username right . see where the difference lie ?
 alumnar ... ! ! right but i think when it come to name . there be no dictionary lady . now you see where the difference lie ... ..
 i wont allow her to work a her salary be too low . she get good money back in her country ; but here ; ; forget it baby.. i get 10 time her salary . so why should she work here ... our choice.. same a it be your ; if you dont like it ; dont take it ; ; dont complain to u her ; ; we have 4 word if you dong like it ; ; piss off back home rules be a guideline for intelligent people ; but they must be adhere to by idiot .
 your provider . stop be envious ; hasad will deprive you fragrance of jannah abu tharr may allaah be please with him say : `` i hear the messenger of allaah sallallaahu `alayhi wa sallam say : `when forty-two night be pass ; allaah send an angel to the nutfah ( embryo ) and he give it shape ; form it hearing and sight ; it skin ; flesh and bone . then he say : `o lord ; male or female ? ' then your lord decree whatever he will and the angel write it down . ' '' [ muslim ] another hadith `` each one of you come together in mother 's womb for forty day ; then become an 'aalaqah ( clot ) for a similar period of time . then he become a mudhghah ( chew lump of flesh ) for a similar length of time . then allaah send an angel to him ; who be command with four thing . it be say to him : write down his deed ; his provision ; and whether he be doom ( destine for hell ) or bless ( destine for paradise ) . then the soul be breathe into him . ' '' al-bukhaari
 at the end of the day if you sign on the dotted line ; it mean you be happy to work for that amount of money ; no use look into other people pocket . we all make choice and have to live it .
 wage accord to nationality ? ? i be wonder why the european expat be be pay quadruple the salary of asian who have the same or even more experience and education ? ? ? at least thats the way it be in my work place .
 either way you 're still not the bos ; -p
 racism ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! people may try to be politically correct here but that 's what it is.. anyone of you who do n't think this be because of your passport be welcome to send me a message and i will show them the power of the colour of the passport ; atleast at 50 place in a single day in qatar.. get real people ... . stop pretending that racism has gone away ! ! ! ! ! !
 the color of the passport may be the first selection criterion ( we all agree that this be wrong and subjective ) but i hope that most of the case the evaluation of skill ; competence ; education and experience will be the determine factor ! i be obviously refer to lead positions !
 laurana ; i be tease you in response to the way you refer to 2 country ; )
 its not racism ; it may be nationalitism to create a new word but they be people with western passport who be non-white that earn 'western ' money . it may be wrong but you sign the contract when you come so it be your decision . maybe go home and negotiate good for your next contract and if they do n't give you what you want ; then do n't come .
 @ dohadiesel ; eh ? be n't you on the wrong thread about this ? ! ... there 's a lot more choice in singapore than there be here ; a for the price ; since you 're live there & i have n't be there for a good few month now ; your beer will be cheap in qatar than it be in singapore & i stand correct ... there you go ; yipee ! ! cheap beer ; '' rasvegas '' awaits your imminent arrival ! ! ! ... this little boy have something you might want to ponder ; just like you live in singapore & know more about the price of a pint than i do ; i live here ; you do n't & if you think the cheap pint be go to make up for all the shit one have to deal with here ; think again my friend ... we all must give up something to gain something ; such be life ; there 's no dodge it ... so yes ; you 'll get tax-free pay & the pint be cheap but unless you plan to turn into a rag alcoholic on the grog 24/7 ; i do n't see how that will significantly affect your life here ... however ; there will be a lot you 'll be give up that you take for grant in singapore ... essential difference here my friend ; i 've live in both place in question ; well live in one ; currently live in the other ; you on the other hand ; have only live in one ; so it 'd be prudent to reserve judgement before actually come & live here do n't you think ? ... sometimes one can learn a lot from observe kid *wink* ! ! ... have a good one ! ...
 i can take it even if it be for real . my point be just : `` if you do n't like it who 's keep you here ? there be two full list for every of u regard pro- or anti- working a an expat . we be the sole responsible for our act and decision . i could work in germany for almost the same money a here . part of my decision be to gain some me experience and to live in a more quite environment . i be not sure 100 % it be the wise thing but i be not complain about it.. anyhow ; nice to meet you . hope you be enjoy the life here ... : )
 laurana ; honestly ; after all the professional frustration i 've be through here ; the only reason that retain me in this country be the money ! i can ensure you that me experience be not an asset and it be often see a a disadvantage when you 'll try to reintegrate the western job market . it be well know in the west that the professional standard in the me be very low . there be several reason ; just to name a few : blind localization and promotion of unqualified ; non-competent and uneducated local people in lead position ; low work-force salary ; non-existent real hr policy ; etc ... nobody be motivate here to pursue a career a all know that wo n't happen ... and so many more ... in summary this be not a normal country where hard work ; innovation ; leadership and result be rewarded accordingly . this be a country where the wealth pour out of the soil ; regardless people be hard working or be passive and do the minimum to get the most ... the second scenario be the actual reality and the local be to lazy or to incompetent or the hopeless to control this disgrace .
 i have n't see your comment before come here ... .. i agree with you . but now i will finish what i have start . after that ; we 'll see ... ..
 hai all ; u know ; 30 % of microsoft staff be from india ; ... ... ... .. only the matter ; our be great ; but ur people have resource ; thats all
 wage accord to nationality ? ? i be wonder why the european expat be be pay quadruple the salary of asian who have the same or even more experience and education ? ? ? at least thats the way it be in my work place .
 so that be why microsoft vista be crap and windows 7 give the black screen of death ? you be not help the indians case here ... .
 agree with my exile friend ( hope i can call you a friend ) . it be not racism per se but rather a nationalism ; pasportism or perhaps jawaazsafarism ( please correctt my arabic ) . in many company mr tendulkar will get the same package a mr collingwood eventhough he just get his british passport last week . however without an australian passport mr afridi will not get the same a mr ponting despite the fact that he have live ; study and work all his live there . oh well ; in the end no one force u to sign that dotted line and no one ( i assume ) hold our passport and prevent u to say goodbye . cheers sk
 on a general level ; westerner seem to be able to demonstrate good level of leadership and trouble shooting . ( just see how many country be there in the west that be poor/under developed/developing compare to asia/africa . and it not that they have an advantage of natural resource or climate over others ) they can also sell themselves well . they also tend to grasp the big picture well ; compare to the asians who excel in specialise in a particular discipline of study . but then ; this be only a generalisation . this be not to say there arent any asian who cant do the same . whether you look at mittal/tata/sony etc and what they have achieve in the west ; the asians who work at high profile job in western country or the iim/iit graduate who be almost completely recruit by western company ; there be enough proof for asian talent and capability . but the issue be that ; due to the problem intrinsic to the demographic of asian population ; there be quite a sizeable chunk of the population who have not be fortunate enough to get the same kind of education and exposure that their more fortunate counterpart could attain . this particular section ; which be quite sizeable ; tip the balance when it come to the general world view of the quality of asian workforce . also ; i be not quite sure how it work out in the west . do they pay less for asian employee ; like here in the middle east ? if not ; that be another pointer ; which could tell u that the workforce from asia that end up in gulf ( that include yours truly ) be somehow the one that couldnt make it in their own home or in the west . it could also mean the me perception of asians have a hand in this . before accuse anybody of racism in this matter ; what the asians should think about be ; what exactly weigh in favor of the westerner and how to make the same factor work for them . its not skin ; it more than passport ; it the brand that have be create around it . like how sony make it in the west.morita know how to combine creative ; cost-effective engineering ( their core philosophy ) with product marketing and brand creation.end of the day ; it about brand creation . as much a i have see brilliant manager from west ; i have also see one who have reach that position simply by virtue of their passport . that be what you call brand value . ( not say that there arent local/asian manager who have be lucky in a similiar way ; for them it other reason ) have we reach a place where we be ready to launch that brand that would do half the selling for u ? till then ; asians will have to put up with less pay . coz like everything ; one day ; `` this too shall pass ''
 my god i bet you have have heap of good quqlity job in the past with your education ; where be asia.. wher be teh middle east.. all the same..ok i wil hire you.. now go make me some tea
 estong ; if certain western be offer what certain asian country pay their citizen ; i do n't think that you would have a single one of those westerner work here . this country be not a country where we settle here with our family for good ; it just a base camp ; to make some money to fuel our life back home ; and that we all know have different cost . not say that this be correct but it one of the factor that me do what they do and get away with it !

 for a racecar it will make a difference ; for you -nothing . the advantage of nitrogen in tire be that the airpressure will raise less than with air when you drive fast .
 i have it before on my previous car and it really help on the tire ; especially during summer ; because this nitro air will help to cool your tire.if you want nitro air on your tire ; q tyres in salwa road have it ... ... keep it cool ... ..
 hi.. i be use this nitrogen in my car 's tires.. really it be good.. i use it because i travel alot with my car it keep the wheel cold in summer.. hardly increase or loss in pressure during drive and with time.. goodluck
 n2 ( nitrogen ) be the stabil gas will not change the composition when receive heat . normally in summer the road be litle bit hot the friction between road and tire can change the composition of normal air in side tire . if you will make along journey or you want to make race recommend to pressurise with nitrogen but ensure quality of tire in excelent condition .

 qatar mosque pray how be the praying time announce ? do they announce the time from a public speaker so everyone can hear ?
 inside each mosque there 's a mic . the imam or the personne in charge make the first call to allow people to get ready after few mn he make the second call and the prayer begin .
 jani what be that suppossed to mean ? world affair and his nationality dont really have much to do with what he be ask .  `` diplomacy be the art of say 'nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - will rogers ''
 if you 're few meter away from the mosque you can here the adhan ( call for pray ) do by the muezzin ( one who call for pray ) and after few minute istiqama ( stand up for pray ) . < img src=http : //www.wonderfulinfo.com/funny/actualphotos/zidaneheadbutt.gif >
 it 's already very nice to him to ask about it . your comment be a nonsens.why do you post it in first place ... .
 brainless guy like jani3 give islam a bad name . pekkier post a question ; which to me seem very genuine . he probly have very little knowledge about islam . jani3 ; first read carefully pekkier 's q . then reply . instead of post dumb reply and scar someone who be interested in islam .
 we pray 5 time aday each prayer time differs on daily basis accord to the day or night lenghth ( the difference may be 1 minute every day `` more or less '' ) the timing be avilable everywhere : on the net ; on athan software or in the calendar in a small table in everyday 's paper . the mo'athen who be responsible for make athan which be cosidered a the official announcement of prayer time thae mo'athen make the athan in the mic . at the specific time . then after a pre-determined time he make iqama which be the announcement for people who come to the masjid after athan to stand up for the prayer the time between athan & iqama be vary between 5 to 25 minute accord to the prayer e.g : fajr ( dawn ) 25 ; maghhrib ( sunset ) 5 ... ..etc .
 the only reason i 'm ask be because i 'm unfamilar with the islam culture and the religion . i just want to get a idea of how the prayer time be set because i do n't want to cross path with anyone during that time . you see ; i 'm move to qatar in may and i think it would beneficial to me to know at least the basic of islam . since islam require the follower to pray five time a day ; i be wonder if it troublesome for someone who be not islam to be sound asleep during the pa call out .
 so it be all about sleep ! ! do n't worry it be not very loud and if : it wo n't take more than 3 minute ! and u will be awake in 3 prayer at least ! ! happy dream

 watch out for those `` tax free dollar . '' you still owe tax in the us and if you be canadian you have to divest of all property and financial tie in order to qualify for tax free status . and yes ; 25 % be consider fair ; if not minimal . mandi
 yes ; i be divest ; so all $ will be tax free . however ; i be recently offer a job in saudi for half the gross i be currently earn ( consultant ) ; and they do n't budge in negotiation . i be hop that qatar have deep pocket ; or it wo n't be worth it . so ... i 'm think that go in with a start position of current gross plus 25 might be a little extreme ; give the regional remuneration .
 oh yes ; i be very western and very white . may i ask how you come by your advice ?
 25 % plus plus have be the standard package for westerner for hamad medical corp and for the six american university in qatar . well ; with the exception of texas a & m which offer very competitive salary in the us plus 30 % . we 've be in medical in the gulf for ten year now . feel free to pm me . mandi
 physician contract negotiation does anybody have any pearl regard physician contract negotiation ? thanks for your thought .
 hi ; be a canadian trained specialist family physician do excellently here and be look for opportunity in qatar due to family situation . it be really disappointing . can someone help with contact . i read the post above . there be no way they 'll pay 20-25 % above what i make here . thanks asmeralda
 no ; the private clinic wo n't pay anything and you can see why when you look at their fee . compared to the west ; medical care be vey cheap here . the only place that may pay western rate for western physician be hmc ( if they recruit you ) and aspetar . mandi
 i be not a md but what i know you worth way more than that ... you be sacrifice to change your life style and cross atlantic ... .noo.noooo do n't settle with less or you gon na regret it ... .oooo yeah
 thanks for your thought accolade .

 poor button get nearly carjack in brazil.. it be go to the last race ; ca n't see alonso win from 5th on the grid .
 is there any place/cafe/club where formula - 1 racing be show today ... ? ?
 keep my finger cross for any of the red bull driver to win the championship .
 if redbull have to win ; this be their year ; coz i really doubt they ll get this close next season.. its good for f1 if there be more competitor than jus the mc larens and ferraris
 f1 - who will win the title ? two race to go - everything to play for . murray walker be probably lose for words.. the brazilian gp today . alonso could win the title today ; but i would doubt it . i see it go to the last race . who do you want to be champion this year ? heart say alonso ; but would love to see the red bulls triumph..
 down to the last race where alonso can finish 2nd and still win the title.. webber under pressure now..
 it will be interesting . red bull side with vettel and webber ca n't be happy . not simple for alonso . red bulls easily outpace the ferrari . let 's hope that mclaren can help alonso in abu dhabi .
 is n't it ?
 1 - it easy to get it ; it take time though 1-2 week ; even if you have one in your own country . 2- depends on the model and condition 3- yeah they be but most of them be garbage . and the good one cost too much . rid in traffic be suicide however ; qatar have ; without a shadow of a doubt ; the worst traffic in the world . all they like to do be blame other nationality for be bad driver while it them who contribute to it . i have motorcycle here btw ; but only ride at night well after 11 usually . cause yeah ; car driver be depressingly bad here . they be usually surprise when they see a motorcycle and dont know how to react to one near them . they will turn without look ; get into the fast lane and drive 20 below the limit ; stomp on the brake and come to a virtual stop at the speed camera . i can go on and on but i dont wan na stay here all night to describe just how horrible car driver in qatar be .

 kindly re-phrase ur question..
 eat..kitchen/restaurant socialize.. fb/ql : d
 clever response .
 there be load of place to go . but if you be on your own they be not much fun . i guess the easy response would be somewhere like the qube night club at ramada . you may at least bump into people and get chat at the bar there .
 irish pub ; pearl lounge ; qube ; waterhole ; paloma etc.. for socialise
 thursday evening/night ? any suggestion on place to go eat/socialize ?
 seems a win in the cricket give 'certain ' indians *cough cough imtiaz4u* a bit of courage ; - )

 the pearl have some nice restaurant by the way . not the nightclub at the marriott ; i mean the pearl . bit pricey but you can get a nice bottle of wine and sit in dubai-esq surroundings ; nice atmosphere and food in some place be nice . thought i should contribute something to here other than sarcasm .
 thanks qhris . some wine and a walk around the water sound like it could be a lot of fun ; actually .

 u can go to corniche ; boat ; museum ; family park .
 departure lounge at the airport
 make sure the lounge serve booze though
 the new museum of islamic art be worth a look . after that go to golf club for a beer & a burger .
 bring them in the shopping malls like city center ; villagio and behind hyatt plaza aspire park zone and doha zoo . for a long drive go to alkhor or dukhan..there 's a lot that you and your family will go together .
 cultural village villagio souq waqqif pearl
 too cold and windy to try anything outdoor ; specially for baby .
 how about explore the unexplored area around the industrial area . will be one hell of a memorable experience
 pearl qatar or villagio

 wow ... where do i start ... haha give u some more information ; what year ? model ? from the dealer or 2nd hand ? then ; i can tell you more !
 not a good buy . i would never recommend it even a a second car for off road activity .
 all ammrican car have bad resale value in qatar . you should expect to loose around 30 % to 35 % on the cost of the car in the first year .
 i have a jeep not so long ago and i please to say 'goodbye '
 hasan be right on the resale value . the 4-door wrangler should do you fine a a daily driver and work out for camp trip . i guess you get ta love the car if you 're go to buy an old one . either way ; good luck find a car that suit you !
 id watch out if i be you in regard to the resale value for sure in addition ; i prefer the old engine ; 2004 and down if im not mistake . the 4.0 ? the new 3.7 feel so tie up while floor it . dam all the eco constraint theyre enforce on the big boy car nowadays conclusion : if you want it for an everyday car ; then dont want it that much ; you could do good if you be into pop the bonnet every now and then and enjoy it ; go for it ( preferably old ) a mention in previous thread
 would you recommend jeep wrangler a a good buy ? any good and bad experience with jeep wrangler ?
 i follow carefully report and review on car regard durability ; maintenance and reliability . to be honest ; dodge and chrysler ( include jeep ) be among the least reliable car around . a recent study by forbes in the usa show that these manufacturer along with gmc top their list of least reliable car . a list which no japanese or korean manufacturer make ! interestingly ; car manufacture by ford for the past five year be among the most reliable . jeeps have be well know for their mountain and dune climb capability ; but when it come to road driving ; you 'd better slow down before buy one and see all other alternative . a ford explorer may be a good choice if you be look for an american car at the same price tag ( or even cheap ) than the jeep . but for qatar ; if you can ; get your self one of these : 1- toyota prado . 2- nissan pathfinder or x-terra 3- mitsubishi pajero 4- honda pilot they be the least to lose at reselling by order . they be also very reliable and have a large range of option to choose from .
 overplay.net prices be on the site ; think i pay 30 dollar for 3 month or something . works well and can log on to any country ; handy for u irish - uk and irish tv player .
 hi ; i would recommend use http : //www.roadwarriorvpn.com the service be excellent and guy be very responsive . them them out !
 ive be use www.laptoptelly.com in qatar early on in the year . have pretty good speed and quick link to bbc & itv . think be fiver a month or something .
 ask mr. google ; there be lot of review online . just find time read it . hth

 facial cream for whitening dear friends ; could you all please kindly advise me some facial cream or lotion or soap for face whiten ? ? for whiten face ? ? please kindly advise me . best regard ; charles
 you can use also magic cream and astringent during night time or daytime also but not expose to sunlight when apply this stuff
 i know of one special formula and it effective . dont know if the ingredient be here in qatar but i can teach you .
 my friend ; the best is go to dermatologist and examine your face sensitivity . you may apply a lot of facial cream and your face might react on it differently . some are cheap and some are expensive but must be sure first of your skin properties before applying on it .
 try ... tea tree from body shop
 you be quite a brave man to ask this question . however ; since you be a qatari ; i do n't think that there be any cream that can turn you inot an ammerican .
 all you have to do be to take ur resume ( cv ) to hamad hospital human resources department they will gv u a form to fill then u submit . wish u good luck cheer ... .

 thanks chmb . so it mean i 'd be good off bring from the states ? mainly because it would be cheap ; be that correct ?
 if you get a phone from australia ; it be factory unlocked ... . i guess thats the best option . and a new 3gs 32 gb should cost you just qr3100 brand new .

 also you can use wifi to get skype application and use skype call for free . the new palm be pretty cool too
 @ crazyjoy ; find me a 32gb factory unlock 3gs in qatar and i 'll buy 10 . the cheap i 've see so far be starlink at 3 ; 800 and also see them for 3 ; 100 in hongkong . if you buy it for 3 ; 100 then there 's delivery ; risk of custom tax ; and/or damage . best case it would be 3 ; 400 to your door : ) anyway ; i recommend get an iphone factory unlock rather than unlock it because everytime you update you will have to worry . if you want to unlock it just use ipwn .  < a href= '' http : //blog.iloveqatar.net '' > < img src= '' http : //iloveqatar.net/images/mrqql.png '' border= '' 0 '' > mr . q 's blog - a qatari 's view on qatar. < /a >

 britexpat ; yes ; someone who be employ by a company here and on a seperate rp . employer / sponsor have nothing to do with marriage of employee . provided both bride and groom have valid rps in qatar ; the family court in qatar will only ask for a letter of approval from the father of the bride if he be not physically present in the court during the wedding ; and an attested/translated civic record or something that prove the bride be not marry . in addition to do a medical test and bring 2 witness to court ; there be nothing else to it . however ; keep in mind that the family court here will only marry a muslim male to a muslim or christian female . they will not carry out the marriage of the groom be not a muslim or if the bride be not a muslim nor christian . only one exception to this rule : female cabin crew work at qatar airways .
 yes ichwill i do get marry here accord to our religious rite and then have to get a formal one do at our embassy and submit the noc to my embassy and attest it . when i have my child here i have to submit a similar letter state i be sponsor by my company to hmc ... ..
 we have that do at a relative house here . it wasnt the entire ceremony a there be restriction to that and not possible to bring in a priest so it be a simple ceremony but we get registerd at the embassy legalise it .
 that clear a lot of thing . i be specifically talk about the qatari family court . some expat community in qatar have some kind of marriage official over here ; whether it be at their embassy or outside . in my case ; since my wife and i be of different nationality ; we could not get marry at the embassy .
 ichwill - some law in this country just amaze me . different rule for diff nationality for the same issue . at the end of the day it all boil down to money ... dont understand why they cant just take the cash and make thing simple ! ! ! !
 as far a the family court be concern only one law apply to all nationality . they genuinely do not care what our nationality be . they only care about religion ... i be not say that be any good .
 ichwill - yeah that too ... .case to case scenario actually . in this instance yes it religion but there be many other issue pertain to visa etc and every nationality have something diff to produce . believe me the ppl sit at the counter themselves have differ opinion on what papaers need to be submit for what ... .recent hair raise exp with my labour card ... . & ^ & & %

 shop rite ; spinneys and the supermart at parco mall ( forget the name ) .
 best supermarket in doha ? i usually shop at megamart ... it 's expensive but the produce be good than other place i 've be ; and they have a wide selection of gourmet food . has anyone try the greenbox or know of other supermarket with good produce ?
 all supermarket in doha be poorly manage . too many time i read `` sorry ; we be out of stock . '' guess ; they 've never hear of proper planning . bloody amateurs wherever you look .
 the greenbox stuff be pretty good . you can have locally grow ( i think ) and import . the good thing about them be that they take care that their produce be not leave in the heat and immediately distribute ; so it really be fresh .
 spinneys appear to treat their staff well or at least provide them with adequate training a most of them be very sociable ; friendly and appear to genuinely smile at you . something new in doha !
 plus ; ask for advice on the location of a product at your peril ... .staff take no pride in their job and do n't bother learn what the store even sell ; so ask where something be ; and be prepare to get a blank stare unless it be generic ( who ask where obvious thing be ; anyway ? )
 the greenbox be not a shop . you can order from them and they will deliver your order to your house . http : //www.thegreenbox.me/
 i have just be on the website and will give them a try ; i have really miss fruit and veg that be fresh or at least edible . thanks for start the thread ajnelson hope you get something out of it as well .

 carrefour ; spinneys and foodworld choice . i really enjoy shop at foodworld choice . they really have a very friendly and clean shopping environment . and their customer service be excellent which you can not find in other supermarket like lulu and safari . although some item be expensive they make it sure they have the high quality of the product.and they have import item from uk and usa .

 hi johanna and welcome . maid 's salary run from 1200 qr on up for live-in ; 25-35 qr an hour for live-out . come to the mums in doha or the expatwoman coffee morning at villagio and you will have all your question answer ! mandi
 maid 's salary run from 600 qr on up for live-in ...
 not for westerner bleu they corrupt the market !
 hi mandi thank you so much it will be great .
 people do n't get pay what they deserve they get pay what they negotiate . it may not be fair but it 's the truth
 400 $ be a bit too much . if you add to this 400 $ maid 's accommodation ; let 's say a room 3500qar ( 1000 $ ) ; then her food about $ 200 ; then her cloth ; etc ; about another $ 100-200.. ops..it come to over qar6000 ... than it turn that the office clerk make less then maid ? ... < i > < b > ********************* `` what lie behind u and what lie before u be small compare to what lie within u .

 i agree with you alumnar . you can not treat someone like a slave ... if you want a job do right you have to pay and look after them properly ... ..
 ... people seem to not realize that when they take somebody on and this person live with them ; this person become part of not only your household but also your family . you trust them with your life and belonging ; and most important with your child . that come at a price ; and the price i mention be very fair !
 i pay accord to experience ; competence and professionalism rather than nationality . mandi

 would be too hat to walk or sit in any place without a/c you and your family will spend all day in one of the malls and that be it
 do you know the summer here today it hell 47c here . arrrrrrrrrgh
 it would be very hot i guess.. and in the late summer month a lot of humidity for the icing on the cake ... ! ! ! this be my first summer here as well ... but thats what i hear from my friend here ; who be here for the past few year ...
 with 2 small kid ? good not ... .
 moving to qatar for the summer hi ; i 'm just wonder could someone tell me what it would be like for me with 2 small kid 2 move to qater for the summer ;
 people here move away in summer & u planning to move in here ? ? ? ! ! who initiate this idea ? ? ! ! : d wel..dont trouble yourself to get into more trouble here ... ..it be 48degrees yesterday & may reach above 50degree later ; ; nothing unusual for qatar !
 chooose some cold place ; qatar be not right place to visit in summer .
 it 's my partner idea he wrks there and want u to cum out for the summer to him i dont no what to do ; i have be there before on my own and with my old boy who be 6 year ; it be very hot when we be there alrite ; i did't like where we be stay out in alkor ; if we go for the summer we would be stay in doha ; i just dnt no what to do becoz my baby be only 8 month and be from ireland we be use to the rain ha ha ! ! ! !
 dear helena ; i m in doha since 15 day ; my family ( wife and my 6 y.o boy ; suppose to arrive on 15 day ) i be actually try to convive my wife to come as late a she will ; because the temperature be realy bad ( yesterady 48 on my area ) ... . prepare to suffer ... ...
 bring chiller if you do n't like hot water bath .
 bad idea ... a you say you have an 8 month old baby then it will be useless to spend summer here ... bcoz you will have to stay at home all the time with kid in the a/c ... secondly you stay in al-khor and it a boring place..atleast in doha city a person never get bored..anyways all of u give you our suggestion and the rest depend on you ... if you still plan to spend summer vaccations then you be welcome ... how long your hubby have be stay here ?
 thanks for all the answer ; he be there nearly 8 month ; i no it be go to be very hot thats what be put me off about go out for the summer with the kid ; anyways i 'm just go to have to make my mind up soon ha ! thanks for the help

 there have n't be enough case for them to collaborate statistic on which culture be more prone to be infect . an no ; i highly doubt asians ; or those who eat those type of food have any particular immunity to it . it be very similar to the common cold ; however because it be new ; no one have an immunity to it because no one have ever be expose to it before . the best you can do be eat healthily and provide your body with adequate nutrition so that your immune system be as strong a it can be to fight it off .

 to get family visa he needs to show his marriage certificate and other related doc . after marriage he can bring his wife on visit.after entering spouse name on passport . after his wife coming for visiting if he has qatar riyal 7000 he wil get family visa . as much as i know .
 a would-be wife can not be consider to have a family visa . after marriage ; only then that the immigration will consider his would-be wife under family status upon submission of the marriage certificate . your friend must wait then .
 dear proposer ; in normal case ; you friend will need to have a short wait where he complete the paperwork for his wife to join him . yes ; there 's a way if he want his wife to come along with him . his marriage be on june '09 ( ie the custom or social marriage ) . but he could go for a court marriage at an early date ; and be legally marry ( if not socially ) . he could then submit all the necessary paper and get his wife 's visa well in advance ( of course ; if he meet other criterion )

 to my understanding there be a sailing club in the ritz-carlton/ diplomatic club area . you might want to try it in there . as per jetskiing may be go aside to intercon and there you can rent a jetski either for 1/2 hr or 1 hr and have some fun . best of luck ... .regards
 when i visit doha i 've be at the sailing club and it be really cheap compare to european cost . for about 2000 qr per year you can access to the club and use the lasers and 470 boat . i suppose they can offer also lesson ; but with the quite wind that blow in doha it be really easy to learn . actually i hate the noisy and pollute jet sky ; so my suggestion be lear to sail and you will never live without . cheers from italy !
 good place to learn sailing and do watersports hi all ; i would like to learn sailing and do some watersports like kayak and jet sky . where be the best place in doha to enrol for such activity ? any idea of the fee ?
 sasuke ; where be that sailing club ? is the one at the diplomatic club or another one ?
 the doha sailing club be locate when you come from the mariott back to doha ; it be the first gate on your right on the mainroad ; immediately after the mariott roundabout . go down to the clubhouse & inquire there . ( big parking in front )
 i agree with other post the doha sailing club be great - nice idea to leave the jet ski at home

 thanx for the reply sir . i arrive in qatar last march 17 2007. just in case i dont have the noc ; can i still go this march 2009 ? tia
 no ; it be not from the date you enter qatar but from the date you officially leave . as you didnt cancel your rp that date will probably start 6 month after you leave the country a your rp will be automatically cancel if you be out of qatar for more than 6 month .  `` diplomacy be the art of say 'nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - will rogers ''
 you will most likely be ban from whenever ( if at all ) your previous sponsor cancel your visa ; which ; if you be there 8 month will probably mean he canceeled your visa in november/december07 so you still have a good year to go . < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/photos/b '' title= '' monotone mia by baldrick2dogs ; on flickr '' > < img src= '' http : //farm4.static.flickr.com/3389/3262305312 '' width= '' 240 '' height= '' 97 '' alt= '' monotone mia '' / > < /a >

 honestly - do n't bother call a they will never answer ! forget fax and email as well ! you have to go down in person to the animal resource department on airport road and talk to someone there . they 're open between 6.30am and 1.30pm sunday - thursday . if it 's one or two cat they will lend you trap that you can set ; trap the cat and take in before 10am for neuter . they can be collect the following morning and you can re-release them into your area if it 's a large population then they will probably arange to come and trap them themselves and release them .

 @ newtaxi : d hahahhaha i also quit for more than 4hrz : p now it time to ... .. : p ; - )
 yes ; i do ! but i sneak in a cigg or two in a week !
 no side effects at all !
 keep smoking and kill yourself ... and take others with you as well .
 have you quit smoke ? what side effect do you experience so far ?
 i smoke for almost 24 year and when my daughter ask me why i smoke..i ca n't provide any good reason why..so i decide to quit and i never regret it .
 i quite some time ago with cigarette smoking . side effect be minimal .
 i like girls who know how to smoke .
 i did.. side effect ? ? i divert into food.. now im turn into cow..
 i didnt smoke since yesterday.may be it the heat .dont feel like smoke anymore .
 the only thing you need to stop smoking be courage . give up on anything be not easy . but a brave heart guys/girls can stop smoking if they really want to . it be just a habbit which you engage with . and habbits can be change . train yourself . first prepare your mind . if your mind be healthy then anything be possible dude . i stoppped smoke . and i really feel great about myself . coz i be not slave of my habbits .
 be it open ?
 location please ... . ? ? ?

 the birdy ; you know that you be teach how to violate a law of qatar ? and you want this poor man to commit a crime ; and to push his pronsor to commit a crime too..
 may be it be a violation ; i agree . but denyng a person to bring his wife -- - also a violation of his human right . what i tell him be not a big crime . he be bring undrs the same sponsor .
 gotcha do you try search on the net before post ? ? i find this http : //wiki.answers.com/q/what regards ! !
 yes ; i search on net ; it be not clear ; in your link it show the meaning of arhan or arahan .
 to use the same source a the first answer ; but with the spell you give http : //wiki.answers.com/q/what means ruler ; but do not define origin ; which my early post suggest be aboriginal not islamic .
 beloved brother/sister ; there be no such thing a a 'muslim ' name ; for one be recognize a a believer in the sight of allah swt because of his belief and deed ; not because of his name . the meaning of this name be `` ruler '' and it 's origin be indian . and if one wish to name their child 'arhaan ' ; it would be a perfectly acceptable name in islam . if the question be 'is it a good name ? ' ; then we would advice that there be plenty of good name one may keep for their child .

 25 ; 000 one liner ! ! ! that 's one for me ; p
 personal . election be really good than appointment ! ... ... ..tsk ! tsk ! tsk ! ganun pala nangyari sa miting ng mga heneral ! ! ! ! ! ! `` do n't let a little dispute injure a great friendship ''
 dmigty - you 're more likely to get a response use the contact link . though i think your question have already be answer by everyone else .
 wait for further response ! i 'm talk about my letter to ql mods ; not this thread ! ... ... ..tsk ! tsk ! tsk ! ganun pala nangyari sa miting ng mga heneral ! ! ! ! ! ! `` do n't let a little dispute injure a great friendship ''
 that 's one more : p ( if only know it be this easy lol )
 ok ; my bad . did n't know you 'd write a letter to ql mods .
 i guess they do n't consider it worthy of a response ! i do n't think anyone work on ql full time ; so they probably only send a reply to those that really need one .
 editing/deleting comments lately i find out that author of thread can self regulate their thread . i mean ; the author can edit/delete unwanted comment a the author wish to ! is this true or a i understand it that only the moderators can do the editing and deletion of another person 's comment ! as i understand it also ; one can edit his/her own comment but never other 's comment ! does this policy hold true ?
 no . it 's respect to someone ask question . are you fun of just disregard query ? and by say nobody work fulltime ; be you insinuate that mods be not do their work with a little sense of responsibility ? it 's just just ! ! ! ! ! lol ! ! ! ! ! ! i do n't think so ! ! ! ... ... ..tsk ! tsk ! tsk ! ganun pala nangyari sa miting ng mga heneral ! ! ! ! ! ! `` do n't let a little dispute injure a great friendship ''
 chill out dude ! all i know be that ql be n't run a a business ; and the owner and mod all have their own life to lead outside of the website ; so it 's inevitible that some question go unanswered and some threads/classifieds go unmoderated . if it 's that important ask them again ; though personally i ca n't see that anything to do with ql can be that important .
 hahahahaha !
 or jungle zone in hyatt plaza ?
 yes ; as his visa is still active till january ; he can come back even if he has any other gcc country visa . but once he will be here definitely the company will ask as how he managed to get the visa but that is not a problem . so your friend can come any time before expiry of the rp . thanks

 britexpat.. 80 % of the curry house in the uk be run by bangadeshi . chingari have nice ambient . for value curry qutba in bin dirhem be nice !
 brit i have give up on curry a an idea in qatar . i have decide that it would be good to look for other food experience for my son while he be here . as the curry back home be well . so we have thai today ; and it 's go to be lebanese tomorrow .
 tb thats cuz you never listen ! ... bad tb ... . : - ( ( you take all our advice and finally eat on a banana leaf ! ! ! ... and cold food that that ! ... serve you right ! ... j/k ... .take cabbages advice and try spices . : - )
 i know i be bad . and yup i go against the advice . but the theme of the thread still seem to be ; that the curry be just as good ; if not well in the uk . and back home i live in a sleepy little city that have no thai ; no lebanese ; and no turkish restaurant . so it 's best to give him food experience he ca n't get back there .
 aryaas be mid level ... ..everyday food at low cost . and it 's mainly veg . but if you be in for a good diniing out experience i would n't choose it . there 's maaza ; they do a mean `` kadai chicken '' . there 's asiana ; not typical indian food ; but it 's ok. then there be shalimar for the banana leaf sadya . their butter chicken be also good .
 you will always be a slave ; a this be their policy here . buy a car ? no ; sponsor need . open a giro bank account ? no ; sponsor require . bring your wife ? no ; sponsor require . leave for a holiday ? no ; sponsor require . and so on and so on . the big disadvantage be that water cost twice as much a petrol . you sometimes wish you be a car .
 it be drinkable but not advisable .
 there be no random shooting or gunman on the loose .
 too bad you be only look at the dark side ; lol . climate would be a disadvantage - it 's really hot right now . but many expat have the ability to leave in the summer . climate be also an advantage - no snow and christmas dinner outside on the patio . i suppose that drinking water can be a problem depend on where you live . i drink the water out of the tap all the time . cars - disadvantage include absolutely insane driver although it have be get well . an advantage include cheap gas and the ability to buy a good vehicle than you probably have at home . social life - disadvantage - you probably will remain within your ethnic group ; i 've find it hard to mix and mingle with the qataris . on the other hand ; you will make excellent friend and have the time to socialize with them . vacation time - only an advantage here . we have almost triple the vacation time we have at home ; the money to go place ; and you do n't have to travel a far to go to exotic destination .
 it be ungreatfull for any body to say all this . you guy have come here not because you do not know the weather ; the rule or what ever ; the fact be all of u have come here because you earn so much more and you have high save potential and that be the only thing that bring you here . my friend you also be move from your home country to doha not for any thing but the money you be offer ; and now please understand to gain some thing you defenitely have to sacrifice some thing and i do not know what you sacrifice ; but it be all for money you come so just decide what you want . it be meaningless to have such debate on this subject . i be sorry guy ; i felt like tell the real fact .
 prescription for regular medication could anyone tell me how i go about get a prescription for medication that i need to take regularly . i move to doha in 10 day time ; i have search this site but can not seem to find the information i need . thanks louise
 you should consult a doctor fist and tell him about your medication . he/she will provide you the necessary prescription or advice .
 sorry for the spell mistake `` fist '' should be `` first ''
 you can consult any physician in any doha clinic ; and have yourself examine ; then they would write you the prescription that you need ...
 certain medication be control by prescription ; like anti biotics ; steroid and psychatric drug . most others you can avail over the counter ; if the drug be control you need to get a prescription
 even for control drug ; you ca n't have a permanent prescription ; you have to consult your physician everytime ( frequently at least once in 2 month ) to obtain presecriptions for regular medicine .
 lol ... !
 dont know exact soluton ; ; ; but hear that berrygoose be good for this ... avla ... . in hindi ... ... ... just eat them kacha .
 i also have the same problem couple of year back . i would suggest a very good homemade recipie which help me . first thing in the morning as soon a you get up ; squeeze one lime in a glass of warm water add a pinch of salt and drink on empty stomach ; do this every morning for at least 15-20 day you 'll start feel the difference ; for the time be apply some jogel gel ( available in any pharmacy ) on the ulcer
 my brother have it before and it be always come back ... my mom notice it be induce of a particular food he take ... so he avoid that food and it be now okey ... there be a powder call alum..you can place it in the ulcer area ... it will hurt so much that time then it will help cure the area fast ... before i do n't believe because i know that this alum be use cosmetically until one day i be desperate to find a cure and i try ... and now i be recommend it..
 why cant't people give a straight answer and recommend a good dentist ? ? suddenly everyong have a medical degree and give advice ... the gentleman ask for a good doctor not how to heal his ulcer . pm at your convienience and i will be happy to discuss your condition
 mouth ulcer i be since last 4yrs in doha and suffer with recurrent mouth ulcer . i consult many doctor here and india but no result.can anyone suggest good doctor for sp.treatment .
 i will try lemon remedy and ya i read about alum be effective on canker sore but alum ; omg . thanks for suggestion of all and pm ; but still i be search any answer if anybody suffer and consult right doctor .
 buy listerine mouthwash . gargle at least 4 time a day . within 2-3 day your mouth ulcer will be cure .
 best and simple answer be drink two glass of hot water ( equivalent to tea hot ) and drink ( sip by sip like tea ) in the morning empty stomach and in evening after meal before sleep evreyday as long a you can . 100 % effective i be a real sufferer but no more.. try mate ...
 nothing work or it be temporary ... i can bet you all ... drink hot water as hot a tea.. two glass in morning empty stomach and two glass in night after dinner ... and feel the difference

 avast
 microsoft essential . it 's free and update regularly .
 avg - you can download a full internet security trial for 30 day and then it default to the free version which be more than satisfactory ! have be use avg for nearly 10 year now and not a problem - very thorough in keep those hacker and viruses out ! norton in my humble opinion take up a lot of computer memory and like to stick it 's nose in everywhere include your internet browsing ! not to mention expensive ! it come free with my new desktop and i could n't delete it quick enough ! i think it do an all right job with anti-virusing but for me ; avg ! ! ! good luck
 i would say try all of the suggestion above and see which well ; you can sometimes keep 2 antivirus at once ; see which one perform good and get that : )
 should be plug and play .

 does anyone know the cost of have a baby at the al ahli ? i have ask the al ahli but the answer be unclear . has anyone have their child there ? if so how much do it cost you ? do they have a day rate for a delivery suit ?
 normal delivery be qr10 ; 000-12 ; 000 ; caeserean be qr12 ; 000-15 ; 000 . they charge per night and normally want the baby in for 2 night . if i remember rightly it be about qr1 ; 500 per night .
 well ; if ahli hospital be be cover by your insurance company then why u r worry about such thing .
 12000-18000 accord to my colleague who 's plan to deliver there . if ur baby need to go to icu ; u need to pay for that too .
 what ? they 're sell baby now ?
 what i heardfrom my friend relative be qr-6000/- for normal and qr-10000/- for cezzarene ... .other charge different bill ... .

 ..entry visa may be finish in one day..that be ; if the person do it have no other thing to do..but ; visa issuance to an applicant have so many requirements..are you sure it be only the visa you 're wait for.. ? ..have you receive a job offer.. ? ..as i previously state ; mine take only a week ( if i remember it right ) ..and then there be a mistake on the name printed..and then it take them less than a week to have it correct ...
 i have pretty much give them everything they need . i have already be offer the job and sign the contract . i be tell they be sort out my entry visa which be a 3-8 week process ; and when this be sort they would organise my flight to come to doha . so i 'm really not sure how it all work from here ...
 individual visa should n't take a long . i think if you have already sign the contract then there be nothing to worry about . relax ; hmc be not go to cheat you . they might have apply for a bunch of visa ; hence the delay . good luck .
 thank you for your response . it have now be over 3 month and be get very frustrating ! i be be kick out of my current job because they can no longer afford to keep me here any longer . 3 month for an entry visa and still count ! i can only imagine what more thing i have to do before they will fly me to qatar . is this normal ? every story i hear ; it seem the maximum one have to wait be 4 week for an entry visa !
 entry visa process hi everyone ; i 've be accept for a role at hmc and have be tell my entry visa be a 3-8 week process . it 's be almost 8 week now and i 'm concerned it will take much longer ; especially hear some of the story here ( 6 month to get a visa ! ) should i be concern and expect the process to take much long ?
 which kind of visa do hmc apply for ? be it visit ? business ? or work visa ?
 be you serious ? the ultimate measure of a man be not where he stand in moment of comfort ; but where he stand at time of challenge and controversy ... .martin luther king
 yes you can visit qatar in the month of june and you can renew your passport at your concern embassy . regards ; sm
 1 yes ; 1 no . ask your embassy for the correct answer .
 yes ; if you have existing visa on other country . no ; if you do n't have work visa/residence permit to your destination . if your visa be visit ; your passport should valid within 6 month .
 no you cant a any visit visa require a 6 month minimum validity on passport . if you 've have a us passport ; perhaps they would 've allow you with a short validity ( may be 4 month ) ; but otherwise no ...
 i dont think even a father ( legal ) can sponsor his daughter alone .
 why not marry again n then sponsor
 you can . the daughter be always under the father 's sponsorship until she get married ( even if she be 50 year old ) !
 father can sponsor for sure . anyways why ask these thing in ql ? ? ? ? you can directly apply the visa and know the outcome for yourself ? ? ? am i wrong ? ? ? ?
 can a separated father sponsor his daughter ? can a father sponsor his daughter if he be separate and his wife be not reside in qatar . is it possible ?
 offcourse father can sponsor ( resident permit ) for his daughter but he need to have a family status in qatar and if the daughter be unmarried and dependent on father then it be easy to sponsor . for visit visa no issue .
 i be expect the positive response.. @ salim000 ... what you mean by family satus..
 ofcourse ; not bad ; nice salary ! if ur in sale ; u vil b get incentive also ; any way ; u can get a partially furnished accomodation with in qr.5000/- ; n can save minimum qr.5000/month ; if ur not addict 2 other habit . best of luck ! ! !
 that be a good offer for sales job . i know some guy work a supervisors and managers ( sales & marketing ) who be not get that much . you can get executive bachelor accommodation for qr.2500/- and you have to consider other expense like food ; medicine ; communication etc . which will not be more than qr . 1500/-per month ( depend on you way of living ) . you can easily save good money .
 it ennough ; but also depend on which country you belong to
 which co. saar ; in sale it ; stun ! ! ! ! lucky man
 without accommodation it be a bad deal ... but it 's upon you either to go for less money or end pay ... ..

 exit permit is it mention in the exit permit the place where you want to go ? i mean be it state the place you be going.thanks .
 exit permit also show your name ; qid ; nationality etc . and not destination .
 onece you get the exit permit ; you be free to go anywhere outside qatar
 as per new way of issue exit permit it be not mention any destination . it use to be mention almost 2 yr ago . need to exit qatar thats all .
 exit visa mean you have non obligation towards any body in country you be gon na to exit & free to go any where the person 's want . it be issue in a name with visa number on which person come entrie the country . ( without show any destination where she or he be go )

 did you get that ; iryssa ?
 samsung omnia ... be very good since it come with a touch screen a all navigation hardware should be ... ..it also have 5mp camera ! ! ! the best thing about mobile phone gps be you can install other gps software other than the company provide gps free gps software be google maps & nav4all but garmin have the best `` look '' software although all the info provide be the same ! ! ! the free software do not provide voice assistance & do the route plan . free gps software : 1 . shows where you be in real time . 2 . shows your destination . so the only thing missing be the voice assistance . route planning be hardly required ... ... unless you plan to travel into the desert alone . buying garmin gps software cost $ 200 ... . almost a third the price of an entry level gps phone . doesnt make sense to buy it when there be free software !
 jackmohan ; i disagree 100 % the screen size on a mobile phone be just too small to be useful a a vehicle gps where you need 100 % concentration on the road without lean forward to see which way you be go on a 1.5 inch lcd ! yeah ; probaly fine a a back up for walk once you leave your car ; but for driving ; buy the right tool for the job ! < a href= '' http : //www.flickr.com/photos/b '' title= '' monotone mia by baldrick2dogs ; on flickr '' > < img src= '' http : //farm4.static.flickr.com/3389/3262305312 '' width= '' 240 '' height= '' 97 '' alt= '' monotone mia '' / > < /a >

 anti-bachelor day last eid i be shoo away from the corniche and prohibit entry to malls coz i be single . does anyone know what the anti-bachelor days/timings be during this holiday ?
 no it open for all . i just come from corniche there be no police petrol around and all the bachelor be have good time.but the police might get in the evening
 i read in the paper a few month back that their definition of a bachelor be and i quote `` a smelly poorly dress single man '' i save the article cause i could believe it actually say that . the best thing i would suggest be buy a small child 's coat and bring it with you when they stop you say you have to run out and get your kid 's ; who be in the mall with their mother ; coat .
 darude ... . thanks for the wrong info ... city center be on family day ... corniche there be no police ; but cid operative be there ... but i haven ' check villagio and the other mall ...  actually this be not anti-bachelors day ... it may be good call a anti-asian bachelor day ... 
 i just return from villagio . they reject some `` smelly ; poorly dress '' single . yes .
 magic.. it ok if they do not allow smelly people inside ... but for the so call `` poorly dress '' single ; what do u mean ? .. maybe thats the only thing that they can afford.. remember ; not everybody here in doha be earn that much to spend on fancy clothes.. the thing be ; during these mall family day ; mall authority be `` profile '' single people.. not all bchelors be restrict ... i know you know what i mean .
 it very true discrimination be rife here in qatar and it a shame because it these very people that keep this country functioning.. i myself have be challenge once on the numerous family day i have enter during to which i reply i be meet my wife and be let in immediately .
 sad ; but it 's happen in doha ... just go to the mall in good clothes and pray that the guard will let you in ... good luck ... .
 i think it qr300
 it be 500 and when the person or company you issue the cheque to will file police complain ; it will be on your record and you can not leave doha and you have to submit yourself to the court with all the evidence from the person or company that you have already settle your due .
 it varies from bank to bank .. from 100qr to 500qr ... which bank be you deal with ? ?
 penalty for returm check ? hi i would like to ask if anyone know how much be the penalty of a returned check ? thanks
 i think it be jail time . is n't it illegal to issue a cheque know you do n't have the fund to honour it ?
 haha u right tigabaguio . ask google.com < img src= '' http : //2.s01.flagcounter.com/count/fcppr/bg=00cc66/txt=000000/border=000000/columns=1/maxflags=1/viewers=3/labels=1/ '' height= '' 1 '' width= '' 1 '' / > < img src= '' http : //s01.flagcounter.com/count/fcppr/bg=00cc66/txt=000000/border=000000/columns=1/maxflags=1/viewers=3/labels=1/ '' height= '' 1 '' width= '' 1 '' / > < img src= '' http : //s01.flagcounter.com/map/fcppr/size=t/txt=000000/border=cccccc/pageviews=0/viewers=3 '' height= '' 1 '' width= '' 1 '' / >

 final exit i be work a a web developer with one company . my visa status be personal labour ( `` aamil shaksiya '' ) . this visa be under by boss 's brother . my boss promise me to change the profession of my visa ; but since 2 yr . he could n't make it . now i want to have a final exit and leave qatar . but my bos be not permit me to go . i have no contract with my company . can anybody suggest me a way that i could get final exit .
 talk to him in a polite manner and request that you want to have a final exit . draft a resignation letter and goto him and request in a kind manner and take his signatory on it ; once everything be do then no one can stop you ; if you still face any problem then goto hrd and raise them your concern .
 who be your sponsor ? go talk to him and say you want to go on vacation . then just dont come back and make the same mistake again .
 you can file a complaint to labor department if your sponsor will not let you exit the country and give all that be require by law ( gratuity ; free ticket to country of origin ) it 's not because thing be difficult that we do n't dare ; it 's because we do n't dare that make thing difficult !

 they will ship it via `` aramex '' ... .hummmmm so strange since to my understanding aramex serve via uk and us ( only ) on the other hand ; i will have to agree with the above poster : do you have an import/trading license ? ? ... no ? ? then `` a lot of thing will be seize by the authority '' regards ! !
 just about to write the same a polkadots ... do you trust the seller/dealer ? ? regards ! !
 i think you can do this ; but not order too much . then it will be a if your do business . so then you need a license . my friend be order sometimes personal stuff for him from china .
 yes you can.. i do this without question at all a long they be not the same item a long they be for personal/gift item a long they be not radio equipment such u transmitter or receiver . if a what you mention they be just apparel and it be from china you wont be have a problem with the custom even they be 20 item . and yes china do use the aramex courier as well .
 thank you all ; for the great responses..^^

 both be not good for health
 change be the law of nature .
 no ; arabic be go to return stronger than before ; with qatar univeristy offering law and business major in arabic ; this happend this spring ; before it be all in english ; except arabic and islamic shaira
 where be the arabic qatarliving ?
 arabic is n't die . actually if you have n't notice ; most moroccans and algerian use french a their first language but now after they start re-using arabic again . even here in qatar arabic institute be become more popular since non-arabic speaker be demand it .
 how can arabic die ; when it spoken and learn in 21 country ? ... lol ! http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=h1is0kjljiq & feature=relmfu
 the roman empire be large than the arab world and latin be the official language but where be it now ?
 also ; arabic be one of the language in the un council and probably it go to stay as long a the arab world remain a major crude and petroleum supplier to the world .
 is arabic go the same way a latin ? both be once dominate language but both get supersede . english be now the defacto lingua franca of the gulf ; with arabic be just use in the home
 we have to admit that arabs be not use their language as before a we be be invade by the western culture ( that come in form of tv channel ; movie ; sport ; technology ; etc . ) however ; arabic be the language of the most read and most memorize book by heart on earth ; which be the holy qura'n . now all over the world there be million of people that memorize this book by heart in it 's original language - arabic . so the only way to eliminate the usage of arabic be to get rid of the 1.5 billion muslim around the world ... that thing distinguishes u from the romans and from the latin language ... .so i can say to the romans : `` in yo ' face '' : )
 arabic be not go to die as long a the holy quran remain ; islam be the fast religion in the world . there be story of guy who write about western tourist ; go down into journy into depth of earth . long story to cut short ; when the decide to go back ; they want to leave a message there ; a mark of them be here . so they choose ( he the writer ) to write in arabic . when the author be ask by press ; he say because arabic language be go to stay as long a their there be holy quran ; and it be langauge of the future.and i say ineeded it ; what if all muslims country unite ; we will be more powerfull than america . look to europe ; when they know why usa be stronger than economcly and militray ; they decied to make union to catch with usa ; which be like different countries unite with each other .
 abdira ; did i ever say arabic be go to die ? i be talk about it use in the un council .
 arabic will never die ; it only a temporary period where there be a lot of non-arabs living in gcc and that be the reason for the spread of english ( which be suppose to be the international language ) ; in the future when the construction boom will end in the gcc the arabic language will return to it outstanding position . qatari government have make a very good step to avoid the loss of the language so most of the legal transaction have to be in arabic and many formal department be deal in arabic only . the above be only the social part ; and the religious part be great a for every muslim the arabic language be necessary coz it be the language of the holy qur'an and learn at least a few word be must for them .
 mt : why u try to learn arabic although ur english be the international language and everybody want to learn it ! ? 1- u think that it will be an advantage learn other language regardless whatever it be . 2- u think that arabic be some special language and worth to learn it . 3- the circumstance around u make u learn it . 4- some other reason .
 i learn it because i have arabic friend who i go to visit and their family do n't know much english ; so sometimes they speak and i dont understand . it be tire for my friend to always try and translate to me . also ; i really like the arabic language and would like to know it just so i know what local people and other arabic people be say when they be either communicate to me or about me .
 good 4 u mt ; this be nice of u ; in fact for me work in a construction company with many indians around me make me feel that i should learn hindi and i do not coz i like that language but coz i feel that i have to learn it to make my life easier . so my point be that sometimes u will be in a situation which will force u to learn a language of others and that will benefit them in the end and same be happen for arabic in qatar coz u should know arabic if u want to easily get into formal dept . and that will prevent the death of the language .
 true that many people who memorize qura'n do not totally get what they memorize however lot of the `` quran people '' go into quran study ; learn the arabic language ; and become good arabic speaker than arabs themselves . you ca n't say arabic be the language of allah ; but it be the language of qura'n ... also i just want to clarify a thing ... there be no english version of the qura'n to become more spread and popular than the qura'n we have ; since qura'n be persevere in arabic ; while have side explanation in what ever language . it 's not like the bible where it be translate to ton of language ; the content of quran be preserve in arabic ; the explanation or say interpretation can be write in other language . this be do so we keep the qura'n change-free book ; and not have ten or even hundred of `` holy-books '' that contradict with each-other and each one have a meaning of itself ... we avoid what happen to our fellow christian ; thats why every muslim can be proud when say there be one holy book which be the qura'n : )
 there be a major difference . arabic be the language of many a nation and will not die out..
 qadoomy ; the qu'raan be translate into many language . english be one of them .
 is arabic go the same way a latin ? both be once dominate language but both get supersede . english be now the defacto lingua franca of the gulf ; with arabic be just use in the home
 i have the quran in english !
 i guess that what qadoomi be try to say be `` there be no english version of qur'an '' but there be `` english translation '' which show the meaning of the same ; and which can vary from translator to other but the arabic version be the base for all which ca n't vary or change .
 it 's funny how people cry that they be invade by u ; the eveil westerner when all you hear out there be malayalam ; hindi and tagalog .
 qadoomy ; i get an english version of the holy quran . want a copy ?
 qadoomi ; there be a very simple remedy to this . the rest of the world simply have to not let western people ; movie ; culture ; technology ; science ; knowledge and product enter their country . nobody be force them to accept those thing and people . the rest of the world may very well use their own people ; movie ; culture ; technology ; science ; knowledge and product for their advancement .
 qadoomy ; you just say : `` you speak about indians/pinoys/etc be present here more than westerners ; but i tell you that they dnt have any influence on most ppl ; a they dnt target u with their movie ; song ; etc . if you think i speak about westerner invade qatar ; then you be wrong ; i mean u invade the whole arabic world . please do not take it personal a i dnt hate or target the western citizen a ppl ; but ur government ; medium ; etc . '' they do n't have an influence ? yes they do ; the food ; the clothing ; the manner ; especially when the qataris be a minority in their own country . this be more of the old rotten speech ; they hate the west ; they hate what they be but they want what they have .
 only hotel sell alcohol in a bar-like atmosphere . and it 's expensive . very ! and you can not drive with even a sip of beer on your breath . my husband and i would always say we get ta get out more and then after struggle through the traffic at night for a social event we 'd say ; never again . mandi

 you will not be able to do much a mention by mandi who be well aware of the difference .
 there 's a kind of suburbia effect here ... a lot of people tend to stay home or do chichi thing like play tennis at the club and have hotel brunch . you 'll have to get creative . not impossible ; but it can be a stretch sometimes .
 socialising concern hi ; i be look forward to move to qatar but be wonder if the social side be good to ; do people go out for beer like in the uk after work . i be go to miss london but be take the plunge with the missus but the social side be bother me and i do not want to get bore ? chet

 you could go to the human rights committee but that could take month and be not guranteed . your sponsor have you by the ball i 'm afraid ... .
 is there any specific reason why your sponsor refuse to give you permit ? i think if you have good reason they will allow . speak with them once again before you take this issue to labour department .
 i can see no reason why your employer will refrain from give you an exit permit..however just make sure the follow before file a complaint \ ; 1. make sure that they approve your emergency or vacation leave . 2.just make sure that your mandoob secure it honestly good luck
 give some proof that u will come back ; sponser will win in the court ; not adviceable ; request him once more

 if you find his detail - let me know please . then i 'll report him to the cites office so they can confiscate the poor cheetah and get it into a proper sanctuary for wild animal .
 not this again ... . dejavu http : //www.qatarliving.com/node/845976 wonder if it 's a leopard or a cheetah or the both be out there ... ..
 yes ; again and again ; until the moron be capture .
 epicurean : you must be new here . i guess i think it be more than one guy . anyway ; i saw a guy cruise around with a cheetah rid shotgun at the port of doha .
 pet cheetah does anybody know how to contact the guy who drive around doha in a suv with his pet cheetah in the passenger seat ?
 saw it too ...
 ya i too ! !
 but elton john be gay . he need a substitute .
 oh no..i hav never see ... . cheetah ! ! ! ! ! ! in suv
 in case you find his contact please post it here so that i can get a pic with the cheetah : )
 let 's see what they think of him when the cheetah maul him on the face one day ...
 and it not just one guy . there be many . you need to get a license from the concern department and you can keep one . getting the license be not that easy ! ! ! i know an expat staying in al khor who be try hard to get the license .
 the person hand out licence be thwart decade old trade embargo in cheetah ; an endanger specises ... . who exactly be regulate this ? not this person who be hand out licence ... if he be ... . he 'd know that every person with a cheetah in their vehicle be violate the first law of own a wild animal ... and that be put the life of bystander in danger ... . may he soon be deal with accordingly ...
 xena ... why a child ? the child be innocent . why not let the cheetah maul it owner !
 hehehe i know the guy . you wan na call the cite office to confiscate his cheetah ? ? loool this particular guy can get you ; your family ; your friend ; your friend ' friend deport in 12 hour from doha if he want . plus he have license for his cheetah and be about to own a white tiger soon . really cool guy though . i can give you his phone number if you insist ... it be a very easy number too heheh ; )
 pet cheetah does anybody know how to contact the guy who drive around doha in a suv with his pet cheetah in the passenger seat ?
 quagmire be that why you be suck up to him because he can get you deport if he want ?
 so far the cheetah and all the other wild animal keep here have not maul anyone ; but that be only because they be drug into oblivion ; thing be they get use to it..and then ... bloodbath .
 he 's get a phantom and one of the only very few rs6s ... he be not an idiot chelsea ; not that i agree to own a wild animal . but to each of u the thing we like in life . his cheetah be sick and very friendly tho ... scary when you see it but as friendly a a dog .
 many time we 've be threaten with deportation over the year because we 're `` interfering '' . normally it mean the person be do something illegal/morally wrong and they know they 've be catch .
 ah yes ; i hear he be to get a new pet ... .
 if it 's sick it need to go to a vet . it 's cruel to have a sick animal and not treat it .
 is the cheetah call aiisha ?

 pet cheetah does anybody know how to contact the guy who drive around doha in a suv with his pet cheetah in the passenger seat ?

 quagmire i like cocaine . i can afford have it and will have it in the privacy of my home . should i be allow to have it ?
 so mandi ? what be your point lol
 common sense gkramer ; liking wild animal be not equivalent to like cocaine . but if you really do ; you should go ahead and do it..u live once buddy ... just do it where it be allowed..
 cheetahs can be own privately . if they be respect . but they be not . if someone want to own a big cat ; give it a specially design enclosure which satisfy all of it 's natural behaviour ; feed it a natural diet ; treat it with respect and have strict safety proceedures in place for all aspect of own the cat and be properly regulate with all the correct license and document ( not just buy a license from a friend ) then so be it . we do n't like it but at least it 's well look after . but have it on a collar and lead in a public place ; with little respect for it 's power ; keep it in a barren cage in the garden ; not feed it the right diet ; de-clawing ; drug and de-fanging it - it 's not on . we be here to educate people on all aspect of animal welfare include wild and endangered animal . qaws be a member of the species survival network ( ssn ) which work alongside cites to regulate endangered animal ; which a cheetah be . leaving a cheetah lock in a landcruiser in the underground car park of landmark shop mall with no a/c and no window crack ... . that 's just animal cruelty .
 in qatar both be illegal mate .
 a solely chicken diet wo n't be good for him . assuming he be a 40kg cheetah ; he should be have around 2200 - 2500 kcal 6 day a week with supplemented vitamin and calcium . he should be get a commercial big cat fee daily with chicken/meat add once or twice a week as well a the supplement .
 4 week old and potty train ... ... there be something wrong here !
 sorry i misunderstood proxy just like you misunderstand everything i be say . so if it happen that i know a friend with a cheetah and if it also happen that i be tell people that this guy get some power to own a licensed cheetah ; then i be a suck up . wow.. i just hope you do not apply this logic in your daily life . if you be at this stage of life ; then maybe it be time to go live in a nice place uk boy ? unless if you really like it here ; which would point out your severely bad lifestyle taste . you be not at the stage yet brother ; wake up and stop swimming in your own piss .
 someone please explain ... .can a wild animal like cheetah be potty train before 4 week of age . do n't you find it a bit fishy ? i think the ad be a bit exaggerated !
 pet cheetah does anybody know how to contact the guy who drive around doha in a suv with his pet cheetah in the passenger seat ?
 no wonder the falcon be train to fly back to the original seller ! @ next time around he will sell it for 100 ; 000 usd ... ... ..sucker ! ~
 quite so joa ... .you be right ! cat 's do n't use a toilet ! dogs do if they be train to do so !
 i be still stick on the mental image of see a cheetah on a leash walk through the lobby of the w. sorry ; i 'm afraid my baser instinct would gain ascendancy and i would gawp like a rubber-necker at an accident . the small-town kid in me would go ; `` oh ; my god ; that be so cool ! '' my bad . mandi

 i take down this douche 's license plate age ago and try to report it ; i be tell to bugger off and mind my own business unless i want a one way ticket out of here . this guy be untouchable ; he do have a license for the animal ; and i be tell ( but i 'm not sure if it 's true ) that he actually rescue the animal from a `` friend '' in saudi ; who be keep it in a tiny cage ; and that the animal ca n't stand to be keep in a cage and be `` afraid '' to leave it 's owner side . sounds like horseshit to me ; but hey ; i be tell to shut up .
 how long have you live in qatar now just out of interest ? telling u to `` level down if we want to earn a living '' be a joke . do n't insult me by try to tell me how to live . i 've be a part of animal welfare in qatar for year now and the `` he 'll get you deport '' card just do n't work anymore . qaws report people for a whole number of violation all the time . every license plate number ; mobile number & photo get deliver to the necessary authority ; whether it be someone drive around with a dope up cheetah ; a pet shop sell illegal animal or someone whose stolen a dog . if it do n't get any further than that then at least we 've try to help the animal by bring it to the attention of the authority . i 'm sure he have a license . anyone with the right family name can get one . and i 'm sure he treat it as well a he think it should be treat . but i doubt it 's enough . having a piece of paper do n't mean it 's morally right to own a big cat ; rip it 's claws out ; take it 's teeth out ; drug it to the eyeball and parade it round in public place like some people do . it do n't give you permission to put the life of hundred of people in danger by take your big cat to a crowded car park and get it out to pose with . having a license still do n't mean they be regulate by the authority or have their facility check . there be people here with wild animal with so call `` license '' that do n't take care of them . go to any vet and ask them how many sick and die cheetah cub they see every year because they 're not look after . i 'm sure he be a nice guy . i just think he see his cheetah more of a status symbol then a dangerous wild animal .
 me and my friend be argue what type of animal be that ... but i think and tell her it be a cheetah ! ! ! i find it so cooollll ! ! !
 with whom have you complain about the condition of the animal in the zoo ?
 the animal at the zoo fall under the ministry of environment and any complaint go straight there . we 've work with the zoo directly try to get enrichment program in place for the animal but they do n't ever follow them . the zoo have a tiny budget and the head vet there be a great guy who have huge idea on how to improve everything but none of his superior will authorise the budget to do so . the zoo keeper have no training and be just cleaner who do n't care about the animal at all . we 're try to get a many people a possible to take photo and submit them with a letter of complaint to the ministry of enviroment to try and get them to see how bad it be . the same go for the pet shop and souq waqif as well .
 while i be in the bus go to uni in a nice sunny day in brighton i be read the famous metro newspaper and be shock by this article ; http : //www.metro.co.uk/news/802402-police-knew-john-paul-masseys-home-was-breeding-den-for-dogs to me i would say wild animal with their teeth out be safe than any dog alive ; and god bless all cheetah and some dog specially husky ( i like them i always do ) post some picture of your dog and maybe i will edit my comment and add your dog breed : p
 pet cheetah does anybody know how to contact the guy who drive around doha in a suv with his pet cheetah in the passenger seat ?
 right ... . and you do n't find remove the teeth of a wild animal just so someone can have it a a show-piece pet inhumane ?
 it good than keep them in cage in the zoo or i be wrong ? we let someone to take care of them dont worry about that just try to fee your dog and keep them alive . some people buy dog and dont have money to fee them so.. close conversation .
 i 'm afraid i disagree . keeping wild animal a pet be just as cruel a keep them in a zoo . at least in a zoo they may be keep by professional who actually know how to keep them ; be feed a proper diet and have the chance to live in social group . people who parade them round a pet rarely fee them the right diet ; do n't allow them to behave naturally and then wonder why the animal turn and attack them .
 yep attach your old passport with a valid rp and you can come into qatar ; then you need a letter from your embassy for change name and you can change your name of the rp .
 thanks so much for the advice ... i be just confuse a little about the letter ; shall i get this in my embassy here in qatar once i come back ? or i could get this letter from my home country at the same time while im process my new passport ? god bless to all of you ! thanks again ! : )
 sister ; yes ; could get this letter from your home country at the same time while process your new passport . cheers ;
 and you point be ?
 so far and to my knowledge this be not allow in the immigration scheme actually presenet in qatar . maybe the source from which you hear be try to make some easy money and then leave a `` big trouble '' behind . only wife and kid can get rp . and by the way nothing have be officially notify by immigration neither in the newspaper nor in any of the government related website . regards ! !
 one of my friend go to the immigration department for visa extension of his parent . the guy fill out the form ask him whether this be for permanent residence or temporary . i know there be no official annoucement but you never know in this country .
 i think that be the normal or standard question ask by the agent when they type the form . nothing to do with visa for parent . i have never hear rp for parent in gcc .
 permanent residence for parents dear all ; i hear that permanent residence for parent be possible now for a fee of qar 2 ; 500 . i just want someone here to confirm this before i go to imiigration and embarass myself . my mother be 59 year old and i be look to sponsor her . she be totally dependent on me . she recently go back after stay for six month . i guess anyone work at the immigration department might help .
 my uncle stay in riyadh saudi arabia with his family and my grandmother also stay with him on a permanent residence since she be 70 . now she be 86 and still stay with them . my uncle be the only son and since my grandfather be no more ; where would an old woman stay ? i think if you have a proper justification ; you can sponsor your parents..
 is bicycle play card a requirement for permanent residence of parents ?
 one of my uncle be be sponsor by his son in the uae . its not something impossible in the gcc . for now ; qatar do n't have a rule give permanent residency for parent but may follow the rest of gcc at some stage ; you never know .
 do you have to go through to get you mother on your sponsorship . could you elaborate the process for the benefit of all
 dear mir2890 : i share my knowledge ... you can share your knowledge . unless i have mention here . how you would have counter me . i do n't think you have the right to stop others from talk . good be careful . you be most welcome to share your knowledge and information . so hope you will be patient and respond in a good friendly manner . if my information be wrong ; by your response i can correct it .

 minhajj ; have u try to apply for this visa ?
 hi ; please let me know if for a single dependent parent residence visa be possible in qatar.regards .
 i have not try to apply for the rp personally ; but a friend of mine have be try for the last three year now but all in vain .
 permanent residence for parents dear all ; i hear that permanent residence for parent be possible now for a fee of qar 2 ; 500 . i just want someone here to confirm this before i go to imiigration and embarass myself . my mother be 59 year old and i be look to sponsor her . she be totally dependent on me . she recently go back after stay for six month . i guess anyone work at the immigration department might help .
 why should the government here take the burden of parent sponsorship and medical insurance etc ? will our parent be able to contribute to the economy in any way ? qatar be a grow economy and it can not afford needless burden on it shoulder . i would be happy to be prove wrong ; )
 i have a friend whom he apply for a visit visa for his mother ( 68 yrs old ) . the immigration reject his application for age reason . we 're not sure of the age limit since the officer did'nt answer my friend 's question regard max . age allow .
 not possible ... .
 minhajj ; find a good job back in your place and take care of your parent there itself .
 indeed ; they be `` no one '' . great ; bluebull .
 right lp ... ... ... guest be not allow to bring all his dependent to host house . it be allow in uae for high salaried individual ; by pay medical / health insurance of aed 5000/- annually for each parent . you be right bb ... ..it carry economic sense but human value be miss . i know a family in qatar have 4 brother stay in qatar for last over 2 decade ; each brother sponsor their age mother separately to keep her in qatar round a year .
 hello victory ; your information look quite relevant . if it 's true be it possible to share some reference though whom i can learn the procedure of parent rp . thanks ; regards .
 it be not rp it be a visit visa ; expire once every 3 month .
 thanks how many time this visit visa can be extend ?

 contact your relatives in india and let them send another relative to works as your housemaid..or call the uk or canada or germany .
 i 'm afraid it be illegal to have a full-time housemaid living with you that you do not sponsor .

 gypsy - i think you have all the credential to become qatar 's crazy cat lady < img src= '' http : //2.bp.blogspot.com/ '' >
 you just replace the lack of men in your life with cat ... ... i 've see it happen and once you take that route there be no way back ...
 that 's what my boyfriend say too exiledsaint . : p actaully the woman i know with lot of cat all have husband or long term boyfriend . i think the spinster with cat thing be a myth/stereotype .
 i remember this rough american constuction guy once and he apply to one of those russian dating site back in the 90 when lot of lady be look to get out of russia . however he could not understand why all the picture the agency send him where of woman surround by cat . we check his application form and under interest he write pussy . now obviously the russian translate this and decide that he must have be a cat lover ... ..
 no ; it 's not pathetic ! you be a loving and give woman who want to open her heart to yet another poor orphan . it 's wonderful . mandi
 gypsy ; if you think you manage two cat well ... and add more would n't be a burden to your sched ; then by all mean go ahead.. they say that a person who like cat be often refer to a a sensitive person.. : ) [ img ] < strong > nothing in life be to be fear . it be only to be understood. < /strong >
 3 cats ... ... .not a big deal at all . i know one western lady in qatar who have morethan 30 cats and one dog ... `` hatred be the coward 's revenge for be intimidate '' ... .g.b . shaw
 30 ! ? ! that 's not the owner of the vetrinary clinic be it ?
 no gypsy..last week i visted her house..it be really amazing to see all that cat .

 hmmm ; my boyfriend be try to say that one more would be too many ... i 'm really tear . the kitty be half blind and desperately need a home . : (
 hmmm ; my worry be i get 3 ; what 's stop me from 4 ? or 5 ? i need to stop go to qaws : p
 i think 3 be probably a recognised limit before you start get strange look from people . also ; if you get any more than 3 then the cat food expense will really start to affect your budget . ok i 've give you reason why not to get any more than 3 ; and now it 's up to you to maintain that stance !
 you need each other i love cat and would have a house full of them ; but i 'm allergic : - ( and i aint no crazy old spinster ; just an animal lover i have 2 ; but they have to live outside so adopt that one on my behalf : - )
 go on gypsy ! have mercy on the cat . : d < i > mind your own business ; then you will see the joy come into your life .
 check to all of those ; although i 'd love to have more time with them . : )
 ok so there 's no physical reason why you can not have the 3rd cat . from what i can tell ; you 're indecisiveness do not come from the fact that you think 3 cat be too many ; it come from the fact that you think 3 cat may lead you to more cat ; and thus the crazy cat lady syndrome . rest assure ; that when you have 3 cat ; you will really only have 3 cat . extra cat will not magically appear no matter how much you worry you will fall into the temptation to have more cat . if you be worried now that 4 or 5 cat be beyond your limit ; then i can safely say that the worry will not disperse in your sleep over night ; and you will not be force to watch your foot a they uncontrollably lead you into the cat shelter and pick out another kitty to add to your already full household . i can promise you ; your thought process will still be intact after 3 cat ; and even if you want more ; you will be able to weigh the consequence and decide against another one ; no matter how cute the face star at you be .
 lol . one can only hope missx . : )
 i have faith in you gypsy !
 got a little bit excite about the cat and get click happy ?

 motorcycles for rent at losail circuit ? can someone tell me if/where can i find a honda cbr600rr or yamaha r6 for rent in doha for track day ? and some price ... thank you !
 www.q-biker.com you can rent a ducati or a buell ... . i do not recomend you go to the track with them ...
 at silverstone cicuit in united kingdom you can rent a sport bike for about 300gbp per day ... at pannonia ring in hungary there be bike for about 500-700 euro per weekend ... .and so on ... so that be posible and this be not funny ... . thanks for information ... .
 listen man ; in the us you can now schedule a visit to the moon if you pay enough money . can you do it in doha ? yes it be very funny what you ask . try tell the rental company you will take their bike to the track and even the receptionist will laugh at your silly ar . u need special insurance & proof of race experience ; and in a place like doha ; good luck have a company go an extra step for these process ! plus of course enough demand for the rental business to survive after rent for a 0.1 % population of bike racer with no bike . good luck though ; tell them in uk they do it if they object .
 this forum be for ask ... .i don t know what can i find there ...
 ok ; just keep in mind that track do not open until october in here . i actually work in the field of racing ; which be why i be try to educate you ; but sure if you think i be waste your time . also ; the best you could find here anyways be a stock with a bazzaz ecu and a b.s tune a there be n't even a proper dyno in here . easy on the ego/attitude buddy ; i do n't need to see your result because i ca n't care less : )

 morning 0700hrs to 1300hrs
 i do n't think that be correct . i read on a forum that it be definitely open until 7pm . i just want to know if they close in the afternoon ...
 it be 7am to 7pm
 ask the traffic police department . they know where they put them .
 if you have a smartphone ; then install `` trapster '' . it be fairly useful ( few false alarm ) .
 traffic cameras hi guys ; anybody be have a idea where traffic cameras have fix in doha ? but it be not everywhere ; ; ; ; could you please mention place where u have see these camera ? just contribute at least by mention one place ! ! ! ! thx .
 as long a you 're obey traffic rule you do n't have to know where the camera be instal . : - )
 obey traffic rule and forget the camera be safe drive ! ! ! !
 company will transfer all your end of service and final settlement of salary to your bank a/c . and will give a notice to bank you be terminate from job . so the bank will freeze your account and transfer the proceeds to loan settlement .
 if u r not have money to pay pls tell them to take the car and close the account ; or give the for sale at qatar living and if sell fopr a good price pls close the loan and give the car to the new person . if u be in doubt pls start do now itself
 but what will happen to the balance loan amount ; which will be there after all money recover by way of final settlement ; freezing of a/c will the bank allow him to leave the country with unpaid loan ? ? ?
 the sponsor will not cancel the rp until receive a bank letter state that there be no outstanding liability . so if you owe money on a loan you ca n't leave until it be settle . best to borrow money from friends/family to pay it off ; or you might get arrest for be a loan defaulter . there be nothing you can do to avoid pay back the money .
 in our company there be same situation with one person..he was terminated from his job ... then he ask for noc because he have no money to pay for loan . and he got noc now he be do job in another company and also he pay his loan also every month .
 what about the fee which i pay for insurance while take the loan . will not they help something by pay the remain amount to the bank .
 thanks 2 all
 for the last 28 year ; i just do n't understand what kind of celeberation way be this by create so much trouble for other commuter & police . they will shout like animal ; make loud engine noise ; burn their tyre . they do n't realize that may be there might be a patient behind them who need medical attention or have somekind of pain in his ear by hear loud voice etc . . sadly speak [ no offense ] ; they be qatari youth mostly . i wonder whether they give any alms or donation in the name of allah if they get any happiness or victory in their failed but at the same time very popular game football . . they just proof themselves a one of the most ignorant people on earth a they just do n't care for others .  *****///you remind me of my next girlfriend///*****
 ruckus in corniche this friday when we go to corniche there be trail of car wave some checker flag and drive at crazy speed and create lot of problem to people by stop the car in between the road and hop in to other car . does anyone no what all this ruckus be all about . the traffic police really have a tough time control all this .
 actually there celebration remind me of biker gang in us . and when you see them you do the exact same two thing no matter where you be . 1 ) ignore them ; 2 ) back in your mind you say ... ..idiots
 i like it when qatar win the football ; it make me feel part of a proud country . that say ; i do n't live in doha and it 's a bit different to have a few people roar round dukhan waving flag and hoot . if i be on the corniche at that time it would have probably be different . i have have to wait before on the fast road to shahhania a 2 car have block the road to have a chat !
 it be their way of celebrate the weekend or some even like football etc . and i absolutley do n't find anything wrong with it . usually there be a huge trail of vehicle honk and blink musically and the timing they choose be always after 11.30 pm . so ; it be certainly not a office timing . and if they encounter an ambulance they give it a way ; i have observe it personally . even once our own car be clinch among them somewhere near mall r/a and they stay behind u and give u a way . there be different way people celebrate their weekend ; some drink ; dine and date . what be wrong if some people choose drive a their way to enjoy ? everything gon na be alright ! ! !
 yah they be qatari so what be your problem they be celibrating they dont disturb other country so pls . live them alone they be in their own country .
 i be at corniche too . my friend wave and shout 'mabrook ' and they wave back . nothing in comparison to a wedding procession in india though ; band and groom on the horse and ... ..
 wed procession in india be something with reason and have a specific route ( short distance generally ) ; but what be the reason for these ? ? ? just read someone support this type of 'vulgar display of wealth ' ... wow ! what supporters !
 comm'on they be passionate about football . they be young with rag hormone and want to express their feeling for something they feel for . hah ! ! ! i would be with drum cheer for my college cricket team with a hoarse throat in my youthful day . ( not that i be old ... )
 guys be lookin 4 a contact in qatar foundation 2help get ajob who know anyone plz
 mom ... no you be n't old at all ; still you have the spirit ... .lol ! my opinion be to critic something which obstruct civic life . venting out enthusiasm by slow down traffic be not at all civilsed ; what do you say ?
 but siddh ; they normally do it only once a week and that too on late friday night be what i have observe . is there any harm in it ? the traffic move more slowly for say 10-15 min but come on ; it be not office time . rather than a 'vulgar display of wealth ' i feel it be their way of relax on a weekend . as long a they do n't harm anybody i feel it o.k . they be just have a nice time . well ; i wish to join the convoy sometime just for fun ... : ) everything gon na be alright ! ! !

 shreeya - think this way : - relaxing on public property ? is it normal ? - disrupting traffic by stop car on the road ; speed etc . for relax . is it sane ? - you compare drink ; dine & date with road rage ... .the difference be clear between privately celebrate or show off publicly ? watch this video ... .another kind of 'relaxing ' http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=pjupndikkek maybe future of qatar ? lol !
 rumor . you need a noc to change sponsor and this be purely upto the sponsor ; whether he want to issue one or not .
 in your list ; armada would be the favorite although prado be not too bad either . but if you want the best suv of all among the japanese model ; then my view be that it be the nissan patrol . on the other hand if you want to buy a good suv but still want to be green and go easy on the environment : then buy either a prado with 2.7 litre engine or a toyota fortuner with the same 2.7 litre engine . the 2.7 engine in the fortuner be cool on fuel and the car be a reasonably sturdy 4x4 and 7 seater .
 armada ? is n't that in a different class to the other 2 ? armada have a 5.6 v8 engine and be more suitable for a family car that only go to the sand ( beach ; dune ; etc . ) rarely or lightly . the prado and pajero both offer v6 engine with good ( if not very good ) off-road capability . the i4 prado be not consider good due to lack of power . both these v6 car be quite reliable too ( i do n't know enough about the armada ; though ) and can carry up to 7 people with the driver . maintenance wise ; toyota and nissan can be difficult due to the long queue at their service station . otherwise ; you can try your luck with non-dealership service workshop . i 'm sure there be a lot of good one out there that can work on these three model . you can head to driverarabia dot com for more info on most car .
 re choice of suv prado > pajero > armada ! toyota prado 2012- the txl score over vx 'cos you can always get aftermarket gps whachamacallit to spruce up your prado txl . upper spec trim may be a waste of $ $ $ . mitsubishi pajero 2012- the 3.8 271 hp rank higher over other pajero variant and when compare against prado & armada ; the pajero may appear 'dated ' nissan armada 2012- v8 beast ; gas guzzler !

 well baldrick be not here so i have to answer google be the answer
 i answer lot of questions .
 dont play football
 should muslims wear these football jersey ? should muslims wear football jersey which display image of cross ; liquor brand and devil ? if they do ; would it be a if muslims be worship and exalt the symbol of other religion ? among the football team whose crest carry image of the cross be brazil ; portugal ; serbia ; barcelona and norway ; while manchester united carry the red devil slogan on it team crest . what do you think ?
 muslims have good jersey to wear instead of this crap one ... i know the future of this thread ... be it go to go ! : (
 by this standard muslims in switzerland and other country with cross on their flag should n't salute the flag or wear it on their uniform . and what if a muslim play for england or scotland -- two more flag with cross ?
 i think you be an idiot . well ; you do ask ! as to man utd . to the best of my knowledge they have no muslim player ; so it 's not really an issue be it ? they be traditionally a catholic team many year back . it be difficult for a protestant to break into the team let alone a non-christian !
 let the muslim player play the sport decide that for himself ; he 's get a mind of his own and you nor me be in a position to dictate what he should or should not wear . so stfu and go to your corner . like the wiseman rizks say ; this thread will take an ugly turn !
 baldrick you beat me to the idiot comment but ya he be ask for it .
 another thread to spread hate taliking ; no need to comment
 i have a request to the mod to delete such thread and i will flag it a offensive . i do have another request to all qlers not to post offensive subject in this forum . i know that a real muslim will not post anything offensive to another community and i be expect the same from all the other community in ql and if thing be go in this way then i will say good bye to ql even if be of not something important for you all . please abide the guideline of the forum . if anyone be interested for a debate on something relate to a community they should approach the community leader for a debate .
 it be the game that matter ... not the jersey or the player.. so well be away with your f***ing thoughts.. try to be a human than a worshiper ...
 you forget liverpool ... ..carlsberg
 if yes then please go post your question on some religious forum ( i can recommend you some if you like ... by pm ) or good still go ask a scholar . posting such query on a public forum of mixed belief be a sure fire way to cause religious bashings & mockery both to you & islam.oh & if you be not a muslim ... well non of your beeswax then..lol
 should muslims wear these football jersey ? should muslims wear football jersey which display image of cross ; liquor brand and devil ? if they do ; would it be a if muslims be worship and exalt the symbol of other religion ? among the football team whose crest carry image of the cross be brazil ; portugal ; serbia ; barcelona and norway ; while manchester united carry the red devil slogan on it team crest . what do you think ?
 his highness sheikh abdulla after he buy a club say he will not renew sponsorship with a gambler company ; and remove it from the team . but for the player they have no choice ; this be the team they play for and they only wear it during game .
 i ask the question a i pick it up in an article from malaysia . here 's the link : http : //thestar.com.my/news/story.asp ? file=/2010/7/19/nation/6689974 & sec=nation wanted to know what muslims in gulf thought of it . btw ; gkramer ; baldrick2dogs ; you label me an idiot ; and yet you argue with me . so what do that make you ? do n't hate the messenger ; hate the message .
 i do n't argue with you ; i just label you an idiot ; ) i be not argue even now ; i be still call you an idiot : d
 now wait ; do i need to order my bebsi and bobcorn ? ?
 i dont understand why anything and everything be be relate to religion . what do a sport have to do with the religion of a player . i dont think the football will not come to the player coz he be a muslim ... as far a clothing and sign be concern ; they have their own meaning . they just dont put a cross on the tee for namesake . u get to dig deep to know the meaning of that symbol on their tee .
 i wo n't take offence ; since an *ss be call me an idiot . i guess that 's what you do ; when you ca n't contribute anything intellectual . ; )
 without bother the find the detail . did i issue the instruction ? no ; i just ask the question to find out the opinion of muslims in the gulf . did i insult the religion ? not at all . but yet you choose to come to the defence of the religion ( i hope ) by label me an idiot . how be i an idiot ? by seek to clarify confusion and misunderstand ? from the view express above ; it be obivious that not all muslims share the opinion . so obiviously this be a misinterpretation of the religion . and that help separate religion from the politics and propaganda that cloud it . perhaps you should jump into the gulf . seeing a you 're already jump to conclusion .
 i be very happy with the world around me ; i ai n't jump into any gulf ; )
 firstly ; i think you 're the one to blame for everyone call you an idiot . reason be be that you do n't put the source of the article ; thereby make everyone think that you 're ask the question and be out for some religious bashing .
 no problemo amigo ; remember to quote the source ... always ! ! ! ; - )

 should christains stay inside when there be a crescent moon ? its a question we should all ask ourselves ... and they should not play for portsmouth either a it on their football jersey !
 thread ; beter ignore
 that be very much possible . your private doc may refer you there . just make sure to register in hamad for give birth ; i think that be to be do by 35 week but not sure .
 yes you can.i have my prenatal at the private doctor and give birth at womens hospital .the private dr. will give you referral letter for the hospital you want to deliver your baby .
 against the law to work while on a visit visa . if your brother want to find a job here then he would have to transfer his visa to a work visa or risk get into trouble .
 it problem
 well it illegal for anyone to work under a visit visa ; but there be many people who still dont mind / care . some employer do employ people on short term basis though it be illegal . if catch both can be fin and ur husband would most probably deport .
 thanx ; it 'll be a great help
 you will go to police and go out of country
 if you be work in a hidden place nothing will happen espacially if you stay away of problem . but if you be catch due a problem you do espacailly in resturents or front office ; the interior ppl will throw you out of the country with a band
 what be the risk of work without a visa in qatar ? can someone tell me what be the risk of start work ( qatari company ) before my visa which entitle me to work be sort out ? it would only be a week or two ; but i be just wonder how seriously this be take in qatar .
 1.if you need medical assistance it will turn out that you be an outlaw here . postponing to solve the health issue can turn fatal . 2 . once you leave the country you can not come back ..so you be force to stay here as long a possible if you think the job be worth ..
 lol good one

 either go to western union or use online banking . brazil be no different to any other country in this respect .
 if that fail ; give it to me ; i will make sure it get there ... ... ... ... ...
 which bank in brasil you want to send the money ?
 call remittance department at hsbc head office ; qatar . you can find the contact number on their website . i belive they can do the transaction through banco do brazil or through their own office in brasil .
 should i accept this offer i be a project design engineer in hvac from pakistan have an experience of 4 year . i be be offer a gross salary of 8000 qr by a mep contracting company . i be still negotiate my term @ 10k qr . need advise from the experienced lot ? ? what about family visa in qatar ? how can bring my wife to qatar ? would really appreciate some great advise .
 i would think 9-10k be reasonable a a basic salary for 4 year of experience . however ; i do think you need to be pay additional allowance for accommodation ; transport etc . also make sure your annual flight and medical insurance be cover . all the best .
 family visa be not a problem . once you come in and complete your residency formality ; you can process your wife 's visa .
 firstly i take it this be 8000 per month ? if so then no do n't accept unless the contractor provide you with housing at the very least . rent in doha be very expensive . the average rent for a 2 bedroom apartment in doha with furniture be at least 6000 qr a month . as for family visa 's i do n't know enough to give you accurate information . but if you have children who be at school then you would also want the contractor to pay tutition fee a school fee be expensive a well .
 if you get the accomodation allowance or comnpany provided accomodation and the medical coverage ; then even 8000 qatari riyal be also ok but 10000 qatari riyal will be fair enough for a person with 04 year experience only.it also depend on your family size like for a small family with a kid or no kid even you can survive in one bedroom + 01 sitting room also which may be aorund 4000 qatari riyals fully furnish but for a big family it will be very difficult for you to stay on your own a you will need to get a big house . arranging the family visa be not a big problem as long a you have salary more than 7000 qatari riyals.best of luck

 bro ; my piece of advice ; advance rental payment of 1 year be not practical and very risky . i highly suggest that you look somewhere else . there be a lot of flat and villa right now be offer by the owner itself and not those filthy ; good for nothing ; boot-licking ; single cell ; blood-sucking and parasitic real estate agent . ahhh ; that be much well . cheers ;
 what you go to do if you be be redundant a month after you pay him ?
 normally they ask post dated cheque but 1 year rent in advance ; too risky so no way ... .
 i encounter these same individual . when we request copy of the contract between themselves and the owner ; they mysteriously disappear . everyone i question say this be a scam ; which be become more common . a new 3 bedroom apartment for qr 4500 ... it be obviously too good to be true .
 real estate agent fake ? hi ; i have be offer a 3 bhk flat for qr 4500 but the rental should be pay in one year advance which be about qr 54000 . i be not sure about this agent whether this be a fake or real ? please tell me if this be ok to go ahead with such an offer ? or is there any place where i can verify about this agent thanks in advance
 please dont risk that . my husband & i enter a similar deal ; the landlord walk in on u say he have cancel his contarct with the agent and be ask u to retrieve our money and deal directly with him . we have trust that the agent be work on teh landlors asignement & have even comfirmed this with contract sign by the two . we be still struggle to get our money back from the agent & in the mean time the lanlord want his pay so badly . dont even think abt it . pay monthly or simply give post date cheque ... fore warn !
 please first contact the indian embassy for all the detail . there be no issue to get marry here but get all the detail to do it legally from the embassy ...

 if you obtain your visa illegally then you have no right . if you want to retain your right ; do not buy a work visa .

 i do n't buy my visa with them ; i work a executive manager but suddenly come a problem and they terminate me a sale executive and ask me to pay the say amount for car ; transfer of sponsorship and iqama .
 what be my right ? i be ask to pay 14 ; 500 so i can get my release paper ; but when i already pay the say amount ; still i 'm not get any document from them . what i have to do . anyone can give me advice or help me regard this issue ?
 i refuse to pay but they have already threaten me that they will bring all my document to cid once i will not pay on that day . i also get statement of account on all thing i pay to them but there be no signatory on it but there be a logo stamp on the paper . one thing more be he be a powerful person here in qatar so i get scar when he tell me to bring one way ticket to hell .
 if i be go to seek help from the ministry of labor ; be i sure that i will be safe ? i 've see a lot of people who complain but they be in big trouble ; they be even send to jail for just claim for their right .
 yes.. ex-pats just like you and me get treat like this.. horrible i say but i speak the truth .

( attest by your embassty and then by qatar ministry of forign affair ) you first need to apply for approval at labour dept once approve then submit at immigration dept for visa . these be few that i can remember also do check with labour dept requirment and immigration dept for any more requirments .

 get a tourist visa from hotel instead . it would cost you more but at least it be a legal way of do thing .
 it usually take 3-5 working day . they do not process visa but only certify that the paper you receive from your sponsor here in qatar be legitimate . basically the embassy will only translate the entry visa that you will have to show to the visa personnel in naia prior to check in . once you arrive at the airport here in qatar ; you have to show it to the immigration personnel on duty .
 qatar embassy phils . kabayans ; how long will it take the processing of visa ( with passport ) thru dhl ; in phils . qatar embassy ? say ; if you 're just right there in manila area . thanks .

 10000 qr without company accommodation or 7000 qr with company family accommodation .
 check the due amount to pay and if it be above 250 call 111 and ask .
 dear friend ... . happen same to me almost 7 month ... during register and installion they ( qtel ) say that 250 permonth ... but i have to pay 285 permonth when receive the bill ... keep ask qtel ... same answer ... always say next month u pay 250 ... already 6 month ... feed up no ask anymore..just pay 285 permonth .
 the promotion probably start a day after your installation ; or end a day before . even if you prove it ; and convince them ; qtel do n't do refund ; they 'll keep it in your account for that service .
 sorry guy for post again . i be use mozaic tv+ which be take during the promotional period . i be pay only qr . 250/- per month . i dont think there be hidden charge for qtel services . it will be good you call qtel and inform them about it . they will ask you to pay the bill completely and will give you a credit for the difference which will be adjust in your next bill .
 i call q-tel they tell to me if you do n't have land line then will pay landline installation charge.but in the qtel site clearly specify all installation be free . i cut from site that word below . today qtel unveil mozaic tv+ service a part of it summer promotion series with substantial discount for family to entertain themselves while at home . this promotion carry up to qr1290 in saving which include free installation and free additional channel for two consecutive month . what you think about this ?
 i think it mistake from qtel . talk with qtel representive . i also get mozaic and istalation for me be free . so they will definetlly adjust in next bill
 and also in advertisement they specify for more information call 111. then i call this number and ask about the landline installation they tell to me all installation charge be free include landline also . yesturday my friend call this number ; again they tell like that . then why they charge landline installation charge ? . if they charge installation charge then should get all fecilities like : international and mobile call also . but i get only landline to landline only . at the application time they didi n't ask for which fecilities you need ? . thatmeans this telephone include this package.125 digital tv channel basic channel + additional channel ( 2 month free ) + 512 mb speed network connection + home telephone ( landline to landline ) .

 article 54 ; labor law .
 thank you so much magicdragon . does that mean they have to give the eosb ( min . 3 week ) even if it 's not mention in our actual contract ? is it law that a small non-govenment company have to give a letter of no objection if they end your contract 5 month before the contract finish due to their not have work ? also : a ) if i/we cancel our rp and leave the country without a no objection letter ; be there any restriction on me ( or our family ) be allow back into the country on a visitor 's visa ; obtain from the airport ? b ) if work cancel my rp whilst we be out of the country ; and we do n't have a no objection letter ; can we enter the country again on a visitor visa obtain at the airport ? is there any site to go to and check your status of rp ? how would you be notify if your rp have be cancel ?
 yes ; in order for your company to have opt out of the end-of-service gratuity it would have to be in your contract . otherwise ; it 's there . secondly ; i do n't know of any rule that say company must give an noc in such-and-such circumstance . it seem to be totally up to their discretion . finally ; if you have be on a family visa you do n't need an noc to re-enter after your rp be canceled/expired . only the worker need an noc and he/she always need an noc within the two year time frame . mandi

 what be the best and easy way to send lcd tv 32inch to india ? hi.. i would like to know what be the best and cheap ( of course ; safe too ) to send one 32inch lcd tv to india ? be it possible to send lcd tv 's along with people who be go to india a luggage ? ? or be it too big for that ? please if you know anyone who be forward this kind of thing .. please let me know .. thanks
 32 '' sony bravia ; weigh around 22kg only with original packing . i 'm not sure the original packing will be safe enough to put a a luggage . you may use another packing over the original packing and fill with clothes to absorb any shockes during rough handling . the weight and size be ok a luggage in passenger a flight . but not suitable for hand baggage a it 's size be more than permittable for hand baggage .
 the brand which i have be that samsung . i get it for special price ( 1399 ) along with wall bracket . so i felt it would be cheap to send a it on a special price : ) ..
 why r u take it to india dude ; u get the same piece for a bit more and be assure of a 3 year warranty ... ..and also a lot more accessory . i be in india in jan and be surprise that toy and electronics be price almost the same ... hope this help
 there be so many door to door service personnel in doha ; check with them ; i 'm sure they will send the same safely . if u find any ; do n't forget to post the detail here so that others can also think of your innovative idea ...

 i think it will be much good to buy it in india a the price difference be reasonable and you will get service as well a warranty . if you be take it from here to india either you have to take it with you or you have to send it by air or sea cargo . it be bulky and heavy to handle it at the airport . i think a 32 '' lcd tv will weigh more than 20kg . if you be send it by cargo they will pack it for you and i think it will cost you approximately qr . 800/- ( pls check with any cargo ) include freight ( air ) and custom duty and if you spend one third of that with the price you be pay here for the tv you will get it deliver in your house with service and warranty in india .
 the best be by dhl good luck

 digg under your chair ; you 'll find oil and gas at a good term and condition .
 rightly point out ; that be an underutilized and overlook source that can easily be convert to usable energy in qatar . perhaps the reason behind this be an abundance of other natural resource available for use ; leave an alternative source not much important in present scenario . nevertheless ; i think if such source could be 'sold ' to the authority ; there be all the chance for the decision maker to sit up and take notice .

 have you be drink too much wine ... . do such wine exist and if so what be the point ? that be like have a car without any wheel and an invitation to the playboy mansion with only 10 mintues to get there ...
 wine be a wine ... .
 it call sparkling grapejuice my friend ... lol
 yes such a thing exist ; just like for beer - they make it a usual then use one of several process to remove the alcohol without remove the distinctive taste . lol i would liken it to a car with no emission rather than no wheels ! ! ! some people ; for medical ; religious ; drive or other reason ( my mum for example get drunk after a thimble-full of wine ) like to enjoy the taste of wine without the alcoholic effect . here be a website selling it ; but i want it here in qatar ! ! ! i would have think that with all the rich arab around ; there would be a demand for it ... ...
 lol most of the non alcoholic beer do indeed taste appal ; more like horlicks ; however a a previously commit beer drinker and member of the campaign for real ale ; i can say that some alcohol free beer be acceptable . the key to it be de-alcoholising a fully ferment malt ; rather than halt the fermentation early ; which leave it sweet-tasting . in doha the only one that be ok be holsten ; but others exist outside doha . still wait for someone to point me in the right direction !
 no way out . you be stuck

 driving ford vehicle no problem everything be good power steer exceelent ; robust etc ... ... ... ... ... . except the maintainence cost .
 very bad service and spareparts.. i guess . others be ok and i like it 4x4 what about the price ?
 hi ; i have an old 2003 model . it drive very well . no problem . i buy it because it 's more compact than the large toyotas . drives more like a car . steering & handle good . power be good . 4.0ltr v6 be well tried & test . this be the big selling suv in america for many year . no problem at all with service & none for spare part if you visit the ford service centre . i be just out there on saturday to get a new cap for the brake master cylinder reservoir which some-how go miss . they look it up on the computer - cost be qr10 . plus a new rubber bumper for the rear door latch be also miss - again no problem at all . cost qr5 .

 why men stare bcoz ... .if men dont stare the woman then it will be waste of time for woman who spend hour to dress up nd do make up for men ... ..so men dont want to waste the precious time of woman .
 you should go out more if you think woman do n't stare

 dear friends thank you very much you all for your input
 what bank be the best i want to open a new bank account ; anyone can comment about the commercial bank ? r they good or not ; from your experience people which bank be most helpful and with good facilitation ?
 you should be ask which bank be the least evil of all
 try commercial bank and they be good ! ! all the best ! !
 commercial bank - big thief ahli bank - small thives so go for ahli bank
 qatar national bank be best in qatar ; open a/c in qnb ; you will enjoy !
 non of them be a good bank . but i can suggest to open an account in the bank which have more branch open during the day . -qatar national bank . -comercial bank of qatar . -doha bank . if you want islamic bank i recomend qatar national bank islami wish you the best
 the procedure be simple but it take some time . you will go to ahli and tell them that you want to repay your loan in full . they will make the paperwork and contact you . normally there be no tax besides the leftover amount you have to pay back . but this be qatar ... nothing be normal when it come to banking . so they might charge you ... why do n't you just give them a call and ask .
 i think ( when i take a loan from hsbc ) you will have to pay a high interest during the first year if you want to clear your loan . after the first year you pay only 1 % on the balance amount and get a clearance letter . but it be always good to check with the customer service at the bank a sometimes rule change and each bank may have their own policy . however ; qatar central bank set the rule ; so be sure the bank be not rip you off .
 yes they do apply a penalty . and i think it 's 1 or 2 % of the remain amount without interest . so basically if you have to pay 100 qr ( no interest include ) you will end up pay 101 qr . they apply this penalty because they be not entitle to charge you the interest anymore . banks ... ca n't live with them ; ca n't live without them ...
 they apply the penalty because by repay your loan early they be not make any more money off the loan ( in the form of interest ) .
 be it same for car loan also ?
 loan repayment have a loan from ahli bank for 150000qrs for 4 year . planning to clear it in one settlement . what be the procedure and will they charge me anything for this action ? now the interest rate be 6 % flat .
 1 % charge .. i do the same but ahli s***ing u
 it 's the same for all loan

 understanding qatari phone number hi there ; i receive a phone call from qatar and do n't get the chance to answer . is there any reverse look-up for phone number in qatar ? how do the number brake up 974 + ? + ?
 if you do n't get the number ; not possible to do anything about it .
 maybe he be ask if there be any area code number or something like this . +974-33-xxxxxx +974-55-xxxxxx +974-66-xxxxxx +974-77-xxxxxx these be mobile +974-44-xxxxxx it be land line
 you need to repeat the first digit to call your friend for example : > a education centre in qatar give you number 2 year ago : 4212590 . you could dial +974-4212590 . > but now you have to dial +974-4-4212590 . ( be careful to understand what i say ; it be repeat the digit and not add any 4 ) . this answer be give because she didnt tell when she receive the call .

 good question coz one of my frnd 's be look for the same thing as well .
 simsigat ; where in doha ; exactly ?
 i be not sure if you will find proactive in qatar . skincare be something which the consumer have a sort of loyalty . a consumer who be use clinque ; clarins or lancome product be not go to change to a new brand even if it be have very good product or marketing strategy . it will be difficult for a brand like proactive to survive in a niche skincare market like qatar . it will be good if you can buy it on line or arrange with someone to buy it from us .
 why hunt for proactive ? if you be have any facial issue ; just try some very simple but great result home remedies.its easy and doest cost a lot . good luck
 i 'm pretty sure you will have to order it or ask someone to bring it from the us .
 i think u can get proactiv product in boots pharmacy in viallagio or land mark i m not sure but u can try
 i do n't know how but i be enjoy it in english ; just to rub it in a bit : p
 barcelona and real madrid game anybody know how to get the commentry in english ... .we get it in french here : -/
 that game be an absolute disgrace - player intent on get each other send off ; more activity on the bench than on the field ; moroninho act like the petulant child that he be - spanish football at it cheating ; lie ; snide bad - `` great game '' - common brit ; id rather watch accrington stans v port vale ! ! if thats the best thats on offer ; good neither of them turn up at wembley for the final and united just take the trophy by default . the contrast between tueasday night game and wednesday night game be stark . its little wonder to me that the football naive fan of the middle east be take in by spanish football .
 al jazzera +9 have english commentary the usually it i son +3 which last night be in french wtf . anyway a new octopus have yesterday predict that real madrid in the final . well go by last night score it will be a mountain to climb at nou camp for real to overcome a 2-0 deficit .
 @ milybar ; you get lucky mate ; i must 've inadvertantly tick `` french '' & `` arabic '' in my qtel application ; 'cos that 's all i get ; +9 be french for me ... as for the game itself ; absolutely digraceful performance by madrid ; '' jose mourinho- best coach in the world '' my a # @ ... it be pathetic to see how he set up his side to disrupt the flow of the game because he knew if he go out there & play the game in the true spirit of football ; it could well have be another 5-0 thrashing like barca give his `` galacticos '' @ the camp nou a couple of week back ... so much for `` the most expensive club in the world '' ! ! ! ... just go to show limitless fund alone do not a great team make ; same story with chelsea & man . city ; plenty of money ; no vision ... football win last night amidst madrid 's anti-football ; barca still shine through ... i 'm a liverpool supporter through & through but the way barca play & win last night ; i ca n't help but hand it to them ; messi 's 2nd goal be a moment of footballing brilliance ... unless there 's some massive miracle ; barca be take the european cup this time ; no question about it ...
 gadarene ; opps sorry forget to mention that i be watch through the al jazeera satelite channel and not qtel mozaic . maybe a request can be make by the concern to qtel to change the commentry to english for the next week game !
 deposit amount ... yes but ; about the take back the checkes b4 the end of the leasing contract ... depend on the contract between the two parties..but usually this issue can be solve by post an early termination letter to the lanlord befor 2-3 month from the date of leave . watching yoo
 as i know legally you shall pay for entire contract period and the land lord will not be in need to return your cheque . but here the land lord will be very happy when they understand you be leave since they can give to some one for high rent . in addition they will get rent amount for one or two month from the date of vacate . ( free rent ) . if you be lucky u will get back your cheque without any deduction . but remember u r in qatar .
 renting law in qatar state that if your rp be cancel the landlord must refund all pay rent and return the cheque . the normal notice period be 1 month but you be not responsible if you be fire without notice and your rp cancel . these people be crook ; dont let them take you for a greedy ride .
 them roof ; them rule ! you compmain about it ; get deport !
 because some nationality be more likely to bring over elderly relative to take advantage of the healthcare that be provide here . and those same nationality be less likely to come and visit here and spend lot of money on accomodation ; shop etc . unless you be contribute to the economy ; either a a wage earner or a high spending tourist ; you be n't really welcome here . and if your parent be that age ; you should be visit them ; not vice versa .
 seniors both my parent as well a my inlaws have come here to visit our family . all 4 people be well in their 70 's ; so do n't think that be the rule .
 cruel condition for visa ? ? hello everybody ; i would like to know why they do n't allow for people over 63 y.o . to visit qatar . does it make any sense ?
 ah deedee it depend on your nationality ! ! !
 the medical liability be an issue for them . however ; you can get them to visit you . all you need be a special permission from the captain at the immigration .
 yes ; you need to talk to the authorised person in the visa office to get a special permission . i do for my mother and without any hassel he sign my document .
 i read a post from deedee that all his parent and the in-laws above 70 year be able to visit qatar . deedee it depend on your nationality and i know yours . it will not be the same for someone from asia . they should approach the concerend officers to special approvl for it .
 ah ! ! come on people ; the place where i be from be where a lot gulf citizen go seek a healthcare ! ! ! moreover ; i wo n't ask parent to come here if they be on a wheelchair ? ? ? ? both be still healthy and very well ; be john mccain 72 ? and a lot of political character over 65 ? are they entitle to have a visa to qatar ? ? anyway ; everyone come here to qatar hi be very likely to spend ; he will not come if he do n't spend ; and to `` rami-leb '' ... yeh you bet ; how could i forget such a solution ? i have to visit them ; thx for advice and i appreciate your idea > > > finally thx for every one have answer my q .
 well i do n't believe it have anything to do with the health care issue . first of all hmc only treat for free those who have a health card and therefore they must be resident not visitor ; if you do n't have a health card you 'll pay for whatever treatment you get except for emergency . second think let u say it be really all about health care issue and not provide the emergency case for free to sick elder who be none resident then simply the sponsor could be ask to sign a form where he will be responsible for any unsettled treatment payment for a visiting relative ; or perhaps those over a certain age could pay in the airport a health insurance fee ; instead of simply not allow the elderly -who should be treat with more respect honestly- to enter . after all what 's the median age of the parent of work resident here ? 40 ? i do n't think so . but a some people say it 's their roof ; their country ; let them do with it what ever they want .
 travelling by car is quite easy ; affordable and enjoyable . but a bit expensive comparing to bus travel . but this is quite easy and for the roads these are excellent . you will have to recheck your vehicle before travelling . especially the tyres . and even if you do n't know the routes ; just no problem ( either take gps or you will have to travel on the highway straight . and you can ask anyone on the gas station in the way ; they will guide you . travelling on your own car will be a great experience . have a nice trip thanks
 thanks to all of you for your favourable suggestion ... ... god bless you

 aussie meat hi ; where can i find aussie veal ; beef ; or lamb here at doha ?
 in pretty much every supermarket .
 and look around !
 why ? are you racist against pakistani lamb ?
 we be talk of m e a t ? my goodness ! what 's next moza ?
 they do have it in carrefour
 even the medium-size neighbourhood supermarket have .
 well ; i follow paleo diet ; therefore ; i be after grass fed meat which be likely impossible in qatar . i use to in australia where mostly cattle be grass fed . i know ; they ca n't export their grass feed animal because they do n't look healthy physically but still aussie meat will be somewhat grass-fed .
 peace !
 i guess ; you have to watch your word . pakistani grass fed animal be see in village only or in northern area ; they be not export to anywhere . most of the to-be-exported animal be feed corn or grain .
 vanmost ; now ; i do not know this for sure ; but i have be tell that meat from nz be all grass feed .
 aussie meat hi ; where can i find aussie veal ; beef ; or lamb here at doha ?
 and good luck do paleo here ... i would not even try to accomplish that here . it 's hard enough to find stuff for a normal diet .
 @ nomerci ... as i tell earlier ; grass fed animal do n't look healthy and they get yellow fat as well . therefore ; mostly importer do n't want that meat because consumer be not aware of fact . so ; every exporter have to give some grain and corn to animal even aussie and new zealanders also do . but still their meat be rich in omega 3 ... i know ; it will be hard to follow paleo or maybe i have to convert it into low carb ... but i will try my best : )
 i find the australian meat in doha tough . i buy nz beef and lamb . mandi
 aussies ; nz lamb with indian and pakistani . the a & nz be huge in size.. but the indians and pakistani'z be skinny ... . so which be the good one.. ( confuse ) ... dear moza frankly speaking i dont like those racist european and us meat ... they all be similar like you ... fill with poisons..
 section ?
 aussie lamb ? i hear they share their sheep : o (
 britexpat : here be the difference between lamb ; mutton or sheep http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lamb
 vanmost ; i find australian lamb at mira that be very fatty but so nice in taste . it be about 15 qr per kilo . when i read what you say about grass fed animal and how importer do not prefer it ; i think maybe that lamb be grass fed ; that 's why it 's less in price and have more fat . please reply because i be look for grass feed meat since i arrive in qatar last year but no way the store will tell you what kind of food animal have . if that mira lamb be grass fed it will be the great news for me ; since it taste nice and much less in price than other meat .
 check with elsenin at nasser street opposite to gardenia and gulf colour .
 forget our britexpat 's infamous cuban shotputter : )

 ptv sport on asiasat3
 it 's available on mozaic tv pahela channel .
 ok that 's annoy . i be not pay for a bunch of indian channel just for the cricket . will have to stick to watch it online then !
 the pehla tv be so worth it . cricone be do a great job have less commercial and more on-time sport coverage .
 20/20 world cup tv is the 20/20 world cup on any of the tv channel here ? i 've get most of the sport channel and it not on any of those !
 its get telecast on pehla package ... cricone ( channel 634 )
 i dont think they change the graphic card ... .they change the chip inside to use less power n generate less heat ... .like they do from falcon to jasper . havent see it in qatar yet ... take care : )
 i just saw one today ; in a store out here at the `` private airport '' how much be you willing to pay for it ?
 pay scale be what count ; not title .
 no dude profession be a factor
 no you ca n't get a visa if profession be labor ; if u change the profession then it will be possible simple .
 never ! ! unless u change your visa status to the require status by the labour dept such a office in charge ; manager ; engineer ; doctor etc ... or try something else .. guess : )
 it be possible . i know somebody whose profession be labour but have family here and own 3 car . fat bank account . mingle with society . do not say no if you do n't know real story .
 through proper channel no way ; it be well to change your profession first .
 labor profession be not allow to sponsor family either for visit visa or family visa .

 up up ..
 the same 35 qrs per person
 qr 35/- and if a 3d movie den need to pay qr 10/- extra for the glass
 k baba carry on
 thanks for the advice
 before or after a year ; it difficult to grant you one ; specially if your employer be qatari . be careful please . salam
 i suggest he/she secure a write approval or some evidence to testify his employer will release them . another qler post that after he drop the legal case he file against his employer ; who previously agree to release him but do n't pay his due ; they turn against him and deny the agreement . better be careful . salam
 hi fado given the situation between a certain two country i would not if i be you . i have hear of people be ask to leave qatar within 48 hour after ask for a transfer . you should inquire with other people from your home country here and they can fill you in on it . its politics again !
 you may have the noc on hand from your current sponsor ; but the immigration will not allow you to change your sponsor ; when you do not complete a 1 full year work visa with the same sponsor . and work with another company not your sponsor be certainly illegal .
 chaging work before the end of the 1st year be it possible to change job during your first year in qatar ? the current sponsor will give release and noc .
 if i 'm work for 6 month to may current sponsor and i will resign with noc ( release paper from my sponsor ) . as per advice to my next sponsor that i will exit to point of origin and they will just send the new visa & plane ticket this be possible ?
 that be possible . but your visa should be cancel by your sponsor and you need `` noc to return within the 2yrs ban period '' . note : noc to transfer sponsor be different from noc to return w/in 2yrs banned period .
 who will provide the `` noc to return within the 2 yr ban period '' ? be it the sponsor or immigration . tnx
 definitely ; your current sponsor . : )
 did you experience this situation coz i discuss the issue of some hr-pro the give me different answer the other one give me 95 % assurance that i will not be ban but other pro give 100 % assurance that it will be ok to transfer to other sponsor . with this two different assurance one thing the be in common that i will exit to my country of origin and back here in doha for new visa .
 you will be ban for 2yrs once your rp be cancel ; which be why you need to reassure that your current employer will grant you an noc to return . please note that your rp must be cancel prior to exit ; otherwise your new employer wont be able to apply a new visa for you . once you exit the state ; and with an noc on hand ; thing will be fine with you ; in god 's will ! but change sponsor within a year working of the same sponsor with a work visa/permanent visa stamp on your passport and without exit will not be possible for you a per immigration rules . you can double check with your company 's pro ; though .
 you will be able to change sponsorship within the first year . that be the answer i be give when i try in 2004 even though the company be prepared to give me an noc and i have another job and sponsor line up .
 yes ; it be possible . i have see a guy ; who change after 8 month of his joining . in that case ; 1 . the first sponsor do give an noc 2 . the second sponsr be a strong ; repute one in the abvoe criterion ; it can be possible .
 guy ; no need to doubt it ! i have changed the sponsorship within 1 year . i personally . as the matter of fact ; my rp be just `` 5 month old '' at that time ... apple ; noc be noc . it mean the previous sponsor do not mind you to work for another company . you can either transfer your sponsorship right away ; even within 1 year ; sometimes even without leave qatar ; or you can leave qatar ; to find another job and come back any time without wait till 2 year ban be over . all the guy need be noc letter . and hey ; it 's good not to belong to very few nationality when a someone say ; he might be ask to leave qatar within 48 hour . but this be a different story and have nothing to do with noc ; or duration of work with the previous sponsor . some people try to just renew their rps and ask to leave country . so get a noc and good luck with your new job ! < i > < b > ********************* you become responsible forever for what you have tame . antoine de saint-exupry < /b > < /i > < img src= '' http : //cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif '' >
 qs ; you be always special dahlin ; no doubt on that ; ) ) now i have this thought in mind ; do the law base on some nationality too ? because normally ; like dweller say ; you can not make it possible w/in a yr. ? at least that 's what we 've be tell .
 chaging work before the end of the 1st year be it possible to change job during your first year in qatar ? the current sponsor will give release and noc .
 apple ; someone ask me once : what be the immigration/labour rule in qatar ? my answer be simple : rule # 1 ( and often the only 1 ) : `` there be no rule '' . what be perfectly work for one ; irrespective of one nationality ; gender ; age ; religion ; political preference ; etc . ; might not work for another ; irrespective of anothers nationality ; gender ... see above : ) ... moreover ; whatever work for one person once ; might not work for the same person next time ( with the same name ; same passport number ; same nationality ; same gender.. see above.. ) so ; when the quest start from `` is it possible ... ? `` ; the answer be `` everything be possible '' . and that be my point ; dear : ) how be you anyway ? long time < i > < b > ********************* you become responsible forever for what you have tame . antoine de saint-exupry < /b > < /i > < img src= '' http : //cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif '' >
 oh ! very well dear ; tnx for ask : ) you seemingly right . it just appear to be the rule do n't really apply to everyone . but then ; allow me to add one more rule here ; that be sooo common . rule # 2 `` wasta '' : p
 im in ! : d
 join in minion !
 the general ql member will suffer a huge loss if chose to leave them ..
 sign me up !
 let 's do it
 came across several group a such ; but the initiator could n't conjure the energy to take it to the next step .
 hgl ; you have to build it . you ca n't just sit and wait until the nest be prepare for you . unless ; of course ; this be your mentality . but then you would be the first wrong member in this group .
 uncivilised way of talk on an initiative for a civilised group without understand what be say ... .dont know who would be a wrong member . anyways ; keep your smartness to yourself and do n't spoil a good initiative unless you have something positive to contribute .
 civilized group ? anyone interested of set up a civilize group ? in a sense where nobody be bias or one-sided ? where we can have rational and all rounded conversation without any side bash the other ? anything from everyday talk to book ; news and the hunt of spirit baby in africa ? organizing out and such .
 let make it work
 i can not make out any head or tail of what go on in kk show same a i couldnt make out anything about big boss and another reality show back home . the two reality show back home mention be cheap ; vulgar and may be thats what make them popular . i do watch them once a while to keep myself aware of what these be all about .
 am in for that group ! !
 well i be just read the previous reply . it just seem we be start it with a big kick in the behind . @ nomerci ; i guess yes we should put some guideline ; i 'd just hate be in the company of people who would just start throw talk offensive to one 's intellect or humanity without any specific rational reason . @ britexpat i ca n't seem to remember shove any information without any evidence .
 it would be more reasonable if we start a group in ql then start organize get out from then .
 @ nomerci it just seem you have be watch too many posh movie ! civilized mean be human . and be human be sum up by not be a a c*nt
 yeah me too.. my vote go to nomercy.. to name a group 'civilized ' seem offensive and discriminating..
 funny ; so you mean it 's offensive to call the 21st century `` a civilized century '' ? am i miss something ? and yes i do not think people shove and force their own opinion unto others be civilize ; therefore we be not interested in a group that contain such people . hard to understand ?
 @ azilana `` it 's how they respond.. '' exactly ; and that really betray be civilize .
 it 's their passion ; strong belief/opinion and desire to sway the other party to agree with them ... now that be worth discuss . : )
 civilized group ? anyone interested of set up a civilize group ? in a sense where nobody be bias or one-sided ? where we can have rational and all rounded conversation without any side bash the other ? anything from everyday talk to book ; news and the hunt of spirit baby in africa ? organizing out and such .
 @ azilana sometimes the `` discussing '' option be not available like in many country such a indonesia and iraq during saddam 's time . and some case include qatar ; but qatar and uae be less strict than say saudi arabia .
 their culture and belief ... and stick to the topic ; it 'll be a healthy discussion . it be possible before ... why ca n't it be now ? i guess the type of people who post then and the one currently active have different mindset . : )
 seriously this question be like ; let 's say you blosted i know your an athiest ; and let 's say me i be religious ; now here be a question we talk about a topic let 's say we talk about the big bang theory ( not the tv show xd ) ; my belief and your belief be go to crash ; in which it would become uncivilized ; so i think thier should be like a safe word or something be to end the discussion .
 @ gmz21 i 'm sorry but you ca n't mess around with the big bang theory ; since it 's only one agree upon theory . if you try to change some technical fact of the theory ; everyone be happy as long a you get the evidence . but theory do not depend about how you see them ; they be what they be ; not what we perceive them to be . unfortunately for the conspiracy theorists lol .
 mutawa from both side or only one side ?
 @ xena i 'm also sick of people go around deny fact and try to stuff in their own information with fallacious argument that be in no way evidence base . like people who think that afghanistan or iraq would have be good without western intervention or like holocaust denier ; it just seem these conspiracy theory be the result of their ( unfortunately ) religious belief . i mean why do n't these people deny the armenian genocide ? because it simply do n't have anything to do with jews or such . and that 's the group of people i be just sick tire to debate with .
 i just ca n't get the `` culture and belief '' argument through ! i mean we be talk about how shoving thing down one 's throat be not a fancy thing to do ; and when it 's do you 'd just call it culture or belief ? nonetheless that be certainly not a civilized thing to do .
 why do n't people get back to work and do something constructive rather than argue into cyberspace ? ? ?
 @ stealth say so just show your ignorance about the fascist reign of saddam hussein which force you to see your family while get execute by shoot squad and still would force you to smile and clap with a big smile .
 you know that a theory could be prove wrong by the tiny thing why their call theory not facts ; and that be false the most agreed theory be the pythagorean theory which be still a theory . i never state i do n't find the big bang theory incorrect you just begin attack man ; i be use it a an example . like if you want a civilized discussion you should try to understand both side of the argument . example would be the iraq war you know what iraqis say now ; with saddam their be safety but no freedom ; but without saddam we have freedom but no safety . this do n't mean that you 're wrong or that stealth be wrong ; you be both right . you believe now they can vote and not be scar of their government official . while stealth believe now there be a very high rate of crime ; which be n't around the time during saddam 's time .
 civilized group ? anyone interested of set up a civilize group ? in a sense where nobody be bias or one-sided ? where we can have rational and all rounded conversation without any side bash the other ? anything from everyday talk to book ; news and the hunt of spirit baby in africa ? organizing out and such .
 what do big bang have to do with evolutionary biology ! damn professional ninja thread hijacker ! who love dog !
 yawn.. whats with the attitude dude.. why be someone here react constipated.. like a grade school adviser.. im watch dawkins ; he really smart.. yawn ...
 lol be that a pun ?
 for sure.. wallah just take it easy dude.. civilize group mate.. civilize group.. yawn.. let rest ; have 20m qr wait to be bill tomorrow.. ciao..
 oh ! i suddenly love you now ! tell me do you have 1m qr ? i need it for euh ... .i forget my wallet .
 it sound good ; but whats the purpose ? ? i mean be civilized be a quality ; not a common interest to form a group . if we really want to make a group ... . let find a common interest . a topic that inspire most of the people to participate . though i like your intent ... i find it impractical . best of luck ! cheers !
 no one be argue with with the saddam issue we all know how bad he be ; but you have to remind yourself what be the reason for the iraq war ; george w. bush state `` weapons of mass destruction '' ; but back then most iraqis ( again the people who live in iraq not american soldiers or media ) ; state it be safer to walk in the street at night ; and now it 's unsafe to walk in the morning . now yes saddam do horrible thing i should know i live in kuwait ; i be bear in kuwait and i be barely 3 year when the gulf war invasion happen . so my parent tell me story ; and their family . but if you think it 's safe in iraq now ; your information be be bias that america do the best ; thing they could .
 @ gmz21 no one be argue that the americans do a blow job ; they always do ; but at least now woman get right and girl and boy can finally get school . i mean it 's a start for a free society ; but whatever it be i do n't think be threaten 24/7 by a fascist leader make it any safer . maybe it be safer to walk at night because there be n't much `` freedom fighter '' or much extremist active back then for the sole reason that they be afraid or collaborate with saddam . but get rid of them will take effort and time and it should not stop now . @ deadman123 common interest be not a problem ; there be no specific interest but what we want be a enjoyable group which be very practical .
 maybe the iraqi have so much pride in thmeselves that some western power be the one who get rid of saddam rather than themselves . by them i mean the same people fight the american now who happen to be the same people cower in their house when saddam crony use to pass by . yep . that must be it . pride . same with the afghan i think .
 ignore what i have post except the happy new year part ; because 1 . i do n't feel like argue 2 . if there be any chance of be friend i 'd rather not mess that up ; because of some silly argument .
 civilized group ? anyone interested of set up a civilize group ? in a sense where nobody be bias or one-sided ? where we can have rational and all rounded conversation without any side bash the other ? anything from everyday talk to book ; news and the hunt of spirit baby in africa ? organizing out and such .
 and the pot call the kettle black ? ? ? ?
 be it some kind like interest group ? ?
 i do n't believe most conspiracy theory that arabs bring up . but i swear my american teacher make me believe the 9/11 conspiracy theory .
 i agree with azilana ; attitude and make sure you be educate determines how civilize you be . everyday you learn something new ; hopefully we learn how to better co-exist and get along . sign me up .

 1 ) your passport copy 2 ) your rp and id 3 ) your brother passport 4 ) your company noc 5 ) your house agreement 6 ) typed arabic papaer 7 ) 200 qr
 your passport copy 2 ) your rp and id 3 ) your brother passport 4 ) your company noc 5 ) your house agreement 6 ) typed arabic papaer 7 ) 200 qr dont forget to attach your marriage certificate also because you be not allow to sponsor your brother if you be not marry and at the same time your family should be here with valid residence visa because if you be single ; immigration will not allow you . the only thing you can do if you be single be to apply a tourist visa or business visa ...
 1- fill a family-visit-visa aplication form ( online or at any typist for 5 qr ) preferably in arabic 2- passport copy of yours and your visitor 's ; 3- company letter state -your salary ( must be > 5.000qr ) and -that they provide u family accomodation ( if not ; provide no.4 ) and -no objection from your sponsor that u bring ur family for visit . 4- rental contract ( stamp by baladiya ? ) 5- qr . 200 processing fee for each visa but in credit card ; no cash at jiane ; ur wrong . i 'm single and i bring my parent every year .
 to drsam : you are wrong also because parents are exempted to sponsored by a bachelor . if you want to sponsor a brother or sister ; you should be married and your family is here living with you ...

 still not work : (
 you can hard reset your wireless router by press the small button at the back with a paper clip ; but you will need to re-configure the router - anyway it just username and password for the adsl setting you just have to obtain that information before do the hard reset . < a title= '' everything you need to know about living in doha ; qatar '' href= '' http : //www.qatarliving.com '' > < img src= '' http : //static.qatarliving.com/badges/150x50 '' alt= '' everything you need to know about living in doha ; qatar '' / > < /a >
 plumkiwi i dont think there be any problem with the router coz i be use same connection on ma laptop with the same security setting ... wot d u say ?
 i didnt say there be problem with the router . it with the security maybe your pda doesnt authenticate with security encryption well disable it first to verify . or good yet try change your security mode to `` wep '' encryption `` 10/64-bits '' . < a title= '' everything you need to know about living in doha ; qatar '' href= '' http : //www.qatarliving.com '' > < img src= '' http : //static.qatarliving.com/badges/150x50 '' alt= '' everything you need to know about living in doha ; qatar '' / > < /a >
