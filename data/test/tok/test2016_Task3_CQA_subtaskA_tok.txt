We unfortunately adopted a kitten that had ringworms and had rash on her nose and other parts of the body . The new kitten gave all of the family ringworm rash leaving permanent marks on the body from this . We have had her treated and now she is fine . Where as we fully understand that QAWS is a fully voluntry organisation ; but we feel that they could have advised us more about the health of the little kitten .

Not being vets we have NEVER told an adopter that the animal they are adopting is 100 % fully fit and healthy unless they have been to a vets . We have apologised for any inconvenience and even offered to take the kitten back into the shelter which you declined .

The players take it in turn to bounce the ball off the surface ; then pick up jacks ; then catch the ball before it bounces twice . There are variants on this procedure . Sometimes the ball is thrown into the air rather than bounced . Sometimes it is bounced against a wall or target ; if that is in the vicinity of play . Sometimes no bounce is allowed at all . In some variants ; the players must pick up as many jacks as possible in each turn . Perhaps more commonly ; the number of jacks to be picked up is pre-ordained and sequential : at first you must pick up one ( onesies ) ; next two ( twosies ) ; and so on . In most versions of the game ; only one hand may be used . To simplify play ; both may be used ; to make it harder ; or to impose a handicap ; a player might be required to use their off-hand ( eg ; the left if right-handed ) . http : //en.wikipedia ... ...

I 've been looking into the number of people coming to Qatar and the supply of property for some time . What is interesting is that demand is likely to continue to outstrip supply for the next 4-5 years . After this point ; the Pearl ; Lusail and other developments will come fully on stream and then I suspect property prices will come down as there will be enough supply . But on the other hand ; Qatar is similar to how Dubai was in the mid 1990s . The potential is really impressive in the long term so real estate in Qatar is a good investment . As far as Lusail goes - I 've consistently heard that it is running behind schedule and will not be completed on time . The first new development which will be ready seems to be the Zig Zag towers in June/July .

In my case getting rid of the Exit permit thing is a big bonus .

You can blow off 9000Qr in a week ; a month ; or be able to save up to 4000 QR out of it per month . You can rent a car for around 1600-1800 QR per month ; but I would recommend buying a second hand car or a brand new one if you plan to stay here for 3-4 years ; and you can pay around 750-1000QR per month and own the car . For food and personal expenses ; 2000-3000QR is what you need so you will end up having 1000QR to shop with ; and 4000QR to save ! Email me if you need more info ; use my profile to email me .

During the interview process ; an applicant realise how good he / she was in answering questions being raised . An applicant should be able to impress HR that he is not only the best candidate but the only suitable candidate for the job . If you are able to impress HR then you can demand . How much you are worth ? It all depends on YOU . Every company has a salary scale ( minimum - maximum ) for each and every job however ; if you are worth more ; demand .

I am just putting everything into picture ; HMC hired many nurses in last 2 years . When they came they were offered either housing or housing allowance . Almost all took housing allowance ; then they called their families on visit visa ; once their husbands found a job in qatar ; they want to forfeit housing allowance and instead they want a house from HMC . This means thousands of units and this is not an easy job and plus estimate the rent . By and large HMC has been favourable to its employs ; i know many hospitals in gulf do not allow females to bring their families . Plus not so long ago ; no organization in qatar was even giving housing allowance to females ; they either get single accomodation or nothing at all .	Good	U5246	superdoc	2008-07-10 12:44:20

It costs only 20riyals ( to and from the island ; includes the entrance fee ; i suppose ) drow boat ride . There you can relax in a lounger under the shade of the trees ; watching the others swin ; play volleyball or the children play in the sand . And since the beach side faces to the sea ... you 'll feel like you 're in a tropical island away from QATAR ( my opinion ) . waiters are ready to take your food order . Read a book while you smoke sheesha . If you get hungry ; there was a seafood restaurant for you to dine in ...

So what happened was that I was failing ; and in order to pass I needed to put all the other nerds in the course to sleep . But those jerks would study all day and never sleep and I was very much worried about the health effects on them for not sleeping . In the end I told my professor of the Pressure on those students ; so he gave all of them A Grades and me got B grade . Here is what happened in the exam . After one hour had passed in the exam ; he told us if anyone of you wants to leave ; he can leave and he will get a B . So I happily left . I was the only one to leave .

I took me two visits to the service center before i give up and started taking it to other oil changing shops . besides ; the car has many manufacturing defects ( according to a friend he is still facing them in his new model ) : CD player ; brake system ... At the time when I bought it it was the only car with 7 seaters with a very reasonable price ( 67000 ) ; but finally It would have been better for me if i bought a pajero or a pathfinder . On the top of all that the resale value of the suzuki is not so encouraging .	Good	U1819	Gus	2007-01-09 23:06:17

As a general rule most UK brands ( such as BHS ; Next ; M & S ; H & M ) are priced at an exchange rate of QR7 to £1 . As the current rate is closer to QR5 to £1 clothes will be cheaper in the UK . On top of this retailers are discounting heavily in the UK because of the recession . If you look at some French or Spanish brands ( Zara ) they are cheaper in Doha .

I was wired up all over the place ; which for me was n't too comfortable ; and then left to 'sleep ' ... which I did very little of anyway as I did n't like the 'wiring ' . I was also diagnosed by the Maxillo Facial Surgeon ; who checked the size of my jaw ; tongue etc etc ; and noted that this was one of the causes of my apnoea . I did n't do the 'sleeping pills run ' as I had an operation instead to alter my jaw and remove a bit of my tongue ( sounds gross ; but was n't really that bad ) .

Anything with bubbles can activate the brain instead of allowing it to sleep . Also ; chocolate is a sleep depriver too .

Most folk do n't think about the chocolate biscuit with a cuppa ; late on in the day ; but that 's saying goodbye to sleep ! regardless of what stress you are or are n't under .

Has anybody got jobs via these online sites ?	U5687	sharpshooter	2010-10-08 09:33:41	Q337_R4_C2	these sites definitely reflect the lack of understanding of recruitment in people who designed them what they do is to match you on very limited criteria such as the last industry you worked in . What I mean is : if for example you 've worked in Oil & Gas for years ; but your last job ( even just 6 momths ) was in pharmaceuticals ; then they will match you with pharmaceuticals ! Working in HR I look on CVs posted on Gulf Talent only in desperate times and to be honest never employed anyone through these web sites . So ; if you 're looking for a job ; I would suggest uploading your CV on Gult Talent or Bayt just in case you get lucky ; but spend most of your efforts applying directly through companies ' web sites and going in to the companies to hand in your CV .

Now they say yes no problem ; call back to confirm the details ; call the day before to remind me and call when he is on the way . I have never had a problem with the drivers except sometimes they are clearly under a lot of pressure and stressed . Maybe people could show some compassion for the drivers who live under difficult conditions so you get a cheap service . By the way I find the blatant racism on this website offensive .

The Western media has an inherent bias ; which is very subtle . Israeli forces are called : IDF ( Israeli Defense Forces ) Whereas ; a Palestinian child throwing a rock at an Israeli tank passing through his family orchard is a `` '' Future terrorist '' '' I dont support either the soldier or the rock-thrower . However ; I believe in calling a spade a spade . That 's why a magazine like `` '' The Economist '' '' is respectable and a media source like `` '' Fox News '' '' or `` '' CNN '' '' is a farce to promote the bias inherent in their owners . The Internet ; howvere ; has changed all that by breaking the monopoly of content generation and content dissipation . : - ) zaki the duckie ''	PotentiallyUseful	U5503	zakiduckie	2008-02-11 14:39:52

The employer will exit the employee to a nearby country ; saying that they will just fix the work visa but in reality ; they will already terminate the employee .

The problem arises in the Immigration in Philippines . They will ask lots of questions and squeeze in some out of nowhere questions.. Just be prepared and act one that knows the Law.If you fail to pass thru the immigration ; they will definitely get the last penny you have in you pocket . I felt bad to some people who are a victim of this . There was already a report in yahoo maktob stating how cruel the immigration officers in asking for some money for the individual to get out of the country ! Are n't they supposed to let that person pass peacefully ? I hate to say this but ; my tax when I was still working in Manila ; paid them well enough ... so they should serve us well and with respect instead of bullying us for the sake of money ! : D Just my 2 cents here !

There is a heavy abuse of the Business visa concept . Filipinos find their ways to buy this type of visa for the purpose of coming to Qatar and searching a job here . Which is illegal . Your immigration fellows only use your own criminal approach to this matter . One part of the mafia is buying the illegal visas . Another part of the mafia wants to have their fat piece out of it . Simple . YOUR own criminal action leads to your immigration officers’ criminal actions . YOU ALL are involved in this vicious circle ; as one criminal group . STOP buying the illegal visas ; and this will cut the ground from under the feets of your fellow-immigration officers ; and they will stop demanding thier share . Sunny ; as an exception ; it does not apply to you . Unlike others ; you got your business visa legally ; issued by your hiring Company .

Certain laws and regulations change ; and it can be a frustrating place ; but on the whole you can live a very nice life here . I moved from London ; and adjusted pretty easily . Come with an open mind and you 'll be fine . There are plenty of people in the same position and you 'll meet other expats easily . What I will say ; is you have to build your life here and it can be an easy place to hate if you do n't make the effort ... .especially for the wife . Hopefully she 's outgoing ; and it should n't be a problem to meet people . Choosing where to live is a big part !

Look at Bombay Company in the Mall and their US website and compare the prices . We wanted a bed that cost 17 ; 000 riyals in their shop here and on the US website $ 1000 ; exact same bed . The silly ( Lebanese ) manager at the Mall shop said no discount ; only for repeat customers ! They wanted to maintain exclusivity . I think he meant the exclusivity of fleecing gullible customers or the exclusion of reason . One of the two . Even if I were to ship it from the US it would be cheaper buying it from the website .

Q346_R26	Doha Shopping	Where can I buy curtains in Qatar ?	My wife was recently quoted QR4k by a shop on Salwa Rd to do one ( ONE ! ) window ! As we 've got about ten to do ; I 'd really rather not have that sort of outlay . I 'd like to get 'proper ' ones ; with hooks at the top and a pulley on the side ; but so far all we 've seen is guys who want to prey on expats or that service Qataris ; to whom money is no object .

I made a mistake bring my own furniture as I was recommended to bring.But the shipment container was paid for so I do n't mind .

Chances are good he himself might be an owner of a pickup . If not he would definitely arrange one for you . Or if you could drive down to Alfardan bus stand ; you can find such big pickups parked in line with pathans sitting in the driving seats . The rate will obviously depend on from where you have to pickup your furniture and where to drop ; but it should be within or around QR100 . Bargaining will possibly bring down what you end up paying . One word of caution ! Used furnitures are the primary source of blood sucker bed bugs .	Good	U578	flexicode	2011-01-28 22:11:11

But when you eat in the hotel ... you will easily spent QR 600 to QR 700 ; on top of that they will charge you another 17 percents ... and you still have to leave 10 percents for the tip ? but then again if you can afford to pay the bill ... surely you can afford to leave some $ $ $ for tipping ? ? ?

U5197	qatar_2008	2008-03-28 00:09:57	Q351_R11_C9	I think it 's very rare for the service charge included in the bill to go to the waiters . I do n't even know if 'service ' actual means the waiter service . Best to ask the waiter if they get it or not . If they do n't then leave a tip if you think they deserve it ; for the amount you think they deserve . I hate the American culture of always tipping . A normal tip should reward normal service ; with a bigger tip rewarding service above your expectations . But if the service is poor ( as it so often is here ) then they have n't earnt a tip in my opinion .	Good	U429	tallg	2008-03-28 09:04:05

If you are going to your accommodation ; malls and shops are open late now with it being Ramandan ( 1 am or so ) . Ask your driver for advice .

However ; as you 're just arriving in the country ; no one is expecting you to have riyals ready to distribute . Or I 'd hope not . Besides ; the ATM spits out bigger bills than you 'd tip to a driver ( as in every country ; UK included ) . So then you 'd have the trouble of having to get one broken down . If you 're going to the hotel ; and you really want to tip the driver ; just ask him to wait for a second . Run in ; tell them what you want to do ; and change a bill . Or borrow 10 riyals from the bellhop ; tell them you 're changing money in just a second ; and then give it back after you 've changed money . Truthfully ; though ; I would n't sweat it too much . You 'll have other things to occupy yourself with . Which hotel ? The Intercon is quite nice . The breakfast buffet is gigantic . Literally 15 kinds of bread ( at least ) . Fresh fruit juices . A whole long table filled with fruit and cheeses .	Good	U1920	namabiru	2007-09-26 03:48:55

Do n't respond to emails ; never answer a direct question ; and do n't return calls . They do n't permit staff to access Internet resources regardless of need for job .

What I do not understand though is why certain Palestinian factions continue to fire home made rockets into Israel . What good does it do ? It takes away sympathy from the Palestinian cause and it causes innocent deaths on the Israeli side of the border . Worse of all ; everyone knows that the Israelis retaliate with much greater force and cause many more innocent palestinian deaths . Stop giving Israel an excuse to kill . Use brain power not gun powder . Look to the examples of Ghandi and Mandela to make change and get the Isrealis to return to 1967 borders . These stupid rockets just cause more unecessary deaths .

Hello Folks ; I am Lebanese Male with more than 7 years GCC experience 5 Dubai 2+ in Qatar ; I have been looking for a job in a good high reputable company where I can feel secure in Qatar ; Doha ... . Unfortunately All the job interviews or offers I get are totally bad . is it that hard to get a good job in Qatar or what ? if you could guys provide me with a good recruiting company or name of any good company that hiring now . Thank you .	U3	anonymous	2012-09-17 22:59:09	Q361_R1_C1	Hey ! Welcome to Qatar . Every job market has its fair share of positives and negatives . Getting a job in qatar is quite tough depending on the channel you use to source for jobs . Also depends on your expectations . There is vast majority of job seekers in Qatar who consider themselves qualified in many ways but often find out that the expectations of the employer are much higher . Also ; you should try to be more specific . For eg : in the question you placed ; you could have easily mentioned what kind of position you are looking out for to let everyone know in one go . But you chose not to . In addition to this ; most ministries and govt organizations are implementing qatarization policies . So you will find a decrease in very 'high paying ' jobs for expatriates . The private firm would not probably pay you as much . To avoid dissapointment you could try to filter the interviews coming to you . Ask before-hand what to expect in the interviews . The sources of recruitment / agencies are easily access ... ..	Good	U4113	crazy88	2012-09-17 23:37:59

Tepgam67 ; if you have an RP here ; to obtain a Work permit you need police clearance and the contract certified in MOL .

Are husbands able to get a work permit ? And what papers will they ask for ; is a police clearance letter necessary ? Thanks .	U5919	angryfrog	2010-07-30 14:47:47	Q365_R53_C3	if you get over 7k you can sponser him with fam visa . once he is here and under your visa ; He should bring a police clearance report from his home country ( need to be attested by his Embassy here ) so let him find a job ; he will need to give the police clearance report and the company will fix him a work visa . ( not the same as yours ) he will still remain under your sponsorship . or different option if his job is well paid and he will get good benefits like tickets and also housing allowance he can ask his new employer to be his sponsor	Good	U3	anonymous	2010-07-30 17:46:59

Even IF you are able to bring him on a Family visit visa ( 6 months ) ; he wo n't be able to work with this type of visa . The Company who hired him will have to issue a Work Visa for him and will have to take him under its sponsorship . As for the Residence permit ; you wo n't be able to obtain RP for him ( which is necessary for the Work permit ) under your sponsorship . So this is not an option for you . All you need is to TRY to bring him on Family visa 6 months . THen he will need to find a job and to move under the hiring company sponsorship .	Good	U78	qatarisun	2010-07-31 16:26:20

I think the problem is if someone has started a serious thread ; which requires a discussion or even an answer to a query they have ( if it does n't fit in the more serious forums ) ; then by hijacking it kind of kills the thread and serves no purpose . Speaking as someone who found this site when in the UK ; before coming over to Doha ; I typed into google a question about ; say ; sports clubs in Doha and found a thread in QL . It was informative ; but I wonder what I would have thought of the site had the thread suddenly disintegrated in people gossiping and heresay and bickering ? For a start I would never had seen some of the REAL info I was looking for and given up ; as probably would have the person who posted the question in the first place expecting some knowledge to be imparted !

But if someone goes on the current trend of TIGHT fitting ones with shiny stones and designs ; without the Hijab ; and with DRAG makeup or in some cases they just let it all fly back while they walk into a mall making it look like an advocate coat . So whats the purpose of wearing the Abaya again ; if you want to show your body to the world ? lol ; when I see the other nationalities wearing an abaya apparently they dont do it to cover their body ; they do it to look pretty and to look Qatari : ) Correct me if Im wrong . Hope your not one among these people . Once I was in Landmark and I saw a Qatari ( I guess ) with an open Abaya wearing Super man tee inside . What the devil did she want to potray ?

Practice this until you are no more ; and no less than 180 degrees from when you started . . . . . 2 . Learn how to countersteer by ripping the handbrake from a speed of 10-20mph and trying to control the car to a destination until the car stops . . . . . 3 . Increase speed of each of these things until you are comfortable . . . . . . 4. try to do the 180 cone turn but instead of stopping ; hit the gas hard and power out and away from the cone .

Do n't you think it 's also young men in their land cruisers also belting along roads at break neck speeds ? and some people of both genders just racing into roundabouts without even bloody looking ? Why just this morning on my way into work ; a qatari gentleman in a really nice car basically barged into me and we would have had quite a bad crash if i had n't been polite enough to just stop and let him in rather than have most of my car side taken off by him . I think it 's more a case of many problems on the roads of qatar taht really need to be taken care of ! And go Gulf Times for at least starting publicity on this subject- even if they have highlighted something we were all familiar with in the first place .	Good	U3	anonymous	2009-07-21 08:17:52

My daughter has gone there for 2 years now . I like it a lot . You 'll have to drive but it 's pretty much a straight shot from the QF area . You basically have to drive everywhere here .

This is true that these days it is difficult to find accommodation but if you ask your employer to provide you with the accommodation this will be the best solution . I am sure you will never regret the decision.Abu Dhabi has a future with so many real projects in pipeline and specially for a Quantity Surveyor with UK experience this job can be the base for other better opportunities . Good luck and go for it . Take my advise dont focus on present cost of living as these are highly volatile and misleading when I decided to come over in Doha April this year ; it was based on good savings but in realty I found it other way round . I think when deciding about taking a job in Gulf ; criteria these days should be better opportunity and quality of life and these two things no other city in Gulf provides except great Abu Dhabi .

That there is more to PM than the traditional ways adopted . Especially since its done in a structured n organised manner and in international terms which ppl fr all over can understand and identify with . Having the PMP will empower U to take on PM jobs more confidently . Of cos experience also counts .

You go directly onto the entrance of the bowling centre . Now about the price ; It is the cheapest in the middle east . It is QR 10 for the first game and QR 8 for each subsequent games ( i am not sure about it ) . On Fridays and other weekends ; you may have to book in advance .

In Doha ; last summer -when my family was out of Qatar ; i was at office on friday and wanted to go to carrefour to buy something-villagio security blocked me .

They too have family days ; and even in the parks only families are allowed . Next ; i have been to the malls all by myself and noone ever stopped me on a friday . Irrespective of what time i went .

The pay level depends upon the needs of the job ; not on your qualifications . $ 25K QR plus benefits is actually a really high classification level ; i think as a Senior Manager / Director type of position . $ 16 ; 000 QR is more than many teachers make in Doha ; so I would think that is probably a good salary ; but again it depends on the job . The Housing and transport allowance makes up for any salary discrepancies you might encounter . QF is pretty fair about pay ; and is an employer of choice in Qatar .

The best advice I can give you is ask to speak to a manager ( in the admininstration department ; not just a floor section manager in the store ) next time you are there ; and inquire about the brand specifically . And IF for some reason they did stop carrying it ; you should be able to find them in other stores ( unless the whole country decides to ban them for whatever reason ) . Hope that helps . Stay safe .

The Grand Hyatt is well underway by the Ritz ; it 's supposed to resembel the Sharq Village and Spa . Word on the Street is that La Cigale came here with the promise that they would be allowed to serve pork by opening and now the powers that be are going back on their word ; which is causing problems . `` `` I fight with love and I laugh with rage ; you have to live light enough to see the humor and long enough to see some change .

The Center was the only decent large shop and it had BHS as one of its franchises although many of the items for sale were not BHS products ; just BHS labels sewn on in the wrong place . There was a Shwarma stall in the car park and a cafe inside that served many dishes . Both were operated by `` '' The Caravan '' '' . The only other shop of any size was Salam Studios ; on Al-Saad Street . Now the site of the QP offices and HSBC . Salam Plaza did n't open until the early/mid 80 's I seem to recollect .

I do remember going with my Mum to the souq for shopping ( spices ; perfumes ; material for clothing ; nuts ; etc ) Now they deliver to us ! But we still go once in a while . I remember going to Europe a few times a year ( staying in our houses in London and Paris and travelling around ) and we would always have a long list of things to buy and take back . Clothes ; shoes ; medicines ; foodstuffs ... endless list . Now the list is shorter as there is so much more available to buy in Doha and online buying with shipping is easier . Some of my older relatives remember Doha as a walled city with a curfew at night . Someone came along to light the gaslamps ( ? ) at sunset and during Ramadan someone came through the streets at Suhoor time to wake everyone up to eat before the fasting began for the day .
