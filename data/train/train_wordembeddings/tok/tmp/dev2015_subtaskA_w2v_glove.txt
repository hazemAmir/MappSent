 from dubai to qatar i be currently work here in dubai and i get an offer from qatar company.. they offer 8000qar +camp accommodation +meal and transportation be provide by the company ... will this be enough to accept the offer ? how good be the transportation there in qatar ?
 if you be single then it ok you can enjoy .
 depends on where the accommodation is.. how many people will live with you ; what kind of food . why dont u ask your company to provide you transportation and ask for 4k more a accommodation and food allowance . most importantly ; 8k isnt a great salary but it all again depend on your job profile and work experience .
 if the company be from oil and gas industry or work for that industry ; then their accommodation and transport will be well . if it be normal construction company ; they dont have good facility . as far a your question of salary be concern ; you dont need to ask ; a dubai be not so different from qatar and the currency be also the same .
 transport in the city be a nightmare .
 and life her be so relaxed that bachelor be exclude from many venue on 'family days . '
 it basically mean 'sharing ' . the bathroom ; the kitchen ; the bedroom . so ; privacy adieu .
 if you 're here to work ; eat ; and sleep . no problem .
 like you share your room to 4 persons.. you get no privacy at all ...
 camp be temporary . so ; possibly porta cabin .
 i have filipino friend ; get 5000 qr and he have his family also with him and 3 yr old kid . do n't worry ; you can manage .
 from dubai to qatar i be currently work here in dubai and i get an offer from qatar company.. they offer 8000qar +camp accommodation +meal and transportation be provide by the company ... will this be enough to accept the offer ? how good be the transportation there in qatar ?
 ok ... thank you again ...
 8k ++ be okay eeyouth . just ask about the camp accom . if it 's porta cabin and you be use to this then good . if not ; then ask them about housing allow . but if your work place be in messaeeid or ras laffan ; well take the camp accom . these place be far from doha .
 hehehe grab it and meet me in ramada heeheheh
 the camp at ndia be not too bad . cabins be only a few year old and there be plenty facility . transport will be the yellow bus between camp and site - about 15 minute drive max . taxis tend not to call there so get out on your own can be a hassle unless you get pally with a kabayan with a pickup truck at his disposal ! if the salary be same a you get in dubai you should be able to save more here .
 try badminton.. you will see the difference..

 increment of price in qatar - official ? discussing with my company regard annual increment of allowance . is there any official statistic about increment of price in qatar ? something official statistic agency ; central bank of qatar or similar ?
 there have be much press lately about the drop in price ; food ; and especially housing price have be decrease . so if you bring up a need for an increase in your allowance and salary right now ; you probably wo n't get very far ; maybe even have allowance decrease ! there be something call the qatar statistics authority at http : //www.qsa.gov.qa/eng/index.htm may be helpful ; but not sure . the english spelling in their report be atrocious ; they even spell literacy wrong ! makes me wonder about error in their methodology and data collection if they ca n't get even that right .
 well ; discussion have to be base in something with an official `` smell '' . i check qsa and it report for -4 ; 6 % ( suppose the data from gulf times come from here ) . so this year i will pass on the issue without noise . lets talk next year : ) war look for peace ; be like fornication look for virginity .

 how much car value should go down ; one month old car i be sell one month old car ; 1600 km ; gmc yukon danali ; full option ; white the price of the car be around 230 ; 000 new . this be 2012 model . how much do you think it will be sell from new price ? car be excellent ; of course brand new ; even the plastic seat cover be on it .
 for others reduce by 15000 ; for friends/relatives by 25000 .
 at least 3000-5000 below the actual amount because a 1 month old car is still considered a new one with just 1600 km mileage ...
 20 % to 30 % value of the car will go down to attract the people otherwise they will go with the brand new car it 's only my idea .
 there be no specific rule other than : `` child less than 12 yr should not be seat in the front seat '' but if u put them in the back seat without safety seat nobody care . anyways if u have one bring it with you coz here the minimum cost be qr.300/-

 international bank qatar is the best bank here in doha sad story about other bank 's ...
 doha bank ... .the best
 if you have time and you 're a patient person ; please go for hsbc . it take in average 30 minute to reach someone when you call the customer service ! and if you call after 5 pm ; after wait 30 minute they will ask you to call the day after . another one from hsbc ; if you travel abroad ; they may eventually block your credit card ( for security reason ) and will inform you only when you be back in qatar . i be leave in thailand without be able to use my credit card and didnt have a single $ to buy food ! thanks to hsbc . i move to commercial bank ( cbq ) and i 'm very happy : - )

 hsbc be shock ! their customer service be horrendous ; and when you travel abroad they block your credit card ; even when you advise their card service department which country you be go to and which hotel you be stay in ! also ; if you call their customer service from abroad outside of office hour ; it go through to their uae call centre ; who say they can not help until the qatar office open again ! useless ; absolutley useless .

 if you come by taxi/cab ; you may tell driver to take lulu . he will take . if you be come with somone who do not lulu ; pls note lulu be between mall roundabdout and airport signal . you will not miss this with this descriptin .
 from tv r/a ; go to airport road via c-ring road . when you reach toyota tower signal ; turn right ( now you 're on airport road ) . on next signal ; turn right again ; ( now you 're on d-ring road ) . go straight ; then you 'll see lulu hypermarket on your left side . take you turn on the next r/a .

 judo i have be look for month for a judo club . there 's a federation here but when i contact them they couldnt really tell me where i could find a club for my son . it seem that judo be teach here in school but only for qatari ! there must be a club somewhere in doha that accept non qatari . does anyone know of a judo club ; my son be 5 year old . thanks
 thers ' also one in front of rawnaq in bin omran area .
 thanks for re-opening this question . no ! there be no private judo club except the federation without proper motivation for their player . the close thing that i saw be the one near to frinje naseer area . it be jujitsu club . as you know jujitsu be the first cousin of judo . i think i will enroll there ; cause i be become rusty a day passby . they be open in the evening .
 good day ! finally i find a judo club that start accordingly more than a year ago . the dojo be under umbrella of the karate academy in al sadd area near to jarir book store and doha clinic hospital . the timing of the practice be sun-tues-thurs at 18:30-19:45 under coach saeed who be a former qatar olympic player for 12yrs . if you be interested you can contact these no : 4421142 or 5220806 . enjoy the art of judo . good luck .
 dottymum ; sorry for the late reply . i teach judo at a school ; and no ; your child be too small for my club because five year old be the bare minimum to start judo ; otherwise ; the judo club become a day care . i would start with the qatari judo federation . they seem to be pretty good with the kid . i have n't work out with the adult player ; because they be always train elsewhere . but the few time i 've go to visit them ; there be kid work out . tunisians be the instructor ; and if your game to learn ( or already know ) french ; i would enroll them in their program . they seem very qualified . it 's an arabic/french class at one of the local sport club around the dafna area . let me know ; and i can try to get you contact with the right people .

 hochtief ; siemens be some of the german companies that come to mind that be establish here . why not send them your cv and check what they would offer ? just a thought to get a reasonable and close to precise salary scale and benefit .
 i 'm not acquaint with german work environment ; but the whole thing look like a joke to me . you be a civil engineer who dedicate at least 5 post-graduate year ( not work in parallel ) with no point or project behind your ph.d. thesis other than get the certificate ! ! ! ! ! ! and still you think that european degree be good than egyptian for instance .
 a ph.d. civil engineer be expect to have the same start salary a a b.sc . holder ! ! never to mention the expectation of the field work ; be he suppose to be a site engineer for example ? is n't he suppose to be work in the research field ? with this start salary for a ph.d. emg . in germany ; i 'd recommend you 'd better apply to a job in egypt .
 check out the follow site ; www.gulftalent.com and www.bayt.com ; and then apply to any engineering position that suit your qualification . try to get some offer first and then come back here and ask u whether the offer be good for you or not . good luck !
 thank you all ; i get contrary response ; some say 30 ; 000-40 ; 000 qr others say phd be like bsc and `` german phd mean nothing in the world anymore '' . could more member of this forum verify one of these statement ? by the way ; do work in scientific research count a work experience ? i mean i spend 5 year in laboratory do experiment for my research ; can i say i have laboratory experience now ?
 you ca n't claim that your phd = phd + 5 yrs experience ; jsut like that 5 yr experience < > 5 yr experience +phd . you can consider that phd = bsc + 3-4 yr experience . makes sense ? as for the egyptian comment ; i do n't know why he take the matter so personally ? finally ; never mind the yank ; lincolnpirate . he 's under 18 anyway so take his opinion for what it be worth . if your go job hunting ; use your big gun .

 i keep a painting of the missus over the front door.. keeps hawker away..
 of course you can hang up what you like in your home . the person that say that to you ; must have misunderstood it . what he/she mean be ; it 's not allow for a believing muslim to have painting of living creature ; that be forbid for the muslims . but most muslims do n't even know that .
 what 's the deal with painting ? we be move to doha in the new year . someone mention you be not 'allowed ' to have picture of live thing in your home . is this right ? do i leave painting of living thing ( even animal ? ) at home ? what can i expect ?
 i believe that in the strictest term muslims should not display image of anything that have a pulse .
 britexpet ... . maybe your right and i 'm wrong ; but the muslims i know ; have no knowledge of this ; or do n't understand the seriousness of the matter wa allahu alim .
 mmmm ... i think yes ; you can not have picture of animal ; except the bird in the qatari note ; the orix that be everywhere ( for instance in the logo of qatar airways ) ; the falcon picture ... war look for peace ; be like fornication look for virginity .
 what about the photo in the passport ?

 try call eurodollar rent a car.. they provide car rental with driver 4321313 look for edith . she expect ur call
 my experience with eurodollar : i ask them about what happen if there be a minor scratch . they say that there be sometimes charge of 20/30 qr . a few week later ; the car need to come into service . the car have small scratch on front bumper . they make a big deal of it even though i be pretty sure it be there before i hire it . after service ; they do not mention it and i take it out for another month . next day they phone me say it would need to be charge at 450 qr ! i tell them that they be take the piss and ask to speak to the manager . a man phone later and insist i pay it claim i need thing like police report etc - when i refuse he tell me to return the car . i say no problem if you give me back my money for the month i have hire the car . i suggest he come into work and pick up the car . he do not come in and do not phone again . next day ; car have a problem and wo n't start ( it have lot of little problem due to poor servicing ) . they come out with new key but take much long than they say they would . the same guy finally turn up with another who look threateningly at me and they go straight to the scratch . i tell them my feeling that it be minor but he make a big deal about need to get the whole bumper re-sprayed and that anybody do the job for 100 qr ( a i think reasonable ) would not do a good job . he say that a i be such a pal he will reduce it to 350 qr and that he will pay the remain 100 qr . basically ; i have to agree to pay or there will be no new key . i take the car to the main dealer and they quote 100 qr ! ! ! ! i believe that it be not likely that the main dealer for this car model would be cheap or of a poor standard when it come to spray . i suggest you avoid eurodollar a they be try to squeeze money out of any opportunity ... even bad than the other car hire place i have try .

 why not just answer his question ? he want to know if there be any baptist church in qatar ..
 no but there be americans that could possibly be baptist ... ... .that go to church ... ..but probably not to a baptist church in doha ... ... .
 american church i need help to contact american or baptist churches in doha
 the anglican church of doha be where most `` english'speaking people go to in doha . their church building be still under construction in the abu hamour church complex.but their service take place in doha english speak school ( desk ) near markhiya round about . entry to the place be restrict and qatar police will be gaurding the gate always . so if you want to go you have to call the pastor and inform him so they will add your name to the list with the police . if you need the phone number just write back .
 there be no baptist church a such in doha . only a handful of christian community be allow to have recognize ; sponsor ; full-time clergy ; and the baptists be not one of them . the emir graciously grant land to the anglican church to lead the various independent protestant christian community in doha to contract a protestant center . most baptists and evangelical christians i know tend to go to the non-denominational christian community such a doha fellowship and grace fellowship . both have webpage . like the anglican church ( and much of qatar for the that matter ) service be conduct in english ; but a fair number of participant do not speak english a their first language . hope you find what you be look for .

 and for these folk ; i say thanks for your response . britexpat ; frenchieman and saptakalran

 depends whose car you want to drive
 international drive licence usually vaild for 12 month from date of issue ; and yes you can use it..i do for 3 month until my rp come through and i get my qatar licence ...
 international driver licence hi ; i be come on tourist visa ; while wait to get my residence permit . can i drive use an international driver licence and for how long ? ? ( i find some old info on this but want to get an updated picture ) ..thank you very uch .
 you should always have your normal licence with you too . an international licence be not a licence in the true sense of the word
 yes you can . go to traffic dept . and apply for a temporary license . until you get ur rp .
 you can drive on an international driving licence for 6 month in qatar . however ; as soon a you get your rp ; you have to apply for a qatari driving licence a drive on an international one then ; become illegal .
 slim chance .. try with relative / neighbour / colleague ..
 best be to have a reciprocal arrangement with any of your friend have pet .
 most of the vet have kennel . call and ask there .
 hi i can take care of your dog during your vacation ? what breed ? and how long you will be in vacation . contact me 33776459
 most place book up early but try www.ppkdoha.net
 25 of june he be 1.7 year old and he be very well behave
 the average kennel cost be 35 -45qr per day . however ; you need to book in december to get a place . doha vets have just open a new facility ; call them on 4367187 ; they may be able to help you ; the price will be less if you can find someone who be prepare to share the cage with their cat ( if and only if they get along well ) . also check with qaws ; they may have space but you really will be very lucky to pay less than the go rate ; competition for cage be strong at this time of year . there be a lady who will visit your house daily ; change the litter and feed but it be very sad to leave a lone cat for a month ; if you consider do this why not offer a home to one of qaws many cat look for a home ? then ; you can leave the cat know he will be happy and also give a home to a cat who really need it . jj
 where can i leave my persian cat in summer for not pay more than 300 riyal per month i have a male gray persian cat and im travel for two monthes and i need to leave it in any place if some one can pls take good care of him for take not more than 600 riyal per 2 month pls answer be u be interested pls call 4474065
 sorry - qaws do n't do board ! we 're a rescue shelter only . if you 're look for someone responsible and knowledgeable to care for your pet whilst you be away you will need to spend more then that . 2 month board in any of the catteries here in qatar would be a minimum of qr2 ; 400 . and it would probably cost more to have someone come to your house twice a day to care for him .
 your cat nutered .
 it be legal to use it ; but illegal to resell credit - i.e . agent . best to buy your credit online .
 you can very well use your debit card to buy credit ... or else you can find many reseller near national who give you scratch card

 thank you for your response . i very much appreciate it . i know what a reasonable salary in the uk/europe would be but unsure about here in qatar . what do you think a reasonable salary would be and package ? i look forward to hear from you . regard
 it be my impression that any security job in qatar will be extremely low-paying when compare to a uk salary . mandi
 comment make by mandilulur a any offer will be well below the salary for similar work in the uk . add to that the cost of housing and other benefit such a health care and it really become a no-brainer .
 well ; just let u know what be the minimum salary you expect and i 'll let you know whether you can get it here or not .
 what be the purpose of heaven ? what be the point ? what be in it for the one that get there ? let 's leave the purpose of hell for another thread . i invite you to ponder . you can quote scripture or sura 's etc if you want but you must expand upon them with your own thought .

 sumtimes minor accident u may not come to know ..get the car check by any good mechanic
 u can take the person along with you to trafic police to get the full accident history .
 depends on the owner of the car..if she/he report the accident/s i believe u can check it to the traffic dept..but some owner be not do that especially if it only a small accident..try ur luck and go to the traffic dept..
 how about those who claim a low mileage by tamper with the car fuse box ? in my sense if you 're not able to detect trace of an accident then it be probably not worth mention ... for best result buy a new car : )
 checking the history of the car how can one check the history of the car like maintenance ; accident or service history . in every advertisement of the car ; people use to write `` accident free '' ; but in most case ; car have at least one or two accident ; which be not easily detectable through car inspection company . share your opinion in this regard .
 sith lord - be it true that someone can lower the milage by tamper with the car fuse box ? ...
 we have just buy a pre-owned car . we be look for car and if we finalise we have get it check at german auto specialist center on salwa road . from there we have find out that many of the car have minor accident and have touch up do to them . german auto specialist center also do a full techinal computer checkup of the engine and check the condition of the engine ; cylinder ; car stability ; etc . their ph # be 468 7377 . they be open during ramadan after 7p.m .
 a good experienced mechanic or tinsmith can easily detect body damage even if it have be touch up professionally ; bring one for inspection
 as far a i know there be no terrestrial broadcast in qatar ; everyone use satellite point at arab sat and nile sat etc . so a digital terrestrial receiver attach to an aerial will not work . you can by a cheap satellite decoder from supermarket etc to receive free channel ; otherwise you need to subscribe with qtel for a package ; like osn etc . find detail on qtel website .
 `` a major new survey by arab advisors group reveal that terrestrial tv still have a solid audience base in qatar with 45.1 per cent of household state that they tune into it . '' http : //www.ameinfo.com/126396.html either you be misinform ; mwa1 ; or the internet be .

 there be a different route to retrieve each type of i.d . for the qatar i.d . you first have to report it miss with the capitol police station which i believe be by souq waqf . after 7 day you go back and they will give you a paper to go and get another i.d . for the driving license ; go to the traffic department that issue these ; pay 100 i think it be and you 'll get another one on the spot . just remember to take your passport and any other pertinent i.d . to each of these place so a not to make a wasted trip . this happen to me before ; wallet be steal out of my locked car !
 i just lose my wallet in a shopping center.. i just lose my wallet ; somebody steal it in my back pocket . is there any way i can retrieve all my id 's and license ? nevermind about the money.. all i care about be my id's.. : ( i really think those kind of people do n't exist here in doha.. : (
 congrats ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! just apply for new one ... 100 bucks..
 those kind of people ? ? those type of people be all over the world . especially here in doha . there be more thief here then most place around the world that have be .
 maybe your stalker take it.. lol
 block all credit cards at once . secondly ; you can ask for duplicate health card/driving licence from http : //portal.www.gov.qa/wps/portal/homear . while duplicate qid you can get it from souq waqif ; airport ; mesaimeer branch of moi service station . be careful next time a corruption and poverty be increase day by day in all part of the world
 do n't listen to da count ! doha be a great place ; it 's just that sometimes thing like this happen ! it 's people like him that probably steal your wallet . i be sure the police will be more than helpful to retrieve your valuable or at least assist you in gain new one . da count ; your people be know for steal thing ; so you should be more sympathetic to this person .

 its good to gift the gift certificate instead of gift itself.. so this way they can choose the gift they want ... . and no more unwanted ... : - )
 ... but then i be bold and say what i think ; which be more than can be say about many people around u . but i sure would confront the person . maybe you can enlighten u a to what the unwanted gift be so we can bid for it too and embarass the person who have hurt you ?

 ... i would be hurt if i be you . i have be give the most strange thing when i leave work in abu dhabi ; before come here . i have keep them ; ship them here to qatar and they be a mismatch on my shelf . but you know what ? they make this place unique and special ; because each thing bring back a memory of a special time and person . i would never gift something that have be give to me a i do not have the gut or moral to do that . but we be not all the same - and try to make money of an unwanted gift be sad and show what the person who it be gift to be really like . `` be who you be and say what you feel ; because those who mind do n't matter and those who matter do n't mind ''
 sonaam ; you could then give it back to malrat who could then give it again to the ungateful and original recipient ; it could then go round in a circle until we all get dizzy . do you ever get present that you be sure the giver receive themselves a a present - i 'm sure there be lonely object like that float round the world destine to be unwrapped and wrap again and again ... now here 's your part of the deal ; cuz . lay the secret on me of man 's red fire .
 there be like that ; ; do anything for a buck ; ; even sell there ols grandmother teeth from the grave ; rules be a guideline for intelligent people ; but they must be adhere to by idiot .
 its hurts ; but you just give as a gift ? so dont mind dear . ( be this one you be talk about ) it 's an unwanted gift to me a i already have e71 and w705 for myself so if any1 interest ... .can let me know their offer through an sms ... on ? ? ? ? ? ? ? and if it a good offer we can set up the deal n this lovely mobile be all yours ! ! the mobile be black in colour and not even open the box ... .for more detail follow the link below `` http : //www.gsmarena ... . `` p.s : interested people can sms me their offers ... .i dont want profit on it ... so i can give it to u less than the market price ! ! thanks

 unwanted gift . what would you do if you find out that the gift that you have give to someone be put on sale at the classify with a label `` unwanted gift '' ? .
 you give them the gift because you care about them and want to make them happy . the gift should not be a burden on them and sit unwanted and take up space . what be the harm if they sell it and buy something they really need or want ? in a way it be still from you and they be happy a well .
 ill do nothing ; a i give it from my heart . appreciate or not ; it doesnt matter

 what time be the last show ?
 yes showtime do not have it . it be award to abu dhabi sport channel but i do not know who will broadcast in qatar
 thanks guy . is abu dhabi sport channel go to be show for free ? will it come with showtime or mosaic ?
 no i do n't think it will be show for free ; i think you should call qtel and ask them whether they be show on mozaic tv .
 any idea if the ad sport smart card be available yet in qatar ; or when they 'll be available ? less than three week to go till the new season !
 premiership footie channel i hear a rumour that showtime don ; t have the right next season to show premirship footie . is this right ? if so which channel a the right now ? also be it still al jazeera who have the right for the champion league ? i ; m on showtime package now butthinking of switch to mosaic esp if showtime don ; t have the premiership .
 yes time be run out for the new season ; i be guess we could watch ad sports on satellite ; but i will have to find out the frequency .
 i have some good news ! qtel 's mozaic tv+ will show the premier league in an agreement with abu dhabi media company.i think for the rest of u we have to wait for the ad sports smart card to be available . i have see this news in today 's the peninsula newspaper but i just ca n't post the link here .
 not look good for satellite viewer ... .check the retailer list on the right hand side ... no contact in qatar . http : //www.admcsport.com/en/satellite.php
 espn star sports : )
 so do this mean that we can not get it at all through showtime and we must replace this with mozaic ? ?

 no more visit visa ? can someone confirm if this be true ? a friend of mine just tell me that they be no longer issue visit visa to anyone . two people have already mention to me that they dont issue it anymore at the airport office . what about the immigration office ? have they stop it there too ?
 depends on the nationality of the subject . there be some nationality which be `` frowned upon '' by the qatari government ( due to political reason ) . jordanians ; iraqis ; palestinians ( from abroad ) and indians too a they always try to regulate the ratio of nationality in the country .
 cumbersome this rule be actually pass just a couple of day ago so it seem . i 'm talk about visit visa be stop completely for everyone ; not any specific nationality . both person that tell me this go to the airport branch . so it possible that they be no long issue visit visa there . but it still available at the immigration office in gharaffa ? good fortune always come knock at your door ... when you be sh*tting in the toilet ! ! : )  [ ] ~ < strong > smoke < /strong > ~ [ ]  < img src= '' http : //www.skamu.com/icons/animated/images/icon41.gif ''

 somebody hit my car / will i get insurance ? hi everybody ; somebody hit my car ; the back side bumper be damage ; so i tell police and they ask to come later . will insurance pay my loss ? i have a third party insurance . thanks in advance !
 no . you have to pay for the repair after you get the police report since your insurance be t.p.l . only
 well i dnt think so..
 if you the culprit you can get from his insurance if not then you have to cough up the cost yourself..
 if you dont know who hit you ; then you be responsible to go to police dept . to make a report for the damage and you 'll pay 110 . they will check also if you have any violation ( if you have ; sadly you have to pay it or else you 're not gon na get the report ) . since it only tpl ; sadly ( again ) you will bear the expense for the repair .
 cheerios be a cereal name brand . i 'd check mega mart . there be many western product in stock there . prepare to pay out the wazoo for them though !
 i saw them on sunday in megamart
 there be also some at shoprite . motherhood ... the hard job you 'll ever love ! : )
 the honey nut cheerios almost always seem to be in stock at megamart - at least when i go . the regular cheerios be more difficult to find ; but they do exist . ( buy them up when you can find them ! ) keep in mind that the honey nut cheerios have a lot of sugar ( 9g per serve ) compare to the regular cheerios ( 1g per serve ) http : //www.webmd.com/food-recipes/news/20081001/kids-cereals-some-are-50-percent-sugar they 're not as bad a some other cereal that target kid ; but they 're still quite sweet .
 thank you all for the input ... i hope i 'll get to find those regular cheerio
 so funny that you ask because i 've be look for them for a while too . here 's my info : 1 . regular ; plain cheerio : i 've only find them at megamart . and they cost like 23 riyal for a very small box ! 2 . honey cheerios ( from nestle ) : these be available at just about every grocery store like family food centre ; food palace ; lulu ; carrefour . they only cost around 13 riyal for a box . hope this help .
 cheerio ? ? ? can you find cheerio in doha ? ? ?
 i be go to write the same thing a ny couple . in family food centre you can occassionally get vanilla cheerio which do well on the taste bud but be a bit on the expensive side - like 35 riyal .
 oh and do n't buy into that wholegrain healthy crap that all these cereal advertise . they 're all still pretty heavily process . best healthy thing to do for breakfast be eat as much protein a you can - hence egg be highly recommend .
 cheerios be process - absolutely . however ; on an overall basis they 're much healthy than most of the other garbage out there that be market to mum for their baby & toddler . the sugar content of plain ol ' cheerios be also far low than that of sugared cereal and other snack ; which be generally even more processed than cheerios . some of the sugared cereal be up to 50 % sugar ( by weight - and more than that a a % of calorie ) . even some of the yogurt have more gram of sugar per serve than a full-sized can of coke ; thanks to all the added sugar ( and high fructose corn syrup ) . plain unsweetened/unflavored yogurt do contain natural sugar ; a do fruit ; but nowhere near the sugar level of the typical `` fruit '' yogurt here in qatar . nothing be ever truly perfect in the snack food world ; but we can strive for `` the best we can find '' . . .i just try to read the label and use common sense : o )
 do n't get me wrong doody . i myself have honey cheerio at home which i on occasion eat cause they 're quite tasty . what i mean to say ; though it do n't come across properly ; be that the advertising campaign that nestle cheerio have be over exaggerated . companies like nestle tend to amplify what little nutritional value their product have to convince consumer to buy them . like expat sueno say ; they be a bit healthy than the other stuff out there but at the same time they 're still not that healthy . anyway i do n't mean to be a diet nazi ; you should eat what you wish : ) oh and i have to agree with doratheexplorer ; i 'm not sure about give cheerio to a baby you 'd have to check up on that .
 if the body be crack ; you wont get the accoustic effect . i have one which i break by accident and then the sound quality dropped..

 yes you can leave ; as long a you dont have a loan ( money ) from a bank . your car will be just tow sometimes . it be not a big problem
 agree with mr . smfaham be try to get some information here and u should respond only if you hv any information on the topic . this be not facebook where your irrelevant n funny reply r go to get like from people . smfaham i would suggest you check with your company pro ; he/she may be able to guide you with the exact procedure if any .
 yes even i think that u should check with the traffic department a it will be good if u clear ur debt prior ur departure or else they will make issue at the immigration
 you may leave your property here as long a you have no financial obligations/debts for acquire that property . if you have doubt ; you may ask the staff work in traffic department . move on ! !

 termination from company hi ; please advice me ; my company terminate me ; then they be ready to give noc if i get new job . the problem be i have a car loan and credit card payment ; ; what be the procedure ? i be search for new job..any problem to change sponsorship ? please help me to give right answers.. thanks and best regard
 lesson : live with what u have and do n't take loan if it 's not for emergency reason coz a expat ; u can never be sure of ur status here in qatar . all u can do now be to look for another job but if ur not lucky to find one ( hope not ) then u 'll be in big trouble !
 the only problem you will have be you ca n't get your final exit from qatar until you get an noc from the bank to say that you have pay back your loan . if you ca n't get a new job you might have to borrow money from family back home to pay back the loan here ; otherwise thing can get difficult .
 friend you must be lucky a they decide to give you noc to join some other company ; ; ; if they refuse to give noc and decide to deport then what u do ? ; ; othewise ... ? ? ? ... all the best to find job and secure urself ...
 thank you very much for you advices.. actualy it car loan ; ; if i sell my car it easy to pay back loan.am hardely search new job ; if i change the sponsership should i need to pay back all loan ? let me know
 `` you change sponsorship you still have to pay car loan ? '' a loan be a loan no matter what and it have to be repay in full . now if it 's a company loan for car then for sure they 'll take it from your end of service payment ( or as much a they can ) . if it 's a bank loan then notify the bank immediately that you have be terminate and let them know you be actively search for a new job in order to be able to repay the debt . best of luck ! !
 nothing fatal ! find another job and keep pay your loan ; what 's the problem ? loan and credit card have nothing to do with your sponsorship . unless your company cancel your rp ... then your current company must inform your bank ; and they will simply freeze your account until you find another job . nothing extraordinary . if you want to leave for good ; you will have to pay off your loan . then sell your car and close the outstanding balance ; that 's it .

 wan na cheap ; go to najma . then you have to arrange the transport ; which avaliable arround you there . i 'm not talk about quality over there .
 both be the same standard . decent quality and decent price ( on sale ) . try out this new furniture shop in this new mall come up adjacent to la cigale hotel - al saad.this mall have benetton ; bhs etc . on the first level be this furniture shop - it have great look furniture ( the one ; id design standard but with home center price ) . i have already furnish my place but this be one recommended buy . does n't have too much of choice though but since it be a one off shop there be high chance of you do end up have the same furniture a your neighbour ( which be a high probabiliy with home center/homes r u )
 i think they both be have the same quality ... mostly chinese or veitnamees ... it depnd on the material .. if it be solid wood or rubber wood then it be diffirent from mdf and so on ... now u have a chance to buy from home cemter because they have special offer ... buy 250 and get 50 . accord to ur budget u will be able to move . i personally prefer home center which i furnish my house here and back home from it . they have more branch and more option to choose . good luck

 what you need be your passport copy and residence visa copy . the passport copy of the person you 're sponsor . to be 100 % sure call the embassy 44831-585 and 44836-871 .
 i already call there sir . unfortunately they do n't give me the requirement because they say that it be only for family visit visa.i need it for business visa of my cousin.do you think they will entertain me ? thanks so much .
 i see . you 're in a different situation . you do n't need an affidavit of support since your cousin will be on a business visa . what you need be an assurance letter from the company or person that grant the visa regard the stay of your cousin here in doha .
 pe will not issue u affidavit of support . they will only issue the say document to those who be give visit visa under your sponsorship . they will also ask for a copy of moi visa printout .
 i have nephew come here under buseness visit visa ; he produce only letter from his relative prove that he have relative in doha ; with relative passport copy ; visa copy id copy and relatives employment contract.and ; with another file be the sponsor letter ; visa application ; print visa from the moi website.that all.at his first check-in deny and off-loaded and go home hopeless.we rebooked and finally board the plane without any problem or interview .
 actually sir i be ask for a family visit visa for my cousin . they say that there be no available family visa right now thats why they just give me a business visa for her.so do you think they will authenticate the letter from my company and the immigration oficer will accept this one ? thans sir alexam .
 @ lizkat . family visit visa be only applicable to immediate family member such a husband ; child ; parent and sibling . your cousin be not your immediate relative . so you can not apply for a family visit visa for her/him .
 so it mean that even if my sister will have the same business visa they will still refuse to give me an affidavit of support . thats so sad . i just want them to be with me for a week or two so we could be together .
 no must be have qater drive license by go to trafic offec to change his worled licens
 can i drive my friend car my father and mother be come to qatar for 4 week holiday . if my father have an international driving license can he drive my car legally with no problem with the police if there be an accident .
 he can not drive unless he get a valid qatar drive license ;
 yes he can this be the reason to get intenational liciens
 as far a i know yeah .. if someone be on visit visa he/she can drive car on international lic ... if get resident permit then u should get qatar drive lic . otherwise theres no point of get international drive lic .
 yes he can drive . and i think there be a time limit for that .
 hi charlie ; first you must edit your question ; you ask can i drive my friend car ; later you say your father be come ; yes if your father have international driving licence he can drive ; but make sure about local traffic rule to avoid heavy fine .
 for 7 day
 if your father can drive he can drive your car . the question be if he may drive your car . that depend on the owner . if you want to know if he 's allow to drive the car ; the traffic rule apply .
 what if someone ( a friend or family with valid drive license ) drive my car with my acknowledgement then have an accident . how would the police or insurance company act in this matter ? cheers sk
 yes ; tht im sure he can drive for 7 day ;
 for a hundred thousand you could get an xterra ... amaze off roader with 4l engine and 250 bhp at your disposal ... but it be a 5 seater ... 6 seaters start at 126000 ... the prado 2.7l ... i be not sure of the american and korean brand though ... but i think the ford edge be pretty cool ... so be the gmc acadia ...
 what be a good 4wd with 6/7 seat ? ideally look at budget of around qr100 ; 000 ; and should be good for off road . any idea ?
 go for the gmc envoy xl . its too good and maint wont cost you much .
 nissan patrol standard start from 126 ; 000 4.8ltr . v6 excellent power .
 thanks . a few people have mention the dodge durango . brand new it 103 ; 000 i think for the base model . i have see a few hummer h2 's for around 100 ; 000 for a 2004 model . would this be an alternative ?
 dont know why that answer have come up here !
 i think the best 4wd be toyota land crusir
 hi ; go for toyota land cruiser ; great resale value ; and space as well . if your budget be less then go for chevy tahoe or youkon . both be look good ; powerful engine and space also .
 the best off - roader ; 7 seater to my knowledge be toyota land cruiser ! ! no doubt . ultimate power for sand dune ride and climb silently . even have the best resale value !
 you can go for kia mohave it be 7 seat + within your budget basic price be qr97 ; 000 . high performance engin 280 bhp ; 4x4 drive very good in dune .

 tatsky signal let me know from the user of 'tatasky receiver ' ; whether they face any problem with the signal quality during the day time . now-a-days ; in the day time the signal be so weak for the tatasky receiver . do you all face the same problem or the signal be good for you in day time ? if the signal be good ; please suggest a technician for me . regards/rk
 raniskkt ; friends call me idiot for have an e-pehla ( uae ) connection which they say be very expensive ( i agree indeed ! ) but for me itz very reliable a i cant miss news and sport on any day . ''the secret of get ahead be get start ''
 ranisht he ask for solution not which channel can be watch during day and night time ... ..nor be he intrested in move to hilal to see tatasky . aana free ; jaana free ; pakde gaye tho khana free .
 most of the reply be so funny . when the guy be ask a simple question answer with relevance . no pal tata sky do not work so well during the day due to solar disturbance . dont listen to the qtel 's self proclaim spokesman who speak only crap . nothing will happen if you use tata sky . i dont find it illegal at all since it do not air porn channel but pure family entertainment . secondly it be register and pay for service . there should be no harm use it as long a you dont bother qtel . qtel should not be bother a they provide useless tv channel in doha ; unlike in dubai pehla network be face loss due to customer switchover . if it be illegal ; then please talk with fact where in qatar qtel pull out the dish antenna for tata sky . no one care . dream box be still flood in the market and that should be something qtel should ban a it a portal for obscene channels..
 yeah easy easy ... agree signal be poor look like they cut down on their signal strength or else pehla or qtel be interupting the signal cause they r loose buisness . as you say call a technician be of no use . aana free ; jaana free ; pakde gaye tho khana free .
 yes.. signal be very poor in day time.. screen frozen for logn time . and yes.. tata sky do n't care about it . their motto.. jisne lagaya tata sky.. uski life ka kar do jhinga lala . if you want to watch dvd quality picture and sound.. good get a dvd player.. tata sky be useless . winner never quits and quitter never wins.. do it mean that only one person will win all the time ?
 check it out t in india they do n't give a dam to customer ... they be too busy do `` jhinga lala '' to their customer . winner never quits and quitter never wins.. do it mean that only one person will win all the time ?
 we have get a tata sky at home ... it do have dvd quality picture and cd quality sound throughout the day & night.. signals r well above the required level and the service never get interrupted ... our location be near al-arabi stadium ... the signal quality depend on the surroundings ... ours be a villa and there be no tower or high building which block the signals ... hence ; happy veiwing all the time ...
 lucky sadaf and jezmir ... .. btw be also stay in a villa and therez no top risen building in my area madhina khalifa ... so wut might b the issue ... hmmmm

 rizks ; it be a question not a statement . so answer if you know about it ... : - ) `` it be well to be hat for what you be than be love for what you be not . ''
 oh ok ; my bad ! i read it wrongly ! ! i think it cheaper in duty free but not much of a difference . < a title= '' everything you need to know about living in doha ; qatar '' href= '' http : //www.qatarliving.com '' > < img src= '' http : //static.qatarliving.com/badges/150x50 '' alt= '' everything you need to know about living in doha ; qatar '' / > < /a >
 no ; i 've not notice the price be cheap in duty free . it 's just more convenient ; almost same price and on your way out plus weight do not count to your allow limit .
 for alcohol/liquors yes it be cheaper in duty free . < em > '' how far you go in life depends on you be tender with the young ; compassionate with the age ; tolerant of the weak . someday you will have be all of these . `` < /em >
 i think the perfume be cheap too ; not sure on that one ; but at least they 're genuine ; - )
 yes it be
 perfumes and cosmetics be cheap in all the duty free shop compare to the local market price . it will be 15-20 % cheap through out the duty free shop in the world . food item and confectionary might not be cheap in many case . electronics be cheaper in the local market .
 last time i check electronics be price more than what they be in local hyper market and mall . alcohol be cheap and that 's all that matter : p good fortune always come knock at your door ... when you be sh*tting in the toilet ! ! : )  [ ] ~ < strong > < /strong > ~ [ ]  < img src= '' http : //www.skamu.com/icons/animated/images/icon41.gif ''
 yes electronics be expensive in duty free . ca n't compare alcohol price a no alcohol available in doha malls ; )
 doha airport v/s doha malls are the item inside doha airport ( duty free ) cheap compare to those that be sell inside the mall ?
 perfume and make ups be cheaper in duty free ... esp . liquor < b > '' bring it on chaka doll ! ! ! `` < /b >
 basically ; duty free be never any cheap than store out in the city . in doha ; the only exception be alcohol ... the price difference be however marginal : about 10 % vs. qdc .
 why would you buy alcohol from duty free in qatar ? i think alcohol would be cheap at the destination than qatar duty free .
 i just return from a trip to dubai ; and buy a perfume on the way out . it be 237qr duty free ; which be much good than the cheap price i could locate in the mall ; at 314qr ( some shop be ask up to 400qr for the same item ) .
 we live in abu dhabi for a few year and be fascinate by the fact that tourist bus from dubai arrive at abu dhabi co-op to buy good at cheap than dubai duty free price . dubai duty free be cheap at one time but not so now i suspect .
 unfortunately they aint cheap compare to mall . also watch to check on the warranty ; a they have funny system of warranty system if buy in duty free . so electronics not advisable in duty free ... but ; goodnews be that ; the alcohol be 50 % cheap in duty free compare to qdc : -d ... . lol.. enjoy and remember to drink responsibly ( dont spill it )
 chocolate be way more expensive in duty free than in store . cosmetic ; cheap in duty free . those item be the only one i check .
 oh.. not to forget the root beer.. ( those school days.. ) : -|
 yes it be cheaper in some parfums . and there be nice collection of toy and chocolate . but i 'm not sure about the price . but for me it be cheap ; good idea to buy some to your child to be quiet .
 god no . the very definition of duty free read 'premium ' and 'exclusive ' and hence the pricetag to justify .
 doha airport v/s doha malls are the item inside doha airport ( duty free ) cheap compare to those that be sell inside the mall ?
 i know for fact that the makeup is cheaper.. [ img : - ) |link=none|align=left|width=440|height=56 ]
 gold be cheaper in the duty free than in the gold souk ...
 gold be cheap in duty free than gold souk ? ? ? ? ? lol
 borloe ; have you try bargain ? it 's a tried and true method to get a good deal ; duty free doesnt offer that option
 its tax free in duty free ; like for ex liquor in qdc be 82qr ( 75cl ) in duty free be 45qr ( 1 ltr ) . perfumery ; confectionery and electronics be cheeper in dutyfree ...
 my fellow ql'ers ; a comparison can only be make between a real duty free & a mall ; qdf be an excuse ; '' real '' airport have duty free shop so in keep with that ; they 've throw together the basic booze ; chocolate ; cigarette ; which if you walk fast enough past the security check or blink hard ; you 'll miss altegether ; so really if we be to compare ; do it between say dubai or abu dhabi or bahrain duty free & the price in the hypermarkets/malls ...
 matet ... it offensive
 depends on what u be goin to buy ; last year i remember and purchase in qatar duty free be canon 1000d which i take for 599 $ ( 2 ; 190qr ) . in carrefour that time it price be 3 ; 499qr . not bad ! ! !
 career odjective . have 4years experience in qatar . have a valid qatar drive license languge skill . arabic ; english ; hindi and malayalam pc skill . ms office ; email internet call no.77022945
 definitely ; absolutely cheaper in qdf . buy your perfume and cosmetic there which be 30 % cheap than local market .
 doha airport v/s doha malls are the item inside doha airport ( duty free ) cheap compare to those that be sell inside the mall ?
 have the rule change that i be unaware of ? otherwise ; why would anyone be worry about alcohol price of duty free if youre still not allow to bring it into qatar ? i wouldnt buy alcohol on an outbound flight because you can certainly buy it cheap at your destination .

 lakers will advance to nba final ... but then again ; lebron and the rest of the cavalier will harvest their great season ... the only team in nba history to win their first 8 playoff game with a double digit margin ( at least 10 point ) ... respect
 the conference final wo n't be an easy journey for cleveland ; afterall they will have to play orlano after they defeat the celtic in game 7 at boston ! and with a 19 point deficit ! again ; first time in history boston would lose a game 7 playoff game ! ! ! sorry i mean first time the lose a home game 7 in the playoff respect
 nba western conference finals la lakers vs. denver nuggets which one do you think will advance to the nba finals ? i 'm sure this will be a very interesting series consider one fact that chauncey billups make a big impact on the nuggets line up .
 get ta beat the hell out of u
 lakers 2 nuggets 1 magic 2 cavs 1 too early to joke about ; but lebron-kobe final be become a myth lol
 agent ; i guess we 'll have to change the stats for today lakers 2 - denver 2 : ( these conference final really can change a lot in such a short notice ; but then again hehehehe lakers to the nba final !
 orlando 3 - cleveland 1
 denver 4-3 ; orlando 4-2
 lakers 4 denver 2 lakers wait at the final !
 lakers will make it to the final
 hahahaha.. i told you people ... it 's 4-2 lakers to finals ...

 if you drink in bar or pub they put a stamped in the hand . but have to be careful while drive go with a friend so anyone of u be more drunk the other can drive u safely u can go to the distellary in abbuhamor to buy drink but for that u need a license . drinking in open be ban here .
 bad boy ...
 take an noc and salary certificate from your sponsor ; pay a refundable deposit of qar 1000/- and get a liquor permit from qdc . enjoy ur drink at home.. nothing to worry at all ... just make sure that ; u r not on wheel when drunk..
 brother remove this post.if a muslim drink he will be behind bar .
 do not give yourself to the dark side . it will only lead to ruin . fight against it young jude !
 i might give the bar a miss and try reduce what i drink in door ; be there any gym i can join and do you know how much they cost
 consuming alcohol could anyone please advise me ; i have just be offer a position in a construction company in qatar and i be wonder if you can buy alcohol from shop and bar or be it restrict like in other middle eastern country .
 ianjude ; all the big hotel have gyms where you can get gym/pool membership . i think the rate start at about 6000qr per year ; i 'd suggest you have a look see ; sometimes they have special . there be also a large gym in city center ; but the parking be horror .
 do ask your company in advance i do know that there be a few company out there that be not willing to give a permit to expats
 `` what have muslim get to do with this thread '' 1 . alcohol be restrict because qatar be officially a muslim country . 2 . muslims be prohibit ( by law anyway ) from have a liquor or pork license and be not suppose to be serve at hotel bar . we all know ; of course ; that many people find their way around it . mods -- please take a note of this purposeful oversensitivity and baiting . to the op -- it 's easily obtainable ; but expensive .
 bachus ... good possibility that your and my comment will get this thread lock ... : p
 ya rite no merci all other r religious saint n they dont consume alcohol or touch bacon ; )
 you can have it in 5 star hotel or else get a liquior permit from qatar distribution company . those be your choice mate !
 babu ? eh ? i do n't care ; they can do what ever they want ... i just think ianjude need to know . that 's all . and not eat pork or drinking alcohol do not make anybody a saint imho . anyhow ... .let the nonsense begin ... . : p
 maybe i will just go the gym ; it be a simple question that seem to have touch a few nerve ; i do n't mean any offence be just ask for advice ; thanks anyway
 the thread wo n't get lock ; but your comment get remove without notice . except if you have a different user-name ; you 'd be safe .
 it ok u can change ur book and consume all u can even chicken or chicken biyani ; p
 consuming alcohol could anyone please advise me ; i have just be offer a position in a construction company in qatar and i be wonder if you can buy alcohol from shop and bar or be it restrict like in other middle eastern country .
 do n't know why some folk be hiss at the non-muslim bit..nomerci and others be right when they say it a muslim country with liquor restrictions..a muslim catch drunk driving be sure to be treat differently than a non muslim person..there 's no need to be so sensitive guys..i 'm muslim myself but do n't see what xena and then the others say that be wrong
 me and my muslim mat love a good drink ; in fact they drink more than me ! anyway i 've see qataris shopping at qdc in thobes but who care as long a they be share the joy liquid .
 ok. what next ?
 i be a british muslim come from uk soon inshallah ( god willing ) . even for myself i know i will have to adapt to the lifestyle in qatar . personally i think a long you follow the guideline you should be ok .
 @ ianjude64 as far a alcohol go ... .it be available at all the bar and night club in town plus u can purchase it for personal use at home by acquire a liscence ... .quite a simple process and ull be be give an id which allow to to purchase it . hope this answer ur question
 @ bauchus i agree with u that the reaction was overly sensetive ! but just to clarify ... muslims be not prohibit by law to from have alcohol although they use to be ... .now a day they r prohibit from acquire a license to purchase it for home use but they still can `` legally '' consume alcohol at any of the bar in town ; many of which require membership and none of which can legally reject any person for be a muslim i know that because what ur say `` use to be '' true and it be abolish about 3 yr ago and announce in all bar due to an insident that happen at irish bar at sheraton ... since then all muslims can drink legally if they choose to do so at any establishment
 thanks for the clarification super cool . it always strike me a impossible for hotel enquire about someone 's religion before serve a drink ; good to know they be n't expect to do it .
 just wonder if this guy would also need his company letter or noc to join the gym or to go and play pool with the girl by the sea
 you make me laugh thanks for make my day ; ) i think it do help to drink a bit before drive in doha ; .makes you more aware ; ) ; .and your skill while be deluted with alcohol will be equal or still good then the other driver surround your with there big suv 's
 i can understand the dutchman ; the english ; the german or even the american ragging on qatar 's street ... .but the dude from `` thailand '' ! ! ! no offence bro have u ever be outside in bangkok or phuket ? ? ? ? hehehe we have 2 type of driver in the qatar.the formula one drivers.and the super extra accentuate gravely careful ; lol . the funny part be that the super crazy doesnt stick to the fast lane where they belong and weave in and out of traffic.and the super careful practically live on the fast lane and wouldnt budge for the life of me : -d
 consuming alcohol could anyone please advise me ; i have just be offer a position in a construction company in qatar and i be wonder if you can buy alcohol from shop and bar or be it restrict like in other middle eastern country .
 haha that be funnily true..the careful in the f1 lane and the racer in all lanes..although one could say that the racer be make homeless by the careful folk : - )
 splash ; in city center and al asmakh mall ( near al saad ) regards ! !

 my guess would be no a you need to show your qatar id to get one
 call qdc tel : 44699413
 yes ; you can get the liquor license if you hold a valid rp in qatar . you just need a letter from your sponsor state your designation with your salary ( all allowances must be included ) ; copy of rp from your passport ; qr.1000/- ( one time deposit ) .. go to qdc ; fill up the form ; submit all the above . if approve ; you will be grant the permit in 15min .
 i dont think so brother
 of course assume you be a muslim ; i think you have no chance of get a liquor license . not sure about qatar ; but i know of a friend of mine that have an australian passport ; but he be a muslim ; and they refuse a license to him in the uae . i would think unless you can provide proof to the authority that you be not muslim ; then you will have no success . of course ; i could be wrong ; but i doubt it in this case .
 be u out of ur mind ? ? dont u have a littel dignity or shame ? ? be this the image u want to give about muslim ? if u a muslim dont follow ur religion and stick to it how do u expext others to respect u and respect ur religion and convince them about it ? ? ? ? sooooo shock and ur from emirate ? ? ? ? waw what do ur parent think ? ? ?
 please .

 thanks mate your help be highly appreciated
 hey guy he may be talk about an automatic rifle !
 automatic licence for men ? since when do they require a licence ; btw ; the last i look all of it be `` manual '' !
 i think only those who have high profession ( doctor ; lawyer ; etc.. ) can get automatic license . other than that ; you will drive manual gear for the drive test .
 tell ne ... who be you go to kill ?
 i think ; approach to drive depends on the person sit behind the wheel . not only profession ; his age ; gender ; background ; mental condition ; intelligence ; emotional iq ; reflex even his mood influence his/her drive . how many time have you make a general idea of the person in the driving seat who zip past you wrong side without look at him/her .
 men who drive automatic be nancy boy in my opinion ... might a well buy a triumph spitfire ir tiida a your first car ..
 ***oops ; double post***

 you should be quite suspicious if the school do not provide you with the information you require . what kind of professionalism be that ? are you sure you want to deal with bloody amateur ?
 lp exactly..
 the best thing to do be to contact them directly ( hr ) to find out the detail . if they be not give you any information ; then ... it give you an idea about the culture of place you 'll be work for ...
 the word use be `` moving-out '' .
 well the offer of employment include information on sallary and allowance as well a the extra offer and info on what i be require to provide in term of documentation . i know how much i will be pay ; the date cover by my contract and all of that ; i be just wait for specific on accommodation etc ... i know there be other people move out at the same time so be hop at least one of them might use this website and might have receive some of that information . i know that i should not expect thing in qatar to be a efficient or transparent a in the uk but i have experience of work in other country where that be also the case so like i say ; i be give the school the benefit of the doubt ...
 most school would tell you what type of accomodation they provide at least - for example single/one bedroom fully furnish flat . also ; if they be an ongoing operation ; they probably already have the flat rent and should be able to provide more particular ( i.e . photo ) . as for get pay ; no matter the status of your residency ; they should be pay you while it go through the bureaucracy ; reputable employer do that . if for some reason you do n't get an rp then they should also tell you what happen at that stage ( repatriation at the school 's expense ) .

 lulucentre ... ... soooper collection ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
 and why be you ask ?
 anything relate to mutton or beaf in qatar be halaal .
 this be one good article i find on net . is halal meat halal ? the title of this article be a bit misleading . i do eat halal meat but only that which i have either slaughter myself or from someone i know ; trust and be confident can slaughter an animal properly . this may come across a a rather elitist viewpoint but it be only that - my viewpoint which i admit be more personal that strictly religious . in my early year of islam meat be just that ; meat . i ; like everyone else ; simply look for the halal logo on a packet of meat ; the shop window or restaurant . i consume a reasonable amount of meat per week . however thing start to change . on one hand i start to realise that the phrase `` you be what you eat '' be literally true . i notice a huge difference in my health ; outlook and religious state after period of be vegetarian . on the other hand i start to question whether halal meat be actually halal . i wonder whether we could actually trust the butcher ; the producer or even the slaughter man in the abattoir . i also question whether the intensive exploitation of animal rest comfortably with my understanding of islam . i conclude that there be too much doubt involve and decide to follow the advice of the prophet ( peace be upon him and his noble family ) to leave that over which i have doubt . at one point my family have pretty much turn vegetarian . meat rarely enter our house and the only time we eat meat be at friend ' house . although vegetarianism be to be applaud and even encourage ; i do believe that some meat be healthy . all the prophets ate meat with the grandfather of them all ibrahim ( peace be upon him ) offer the sacrifice we still commemorate every year at the end of hajj . upon move to the countryside our ambition to produce ; slaughter and eat our own meat finally come true . we use to buy lamb from farmer ; i would slaughter them and have someone butcher it ready for the freezer . we even start to breed our own chicken . the meat be fantastic ; not only do it taste different but it look and felt different . the texture and colour of real meat ! one of the benefit of living in the countryside be that you meet people that work in agriculture ; these be the people that bring u our vegetable and meat . through speaking to them i start to find out some thing about both animal farming and suppose halal meat . animals be exploit . if one see the condition they be bear ; breed and die in it would horrify anyone with a good heart . chickens lead miserable life in huge shed ; share their space and air with thousand of others . they do nothing but feed and get fat as fast a possible ready to make their way to supermarket sell them a `` value '' meat or to a chicken cottage on the high street . larger animal face similar problem . lambs be pump full of steroid to make sure they do n't die ; ewe with hormone so they give birth out of season and both fee on grass treat with insecticide . cattle be sometimes born and breed in shed ; they never see daylight or eat a blade of grass . muslims need to ask whether this be something they be truly happy eating . is it good to eat meat that be full of rubbish ; that lead a miserable life and a stressful end ? is it not possible that all this transfer into the meat ? one also need to ask if this method of farm sits with the ethos and spirit of islam . does islam not teach compassion ; kindness and do it not fight exploitation ? to me both these element make most of the meat in the uk inedible . i do not want to subject my body to such produce and i definitely do not want to contribute towards an industry that exploit a community that praise allah ( quran 13:15 ; 17:44 and 22:18 ) . through an increase interest in the whole area of meat ; animal welfare and organic food i want to see whether local abattoir would be open to me come in and slaughter animal . my talk and visit to some local abattoir confirm all my previous suspicion about halal meat in the uk . the first abattoir i ever call tell me that there be no problem in come and do halal meat a they already have someone who do that . upon question the abattoir it turn out that he man who do that be muslim but do not slaughter them himself but process them normally ; mean they be kill by non-muslims . `` he read a prayer on them or something then give them to u ; '' be the exact word . another local abattoir inform me that `` all we do be halal meat '' . again after some probing i find out that none of the slaughter men be muslim . the abattoir have actually enter into a deal with a muslim who be process them in this tuck away abattoir and sell the meat a halal . as you can imagine i be shock . so a you can see ; there be some people out there that do not seem to have a conscience . they be pump out thousand of carcass of haram meat to butcher and restaurant and you be eat it . however ; my problem with halal meat do not stop there . i also question the hygiene standard of a lot of muslim own abattoir . the vet at my abattoir once say to me that he have see place in birmingham that be `` cover in shit '' . `` how can you call that halal ? '' he ask me . my other issue be with the slaughter men . as someone who visit an abattoir every week and do between 10-30 lamb i know your mind drift . it make me question whether those that work a slaughter men full -time really remember to say `` bismillah - allahu akbar '' or even pay attention to what they be do . this be not their fault but a consequence of the high demand for meat and the need to process so many animal per day . as a result of all this thinking ; research and experience i have make an oath not to eat halal meat ever again unless i know exactly where it have come from . i be not advocate that everyone do this a i appreciate this be not always possible ; but to anyone who have take the time to read this i would ask you to really question your relationship to meat . the companions ( may allah be please with them ) be know to have make themselves sick upon discover that the source of some food be doubtful . a lot of my conclusion be purely personal . i wish modern day sheikhs and scholar would address the issue of intensive farming ; animal right and what we eat . this whole area be sadly lacking and need to be examine in order to give u some guideline . at the end of the day those that simply want meat can put their trust in a logo . it be those that want something well ; for themselves ; their child and animal ; that need to start think about the meat they eat and take some tough decision . by muhammad ridha payne thanks .

 tinker correction half brother/sister : where there be one common biological father/mother eg : man have child from first wife marries again and have second child = half sibling sept brother/sister : where the child be from another parent . eg : man marry a woman who already have a child from the previous husband
 jentizon - pls chk the link ive give . they will give you a fair idea and also have your sister check with her pro guy . since you be now married you may be able to get only a tourist visa but do check with the pro just in case .
 if the last name be the same then there 's no issue in apply for family visit visa . immigration do not have dna test for issue visa .

 why you dont ask our embassy ... but be patient there ... . goodluck !
 try ur luck in our embassy maybe it more difficult processing for notarization other than to have an exam in us..lol '' ) best of luck
 i believe what you need be the authentication of your document . the document you need to be authenticate should have the red ribbon from dfa manila . if not then the embassy here will ask you to send it to dfa manila first before they will authenticate it . you can do it at the philippine embassy and then after you go to qatar ministry of foreign affairs .
 hi rey ... ; bring all your document to your embassy here in qatar ... they can notarize it ... but you have to pay it of course.. i think this cost around hundred riyal per document ...
 by the way rey ; if you mean `` authentication '' or `` rid ribbon '' ; you must first send back your document to your country -philippines and ask your relative to stand a your representative to process the authentication in dfa manila ... there be a reminder flash in tfc from phil . embassy doha that any document you want them stamp it or authenticate it..you must first get authenticate it from the philippine ( dfa manila ) ... good luck ...
 notarization of the document can be do at the doha philippine embassy . but for the authentication.make sure that all your doc have be authenticate ? red ribbon at the dfa manila else doha pe wo n't have it authenticate .
 hi all po . relative to the topic ; may i a what be the various document that need to be `` authenticate '' or `` red ribbon '' in dfa manila ? if ; for example ; i be to work in qatar ; all document ask by my employer should be bear the red ribbon ? ( i.e . prc certificate ; nbi ; etc . ) tama po ba ? thanks so much .
 double post
 me ! : (
 slow internet from even be there any other who be face slow internet speed from even onwards ... and if any know why it be happen pls share ... .
 aaaaaargh it drive me nuts ! it there ; it not there ; it slow a sin ; what be q-tel playing at ! ?
 me too ... slow ... and comming and not comming
 is there any solution by share this problem ...
 yes my internet also slow.why it happening
 go to your respective country 's mofa or embassy in qatar . you always need to ratify your document from ministry of foreign affair of your country or embassy in foreign country ... ..
 if this be to do with her labour card then welcome to labour card nightmare ! . i be assume you be indian . in this case all her academic certificate ( not diplomas from pvt institution ) must be send to india for attestation from the foreign affairs ministry there . once it be back attest at indian embassy . then go to mofa and attest all over again . and all this should be do on the original certifiacte and not copy . you can contact asia translation or urogulf and they will charge qrs . 500 per certificate . you will get it from india in 15 day ; .
 you need to get a letter from your employer or a utility bill . then take to your embassy and ask exactly how you do it . for british ; we have to send the certicates to a registered solicitor in the uk who stamp them ; send to uk ministry of foreign affairs ; then onto qatar embassy in london who stamp them . once back they can be present to ceid .
 just you go traffic department and show them your original dubai drive license they will give you new qatar license immediatlly .
 life could never be so easy ; follow abdu 's advice above ... .
 first acquire a letter from your sponsor of no objection then proceed to traffic division for type then you will have and eye test.. and that 's it you will get a qatar license
 dubai drive license i be hold a dubai driving license ; please advise on the step to attain a qatar drive license base on my current dubai license .
 follow the chiefmate 's advice - in addition ask the officer to return back your uae drive licence . in some case they be not return . if he do not return you argue with him & take it back . uae licence be most difficult & they do not transfer same qatar do for other gcc licance - i think
 you need to appear only from the test you fail and do not have to repeat the passed one . try to get a new date ; it may take quite a while i.e . around a month . good luck
 you will do the failed test ... good luck
 u will only take the test which u have fail ; those u have pass will not be repeat ; have the driving school ask u to take some more learning lesson for the road test ; best be u practice with the driving instructor for some more hour ; best of luck
 yes u only have to do road test ; no need to repeat from start . second thing they fail u sometimes just becoz they r allow to pass specific quota . they cant pas evryone . they order to pass specific number of people . and second everybody be write that pay some thing to instructor . no need to pay anything to instructor . simply pay 1500 riyal and get rid of test . thats it
 surely he will pay ; if his visa be on the table . have a nice day
 most probably it a yes . i be not sure . but you can check at the immigration office near the airport or any immigration office to avoid last minute trouble .
 yes he will pay
 not sure..its no heard from someone ... bcoz thy fine only after 24 hour of visa expiry
 hai.. of cause he have to pay fine for the extra three day ; it come qr600/- see you only tell that visa be for only 1month ; which mean only for 30 day . he have enter qatar on 5th of january 2009 ; then 30 day completes on midnight of 3rd feb. 2009 . natuarlly he have to pay fine for three day . better to avoid fine tell your friend to preponed the ticket on 3rd of feb2009 . otherwise his father can enjoy the visit and pay the fine for extra 3 day . hope it help you
 can i open a bank account ? i be wonder if i can open a bank account a i be on visit visa .
 to open an account you must have rp .
 what do rp stand for ?
 rp stand for `` residence permit '' ; you must have an rp in form of an id ( also call pataqa ) in order to transact business here ( even in buy sim card )
 and why in the world you want to open a bank account here if you be only on visit visa ? ? ? ? on what purpose ?
 yes you can ; but will be a deposit account . but some bank request a letter from the company you be work for to transfer your salary . in case you be not work ; some bank accept and some not .
 mostly no . you can check the bank directly .
 no `` u cant '' open a bank account on avisit visa and if u be on work visa u need a pay of min qr-5000 and a guarantee letter from the company ...
 thanks to qnb ... . yeah i also think that it will be very hard and maybe impossible ... but yesterday i go to qnb and open one and it just take 5 min anyways thank you everyone for the reply and have a great weekend .
 halo mskhan ; i would also like to open account with a visit visa for my brother.. just want to ask what be the requirement in open an account with qnb with visit visa only.. thanks for this thread..

 where could i buy cute puppy ? ? i 'd like to buy puppy for a pet . but i do not know where to get one..if anyone do ; please tell me the shop ; place or the address..thanx .

 hi there . i have two small dog and they be saluki/greyhound type . they be now 6 month old . just let me know if you be interested . no money involve . it free to good home . thanks .
 all puppy be cute - go to qaws and if you meet the requirement you will most likely find a companion to love you for life . however ; if you do n't meet the requirement - reexamine carefully your desire to get a dog . they be not a toy ; they can live up to 15/16 year of age and they require good care .
 pet shop sure ; go ahead to the pet shop at al nasr street . buy a cute puppy . just be inform that all pet shop in doha be very unhygenic and have low ( if any ) standard . the animal be usually diseased and sick . my neighbor buy a kitten for christmas at this very shop . it die the next day . she have to threaten them with a call to the police in order to get a refund . qaws be your best bet a they have train vet to help them look over the animal in their care . go there and get educate about pet ownership .
 have you the course at vcu ?
 sorry joe90 do nt get u : (

 qatar be indeed one of the fast develop country in the world . we be not live a primitive life here . however drink fuel be far cheap than mineral water . jokes apart ; you get all kind of mineral water in qatar and that too from all part of the world . i be sure there be a brand of mineral water of jordan a well ; coz i have see and buy lebanese brand as well . the water be really tasty . anyway the tap water be very safe to drink in qatar ; as long a you filter it . water be be treat with best and late technology here . so you need not worry . in any case you have great quality mineral water here for you to enjoy and drink ! cheers
 living expenses and drinking water in qatar i recently be offer a job in doha..i find here some useful insight about rental rate . what be the other high and costly expense ? i be also wonder about drinking water ! do people usually drink from tap or bottled water in qatar ? since tap water get me sick once in my city ! !
 its a nice & cool place to live . irrespective of what water you prefer to drink ; it safe and heatlthy.you can even buy water by pay 7-8riyals per 20liter or can even use tap water . qatar be a very nice and clean country a it a small unlike our country due to 100 crore of population it very difficult for our governament to stop pollution/corruption/or dieseases spread due to uncleanlines ... ... ..something magically need to happen to change our country 's infrastructure . but still i be proud to be an indian and i love qatar as well .
 bottled water be pretty cheap and lot of place sell large jug for water cooler . there be very little to do here and there be a caste system between the different race ; so luxary item aim at the favored national and food target at westerner as well a western housing be expensive . though most item have cheap alternative .
 drink petrol . it 's cheap than water .
 one liter mineral water be 1.50 riyals and one litter petrol onlu 0.70 dirham ( coin ) but still water for 25 gallon you will get for 6-50 to 8 riyal .
 one liter mineral water be 1.50 riyals and one litter petrol onlu 0.70 dirham ( coin ) but still water for 25 gallon you will get for 6-50 to 8 riyal . you can use boiled water ( from tap ) or mineral water your choice .

 qatarisun - i be not joke . almost all the bank in sl offer the same deal : ) check for yourself . http : //www.hnb.net/ ban spoon feeding not me
 the reason i mention the 5 % be because there be sign post all around town ( last i saw one be about a month ago ) advertise 5 % interest on saving account . i believe it be qnb ; but i 'm not sure . yes ; i 've hear similar bad thing about hsbc . looks like i 'll be look into qnb and commercial bank then . one of my most important requirement be seamless online access and transfer .
 that hnb bank sound intersting too ... thanks for the advice .
 if your company will provide you housing ; usually ; if the housing be not yet ready for occupancy ; they will get a hotel accomodation for you and your family . if it 's ready ; then you 'll be go to your house straight from the airport . like me ; the housing be ready so the company driver deliver me staright there ; unlike my colleague he be stay at the hotel until the housing 's ready .
 when you first arrive to qatar do company put you in a hotel initially ; or straight in housing . i will be travel with one child . i have read that 2 bedroom come with one king bed and a medium bed in the other room ? is the medium bed a queen bed or full size bed ? i would like to know so i know what size sheet to purchase .
 the medium size bed be as size a the double size bed
 if your housing be not ready ; you may be take to a hotel or a serviced apartment ; or guest house/ accommodation . these will be fully furnish . if it a two bedroom apartment ; it 's not necessary that the second room will have a medium size bed ; it may have 2 single bed ; and that can be 90x180 or 120x180 cm . do n't get the sheet for the guest bedroom yet . you may get one king size bed sheet for the master bedroom .
 thank you all ; so i will just bring king sheet for now . is it fairly accessible to get a variety of linen over there ? the high thread count ? or warm sheet for the cooler night ? also blanket ? i be tell to bring a blanket ; could i obtain that over there ?
 they be fairly low-fat if you follow the healthy choice guideline and add lot of veggie . much good than burger and fry or pizza ; for sure . subway be my favorite . i get them to make the sandwich a salad . mandi
 but it be great food .
 it be close by order of the health authority . yikes !
 almost healthys a mcdonalds i guess with all those carbs.. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - he who dares wins
 1- nothing in the qatari law force the current employer to give you a n.o.c . - release you - or transfer your visa to another employer ; it depend on your current employer mode . 2- you should continue one year - 365 - of work for the current employer in order to be eligible for visa transfer even if he permit you to transfer your visa .
 yes u can resign ; but as soon a u resign u will get 2 year ban on your re entry ; for that you speak to your employer and try to get release or noc from the sponsorer .
 generaly in the reputed company if you be hire locally they do n't mind give noc which be your right . anyway do n't resign before confirm with your sponser
 resign ? hi good morning ... qlers.. i be an employee of a private engineering firm.. be work for six months..hired here at doha ( local hire ) .. sponsorship transfer to the company.. work duration 1 year renewable.. the question is.. i want to resign from my work..what be he possibilities..will they allow ? or will they send me home ? please i need your advice.. thanks
 we can only advise you to talk patiently and calmly with your employer/boss to provide noc to u.. yes ; you can resign but do n't expect for the leniency of your boss always.. all the best.. < img src= '' http : //www.pic4ever.com/images/shake2.gif '' border= '' 0 '' >
 company will allow you if you be really desperate to go but you have to follow the condition stipulate in your employment contract .
 unfortunately ; it be entirely up to your sponsor if he want to give you an noc .. most company allow sponsorship transfer if you stay with them minimum of 2 year . ( small number of company do this ; discreetly . ) a you well know ... no noc mean 2 year ban.. : (

 honda civic would be more fuel efficent . for common sense 1800cc engine would consume less fuel than 2400cc .
 honda civic be well
 most of the engine now a day be fuel efficient with the new engineering and technology ; but that would depend on power or let 's say suv 's and 4 x 4 be have powerful engine who will need more fuel everytime you step on accelerator .
 ram .. you be such a great helper .. the site be worthy of view coz of ppl like you be here
 civic ; have the small engine among the 3 choice but toyota yaris be the best or honda city !
 all of them more than 200km/20ltr even if use
 fuel efficient vehicle dear all ; what be the most fuel efficient vehicle out of following ? and please mention the per liter ; how many km it would be ? 1 . nissan altima ( 2008 ) 2 . honda civic ( 2008 ) 3 . honda accord ( 2008 ) thx .
 thanks ya man .. this be what this website be for . help each other .. and this website help me a lot and it 's just time for payback sometimes.. thanks anyway ..
 my friend say quiet cigar be very easy bcoz they do it hundred of time
 its very easy i smoke for 20 year continue just decide and now it 10 year i never smoke . its only decesion ; i do not agree to the people who say it body requirment it only habbit . first two week be only difficult . my friend just decide and thats all .
 before you stop smoke ; i think the best you can do be to stop buying cigarettes .
 best way to get rid of smoke habbit be gradually decrease the number . think of time when you just smoke for the heck of it ; such a with cup of tea ; as soon a you sit in the car etc and then avoid light up one at such time . chew a gum or carry a can of juice with you while in the car or outdoor . dont deprive yourself by just decide to quit ; it will not work . all the best
 it can actually be cheap to go excess baggage - if you 're travel via emirates you will be allow 2 x 30kg bag anyways - qatar air have a very miserly baggage allowance . signature line > `` you ca n't fix stupid ''
 well buy here than bring with pay . too late ; if you move early i might be able to help a my family member be come from sydney and they have only 50 kgs to bring out of 92 kgs
 if it something you absolutely can not live without ; use unaccompanied luggage ; it cheap than excess luggage .
 thank you for all the advice ; look like it culling and excess baggage . bluemountain i would take you up on that offer ; but i be currently in melbourne : ) thanks again .
 < code > < b > yes you would get a visa on arrival ... but dont forget ; they dont accept cash ... so always keep a credit card with you for pay the visa fee : - ) < /code > < /b >
 me eligible for dubai on arrival visa ? ? i be an indian have qatar residence permit ( currently in india ) with a profession of `` administrative '' . let me know be this profession eligible to get dubai on arrival visa ? ? expect reply ... .
 there be no position such a `` administrative '' .. it should be either administrative assistant of administrator .
 the profession you mention be not list so it will be good to check with the airlines first . they will not let you board if the profession be not eligible to get the visa on arrival . there be no credit card payment at dubai airport . you should buy one e-card from the bank counter for the visa charge and that be the only one the immigration will accept and the bank will accept any valid currency accord their exchange rate .
 dxb immigration only accept cash payment at the two exchange counter at the back of the hall . i be there earlier this week and have to join the queue to pay for my egate card : o ( it would probably be wise to send your mandoob with your passport to the uae embassy and get the visa before you travel .
 first- not very advisable to put up the name of the company with your real name . edit that part out . second- as for the salary ; it 's good enough ; not great but not bad either.. families be live on 8 ; 000 qar as well and i meet some family moan about only 50 ; 000 that they get . if he be in sale ; he should get a car from the company so i guess you can cross out that from your expenditure . every sale guy in here get one .
 16k be good enough a salary to survive here in qatar . if you husband can still speak to his company and get an accommodation ; then it will be like an icing on the cake . also ; if he be in sale im sure he should get a car as well a incentive ; fuloos yaani : )
 nice furnish apartment -2 bedroom cost like only 5k+car emi maximum 2k and school in good school maximum 2k so it gon na be ok with this salray.you will have a decent life..
 a good 2bhk would cost you somewhere around qr 6000-8000 ( furnished/semi furnish ) ..and that too depend on the locality ... there be few good indian schools in doha..seeing your baby 's age ; well drop her at kindergarten first which be of in abundance in doha ...

 there be this place on the right hand side when u come down frm ramada signal towards mid-mac round-about ; avoid the bridge and take the round abt ; keep goin straight towards decoration roundabout ; just before the petrol pump ; u wud get 2 c load of tyre shop .
 where be the best place to buy tyre in doha ? i need to purchase two tyre for my car they be 225/60 and i would like to get a good price - any suggestion ?
 same area `` alsboy '' say ... go for `` imalco '' ... you can see the name board ... .

 yes u can get the visit visa without rental agreement go to wakrah immigration center in wakrah and they will not require rental agreement but one thing the wakrah immigration will require minimum salary 5000qr for visit visa ... best of luck
 not a must for visit visa but it be only a supporting document . only sponsor letter state your total salary and noc ; contract copy ; id copy ; pp copy of both ; marriage certificate duly attest by the embassy . with this + above qr 4500 salary ; you stand guarantee .
 i really doubt if rental agreements be mandatory case while apply for visit visa ... check this link out for detail information..thnx http : //www.qatarvisitor.com/index.php ? cid=413 & pid=978
 i have buy a dell studio xps just before move to qatar ; but return it right away . if you 're a picky user ; you will be dissapointed with the amount of heat it can generate . xps be basically a gaming machine . then i have buy a toshiba and very very unhappy with it ; sometime it just stop work . from my previous experience ; ibm t series laptop be the best one ; then dell lattitude series.never buy dell inspiron series ; my wife get one - very cheap make laptop . finally if you have the budget go with the macbook pro - it generate less heat ; battery life be also good and run on bsd unix on the background . you can also visit cnet or amazon.com to see some of the review before even choose one . cheers
 well u have sony on ur list ; i vote for that.. why core 2 duo ? that be so long ago ? ? ?
