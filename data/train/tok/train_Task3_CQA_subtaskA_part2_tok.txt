U4433	komail	2015-01-07 10:00:25	Q201_R26_C1	For family with 2 child ; you ll probably need 2BR flat which will cost about 7000-8000 and for schooling you ll probably need 4000-5000. so it means these two will take major chunk of your salary .

U4433	komail	2015-01-07 10:00:25	Q201_R26_C2	Aamirjaved 's calculation is somewhat on the high side . I believe you should be able to get a 2BR within QR 5000 and also you can easily manage your monthly expenses within QR 2000 . For the schooling ; if you are an Asian ; it is not that costly to my understanding . As such ; my view is that if you are an Asian ; grab the offer ; but if you are a westerner ; kick it .

They very seldom leave those areas ; hence the reason you probably have never seen a `` '' Learner '' '' driver .

SInce you are pregnant your pelvis is expanding which causes pain in your lumbar and pelvic also due to the extra weight . Therefore the best treatment for you is chiropractic ; its not only for your back pain but also for optimum health of the baby and you.The chiropractic approach to better health is to detect ; reduce ; and help pervent nervous system dysfunction .

Once downloaded you just need to install it and then use the search engine on the top right hand side of the interface to search for whatever you want to download ( i.e just type the name of the movie ) . It will take you the mininova.org and once there it is a good idea to sort the findigs by clicking on the heading SEEDS .

Thanks	U4561	Amanda	2009-06-03 15:06:17	Q211_R3_C10	Amoud ; maybe not ; but if a country is going to allow nightclubs then it has to accept that there 's a certain style of dress that comes with them . They seem to want the best of both Worlds ; Western trappings with Qatar conservatism . It wont work . They need to decide what they want and stick with it .

U1255	Withnail	2007-03-05 18:41:56	Q212_R18_C8	what do you think about genesis ' comments ? are there really that many saudis that go to bahrain on the weekends ? how do they ( the women ) treat the western women ( the saudis ; and the more conservative bahrainis . my wife ; who dresses western conservative ; always coverering her shoulders and legs down to her ankles ; often gets dirty looks from many of the women here who are completely covered in black head-to-toe . her sister even got pushed around a little by a couple of them .

U1255	Withnail	2007-03-05 18:41:56	Q212_R18_C9	Well I date a Saudi so I have to say he and his friends treat me very respectfully . Yes lot 's of them do go to Bahrain on the weekends ; but so do a lot of Qataris and Kuwatis . The place is basically crawling with people from the more conservative nations on the weekend . Besides the fact that the number of land cruisers increases and there are more people in the pubs I have n't noticed a difference . As for dress ; I can dress less conservatively in Bahrain than here . There are more single women as well so I do n't feel like I stand out so much . Bahrani girls do n't wear the abaya as much as here and I have n't seen to many in hijab . I doubt she 'll notice many stares at all . As for it becoming more conservative ; well they are closing down all the bars in the 3 star hotels because that 's where all the prosititutes hang out . But my guess is you wo n't even notice they are gone .	Good	U181	Gypsy	2007-03-06 14:20:40

Their instructors are first-rate ; but their transportation service is completely unreliable and their office staff rude and barely competent . If you have your own way to the school ; take them as the drivers are excellent ; but they are let down by the disorganization and lack of professionalism of the management .

Personally you should just have a warm body to curl up with . If it is too cold for one get a second and snuggle up . Skin on skin is the best way to stay warm and transfer body heat .

Too many 'support staff ' from third world countries that do n't wash their hands . Only go with British run ones and then I would check out the number of 'cheap labor ' staff they had . Look at is this way ; if you were paying a lot of money for a supposed decent Nursery ; you would expect the staff to be trained . Over here we do n't have that . Most of them have 'degrees ' from a Mickey Mouse University . They say they have degrees in Nursing ; Education and Admin . Most ca n't speak English . Really do your research ; it is crap over here with the number of third world people who say they have degrees and then do n't even know what they are supposed to be talking about . They are desperate for jobs and will lie to get one . They do n't care at all that your kid’s education may be hindered by them lying . Just be careful .	Good	U2	anonymous	2009-03-04 00:03:59

You can still get nice villas on older compounds but they do n't seem to be building large gardens with new compounds ... very tight .

I am most concerned about garden rather than location and I think judging by what I have found out so far location is very important on how much villas cost . My husband has been out for a trip already and says that there are really no horrible places to live in Doha at al ! An older or stand alone villa sounds like the bext chance of having a garden attached .

U3633	Charlene	2012-09-02 18:31:00	Q222_R16_C8	30QR per hour seems to be the standard charge for private arrangements for house cleaning here in Doha plus you might have to pay a transportation charge too depending where she/he is coming from - hopefully you will find someone local in Al Khor ! Most cleaners here are either Philipino 's ; Sri Lankans or Indonesians . I have a Philli lady and she is very thorough . Speaking English reasonably well also helps ! Why would you want someone 6 hrs a day 3 times a wk ? Unless you also want someone for child minding . My cleaning lady does top and bottom of our 3 bed villa in 3 hours and does a good job . She comes twice a week mostly to get rid of the dust that continually seeps in from all cracks n crevices ! LOL We do outsource ironing though and I do our washing ! If you can find a good laundry service in Al Khor it should be quite cheap and satisfactory ! Ours pick up and deliver too . Good luck in your search and hope this helps !

We 'd first meet up at my grandfather 's home . We 'd all talk and the children would plan 3ayuding . We 'd all go from house to house ; sing a song and look cute and be given 1 riyal . After going door to door ; we 'd go back home and play until it was time to eat the large feast . Parents would usually chat . Families get together . People visit and they have some tea and snacks .

Ramadan should be a month of less ( material things ) and more ( spirituality ) . For a lot it is . Our schedules do not change much ( eg . we do not eat all night which negates the point of fasting in my opinion ) . We break our fast at sunset with a small light meal . Then we have dinner in the evening . We get up before dawn for a small breakfast . We try to be better Muslims in this month ... in the hope we can carry this on throughout the year . I do see Qatar changing from when I was a child during Ramadan . This is something to do with us ; of course ; and also the influx of expats . _______________________________________________________ Love is the answer ...	Good	U209	diamond	2007-09-23 22:47:34

Usually the night before ( or earlier if you 're really organised ) we gather the kids around and make some biscuits and traditional sweets . These are then ready to distribute during the Eid prayer and also to the neighbours . They are also really handy when people come to visit you during Eid . What I 've noticed here in Qatar is that friends and neighbours seem to visit each other a lot more on Eid than back home . I guess it 's because we do n't have family here ; so our friends tend to become our new support structure . On the 2 Eids that I 've so far spent in Qatar our 'new ' tradition seems to be going to City Centre and getting some good sale items ! LOL I guess that 's our variation on spending the day at the park ( too hot ) or visiting the grandparents ( too far ) or staying at home ( too boring ) .	Good	U2056	ummsumaya	2007-09-24 07:54:39

Nowehere as good as Schoffer Hoffer but a good compromise considering you 're in an almost dry nation . So if you 're a SH fan like me ; drink your fill before you come over . I remember that terrible desperation when Dan Murphy 's stopped stocking this beer in Melbourne . After a brief search I found it at Vintage Liquors ( Coles ) . You can get your share of euro lagers as mentioned by previous posters . As a true blue Aussie ; I 'm sure you 'd understand if I said I can piss better than a Bud and wo n't touch Fosters with a stick . VB ; Guinness and Kilkenny can be found here too . Sadly no XXXX or Carlton Cold . If you 're feeling adventurous or want to slum it ; try Kingfisher Strong . As an Indian I 'd also recommend the regular Kingfisher ( American style macro lager ) . Not similar to the one that can be purchased in Oz . That 's made in New Zealand under license .	Good	U2	anonymous	2007-01-17 22:00:12

In summer it was gin and tonics ; and wine too . We did n't have vodka in the house ; but it 's good for teens because you can mix it with juices and soft drinks . In my opinion consuming the infrequent alcoholic beverage is a much better option than giving your kids soft drinks ; chips ; chocolate ; sweet snacks ; candy and burgers on a daily basis .

Instead drink hot water ; or if necessary eat ripe sweet fruit . # Avoid reheated or stale food . # Most of one 's food should be cooked ; as the body can more easily absorb cooked food . Raw food should be eaten only as a side dish ( e. g. salad ) . # Make use of culinary spices . They not only make the food tasty ; but support the digestive processes as well . # Include all 6 tastes in each meal : sweet ; sour ; salty ; pungent ; bitter ; and astringent . The tastes also have their own influence on the subtle inner balance of the physiology . # During meals you may sip liquids such as water ; juice or lassi . Do not drink a lot and avoid ice-cold drinks - they dampen down the digestive processes . # Milk should not be drunk with the main meal .

Do n't eat grain ; cereal or pulses item with acidic items like citrus fruits ; grapes ; pineapple etc . Protein rich food items go well with low-carb food items like rice and vegetable . Vegetables also go well with all types of starchy ; carbohydrate rich food items . Fruits should ideally be taken as a separate meal ; independent of other regular meals . Milk and meat is bad combination . Never take milk and meat in a single meal . Separate intake of milk and meat by at least four hours . Milk and meat is good for body in several ways . When taken together ; it becomes toxic . Many modern food styles fly on the face of this Ayurvedic food combination rule . Milk is also to be taken warm . Cold milk can cause indigestion .

U2842	grandkruizer	2007-05-04 13:14:14	Q231_R20_C9	I agree with e46 ... park the car immediately . There can be several causes . If overheating ; you will have a more whitish smoke mixed with steam . Do not just put water in the reservoir ... you will need to use anti-freeze ; but you will also need to have your thermostat checked out . If its greyish/blackish smoke ; you 're burning oil and you most likely have a broken head gasket or valve ... both of these conditions are indicative of the worst case scenario . Also ; do n't forget to check your tire pressure every time you refuel .	Bad	U1138	C4 993 Driver	2007-05-04 16:53:06

You never know who these people may be but you lock eyes with them ; you know that very moment that they will affect your life in some profound way . And sometimes things happen to you at the time that may seem horrible ; painful and unfair ; but in reflection you realize that without overcoming those obstacles you would never realize your potential ; strength ; will power or heart . Everything happens for a reason . Nothing happens by chance or by means of luck . Illness ; love ; lost moments of true greatness and sheer stupidity all occur to test limits of your soul . Without these small tests ; life would be like a smoothly paved ; straight ; flat road to nowhere safe and comfortable but dull and utterly pointless . The people you meet affect your life .

I thought the band was pretty good ; maybe I was hypnotized by the daisy duke shorts the singers were wearing though .

Kinda reminded me of a high school dance in the gymnasium ; buncha guys standing around leering at the girls . Hopefully after the Asian Games they will take everyone 's advice and at least paint the walls and dim the lights to iimprove the atmosphere of the place .

Many clubs are just institutions to carry on drinking after normal club closing time and to pick up members of the opposite sex .

A big complex with bowling ; billiard ; electronic games for adults strongly required ... About Alaaddin 's Kingdom ; it is the only theme park with nothing ! It should be more inviting ... with some little theatre shows ; animal shows ; high quality electronic video games ; good food ; some recreation near sea ...

( maybe a dozen buildings ) I think they all have onsite management that can show you what is available . Personally ; I think the Pearl and Falcon Towers adjacent to the 4 Seasons Hotel are the best units and best located especially if you are able to join the Four Seasons Spa / Health Club . Al Farden Tower ( where the BMW dealer is located ) is very nice ; but no balconies if that is important to you . 44 Westbay Tower also has very nice units and great views from the upper floors .

They are not what you would consider a pet shop to be ... .like petsmart or petco etc . Royal Canin can be purchased at the veterinary surgery .

If they do n't have the specific for persians ; they 'll probably order it for you . I think their website is www.dohavets.com or something like that . If I may suggest ; if you use an enclosed litter box ; bring one with you ; as they are very expensive here ( QR250 for a really cheap looking one ) . Also bring toys ; they are not easy to find here . And stuff like nail clipper as well . Oh ; and frontline is also quite expensive here ; and I have n't found the specific one for cats ; the vet told me to simply put less of the dog one . Anyway ; those are the things you should know if you 're bringing kittie with you .	Good	U286	Fatcat	2008-05-10 15:58:25

Alcohol will be confiscated ; no doubt about it ; but the pork seems to be winked at as it goes through the scanner . I 've never heard of anyone being detained or arrested for bringing either into the country - the alcohol was simply confiscated and they were warned not to try and bring it again . Nationality and ethnicity may play a role here . I 'm a white Western middleaged female . Asian and other people of colour may have a different experience and perhaps someone can speak to that point . Many Westerners here travel to UAE or Bahrain and bring back pork with no incident ( in my 2+ years here ) .	Good	U487	marycatherine	2009-05-04 06:57:02

Both are leavening agents for wheat bread . Both act in the same way .	PotentiallyUseful	U49	edifis	2008-11-21 11:03:48

U1255	Withnail	2008-05-16 13:58:33	Q244_R21_C1	shortening is available all over ; try the oil aisles ; down with the ghee . i think i bought mine in the carrefour in city centre . have n't seen bran ; have n't really looked though . not sure its that readily available ? try the cold cereal aisle ? perhaps that explains the rather white brown bread . the rye bread i bought today must have had only 1 grain of rye as well . was delicious ; but not very strong in the rye department . another ingredient that seems to be fairly rare is baking soda . can always find baking powder .

So when someone ( not only a SUV at 120 ) but a car driving at 60 to 80 comes ; the accident is inevitable . Just go to Najma in the end of the day to see the same .

''	U2	anonymous	2009-04-02 20:48:46	Q246_R27_C4	According to my experience ; open NRI direct account with commercial Bank & ICICI bank ; this gives you current account in commercial bank ; NRE account in ICICI bank & if you are interested in Share/mutual fund online trading then ICICI online trading account facility is best . you can transfer money from commercial bank account to your ICICI NRE account online & transfer happens in one working day . Also I would like to mention one point here that for online money transfer ; Dohabank exchange rates are always better than commercial bank ; so for me I have also opened a Dohabank saving account which I use for online money transfer to ICICI NRE account & This transfer is also fast ; most of the time one working day .

The transfers online occur instantly most of the time and the rates offered by Doha bank are the best in here compared to all other banks and the exchange houses . The customer service by Axis bank in India ( at least in Kochi ; Kerala ) is excellent .

U4884	usmi	2014-02-03 00:30:12	Q246_R41_C3	1 - If you leave with any bank debts/credit card debts/bad checks ; this will create a problem for your sponsor . In that case the sponsor might blacklist you from getting a work visa in Qatar or anywhere else in the GCC . Additionally if there are issues with the bank ; they may send a collection agency after you even in your home country to recover any money that you owe . 2 - There could be problems ; it depends on point 1 . 3 - The bank account will technically remain active . It does n't close down at the expiration of your RP ; otherwise all Qatar residents would need to go to the bank every time they renew their RP . If you have a monthly account fee over time this will bring the account into negative balance ; creating a potential problem for you and your sponsor . Leave peacefully and do the right thing by your sponsor . If you leave by going on holiday and not coming back you are only going to make a problem for yourself later .

Thanks	U4909	msmay	2007-06-27 15:38:30	Q246_R76_C10	Well I think it’s a rip off . No such thing as the best bank . I left Doha Bank because of poor customer service and went to QNB which am happy with . With QNB ; you have to have a minimum of Qr 3 ; 000 in your current account always . It’s a compulsory savings scheme . Plus ; you get .25 % in your savings account and if you take out a mortgage loan you pay 8.5 % . Be careful ; read the small prints . I do n't trust banks here .

On personal loans ; I am not sure but banks take time before issuing them . Banking here is different from the west . when you arrive to work here your company usually has facilities with certain banks so you can only take facilities from those banks ( you can open in any bank a savings account but you will not get any facilities with it ) . some of the larger companies can send your salary to any bank and then it is up to you to choose . Note that Vehicle loans tend to be straight forward as the bank co-owns your vehicle until you pay your loan back however ; personal loans take more time ( at least a couple of month where your salary is transferred regularly ) before it is approved . Here ; there is no credit history that you can transfer with you . it is all about where your salary gets transferred and which company is sponsoring you .

Their range of services and their network are really convenient for customers add to this their accurate customer service . CBQ is the best bank in Qatar when it comes to a number of services like Online ; call center . ( I also have account in QNB and I know quite well about Doha Bank ) IBQ does n't have online service at all . Network ; CBQ is the bank that has the widest presence in malls ( Hyatt ; Villagio ; city center ; lulu HM ; Landmark ) with all convenience this brings to customers in terms of proximity and working hours . Customer service in CBQ is better than that of QNB and Doha bank . I 'm not talking about people who smile only but about their accuracy and professionalism as well . They may be less flexible than other banks but for me personally I preferred their services over all other banks ( and I have dealt with many of them )	Good	U1819	Gus	2008-06-18 08:03:58

Call center agents of CBQ are really professionals and very well trained staff . They have a excellent telephone manners . Doha bank call center very poor ; I always feel like I 'm not welcome to ask any questions for what else I want to know . Sometimes they need to transfer to another agent but I 'm not satisfied of their answers regarding my problem . Standard Chartered bank is trying too much to be the best but I 'm sorry to them they are very far from CBQ call center . They register me to receive sms if ever any transactions made from my account . Only one time I receive sms from them . QNB is one of the worst ; I 've issued cheques for my car loan and I have agreement with the person responsible for my cheques but still it 's nothing .

I do have a fixed rate loan apparently it means nothing to them . I should feel better that this change is across the board ; 'for everybody ; new and exsisting loans ' ( in case I felt left out ; I suppose ) . What was really amusing was how I was told this is an International Bank ( ? ? ? ) and keeps up with the markets hence interest rates can go up and down . I do n't seem to recall them going down when the US Dollar hit rock bottom ! ! ! Also regarding not informing me about the increase ... .'we have 1000 's of customers we ca n't tell everybody ! ' I wish I could say they were saving the environment by not sending out letters but what 's the excuse for not sending an email or text ? Anyway long story short ; I 'm moving banks and am very glad to ; good riddance to old rubbish .

Do n't be amused by this word ( The World 's Local Bank ) ; they are right in it 's local ; but it 's not universal . you can ask them about something to do with another HSBC world wide ; they will tell you : sorry ; there is no networks between our banks in the world ; so it 's just local bank . I 'm telling you this ; since I 'm dealing with five different bank in Qatar ; and HSBC was even lower level than others ; it 's just a big name ; the only good thing about them ; that they provide you parking in the main branch in Banks street . I think Doha ; Almashreq ; and the commercial banks are better options . Best regards	Good	U2466	oabazeed	2008-05-10 04:02:28

But I do n't suggest the OP to go for Air Arabia as it has only slight difference with the air ticket rates compared with the Fly Dubai .

Bangkok is probably your best bet as I expect that 's where you 're flying to/from ; and it has plenty to do for 5 days . The Lonely Planet has plenty of good suggestions of what to do ; but I can give you more specific ideas if you want . We also went to Chiang Mai in the north which is lovely . Still a city with lots to see in and around it ; but it seems to have a far more chilled vibe than Bangkok . If you fancy proper chilling then I 'd recommend down south . We stayed on the Andaman coast at Khao Lak and Ko Lanta ( north and south of Phuket respectively ) . Both had a nice relaxed atmosphere - not as manic as I 'm led to believe Phuket is .

These sites usually have a great line up of hotels and their basic rates with facilities available including their pictures . Once you have identified the hotel you would like to stay in ; search for the hotel name on google and book the rooms from the hotel website . Majority of hotels offer best rates available in the market thru their own website .

Air fares with Qatar Airways is approx QR3 ; 000 to Thailand ; you may find cheaper fares with Gulf Air ; leaving you QR 2 ; 000 for hotels etc . Take a look at Air Asia 's web site . It is SE Asia 's budget airline and can fly you cheaply and connecting you to nearby neighbouring countries and has many hotel prices listed too .

U4992	NajamAhmed	2008-03-28 09:06:03	Q256_R13_C3	Ql members are easily identifiable in a crowd . Just watch out for the following characteristics . a ) The males will have long flowing beard ( Look at my avatar for an idea about how it would look ) ; which will be always unkempt and unruly . If there is a bird which has nested in his beard ; that means he is the most senior among them and also the wisest . I tried to make a nest in my beard and invite a bird in ; but none would touch it . I wonder why ? b ) b ) The females will almost always have flowing ; shiny ; silver hair and they will have eyes lined in VIBGYOR – all colours of the rainbow . The more colours they have around their eyes ; the more senior in QL they are . Age does not come in here . All of them are very young and nubile . Its very easy to find them in a crowded place because if two QL ladies get together ; they will start singing “my heart will go on” at the top of their voices . c ) HABITAT They are usually found near beaches and shopping malls where they go away for their hunting ... ..

Each time he shook hands with a person ; two birds came out through the two sides of his beard singing `` '' cuckoo ; cuckoo '' '' . I envied him . I didnt have even ONE bird in my beard while he had two . I also saw a few bisuit crumbs on his beard . I have a strong suspicion that he is using Britania bisuits to lure the birds into his beard . I have made a proposal to the birds saying that i would give them swiss chocolate biscuits if they relocated . Lets see how the negotiations go . Will have to stamp their RP 's very soon so that they dont leave me anytime soon . Note to self : Give birds Residence permit ; land cruiser allowance ; two way tickets ( even if they can fly on their own ) and a free hand in doing what they will with their nest s ; provided it will ALWAYS remain within MY beard !

Because the weather is awful.But once you get to Oct-Nov. you will enjoy it . Regarding the shipment ; there is no point in doing that since the company will provide you with a fully furnished appartment/villa.You will find everything here ( house-holds ; china ; etc ) at a reasonable price . Visa-it depends on how fast the company you will be working for is .

In this case I would suggest you to renew your Passport before you go on leave as you do not have too many days left . You are planning to come back at the end of April and in case if you are not able to travel your Passport will get expired and you will be in trouble . So play safe .

I can assure you that in India ; some people have a REALLY high cost of living . Like anywhere else ; you can get very similar foods/item for very cheap or very expensive . Depends on how rich you are and on your lifestyle . Average living standards and governmental services vary between a 3rd world country and Europe but that is it . Plus ; if someone is living here ; who cares how much a soda can costs back home ? Why ca n't that person Mr ( kumar ) enjoys his weekend in Qatar like Mr ( John ) does with his family ?

U2492	Iamthexxx	2012-06-11 13:26:09	Q258_R71_C7	Also BE ; having worked in HR here for a while ; it is common practise for companies to ask what your current salary is and they will base their offers on that . For instance ; 2 Civil Engineers ; one from the US and one from Philippines you will find that the one from the philppines will be on say 8000QAR and maybe the one from the states will be on 21QAR ( in their home country ) . HR will base their offer on how much extra ( or not ) they can get away with offering above what they currently earn . So you ca n't give someone who is on 8kqar currently over 20k and similarly you can not offer someone who is on 21k less than that because he thinks ; why would I want to come here for less than I am currently earning at home . Also back to BE 's point ; rents ; mortgages general cost of living in India and Philippines is much less than it is in most of Europe and North america .

If someone can not save for a better life when they go home ; will simply not come in the first place and companies have slowly realised that hiring all from one nation does not work ; so they have to pay more for a mix of people . However ; what I have noticed is that people from say india who have lived in the ME a while ; their salaries do start to become more equitable as they change jobs - based on their current salary and each time they change ; voila ; their salaries go up . What I also notice is that alot of westerners ; their salaries do not change much ; they were already being paid the top for what they are doing and can not get much higher by changing jobs .

If you really wish from your bottom of heart ; then chances to quit smoking is more . But if is because someone is insisting or due to health reason ; then you may really need more efforts .

I still dream of smoking and feel I am just a millimeter ( or a puff ) away from being an addict again . Do n't allow yourself even a single puff for me . Stay away from ambience which makes you feel like smoking . Quit one hundred percent . Do n't give any concessions to yourself ; be ruthless . Positives of quitting far outweigh the negatives . I did gain weight but reduced it as I could execise better now . Smoking anyway is outlawed almost everywhere . It 's out of fashion too . I do n't blame my previous generation for glorifying it as they did know less about the harms . If someone picks up the habit now or still continues with it then he or she definitely is an ignorant person . It makes you sick and smelly .	Good	U2	anonymous	2011-11-10 18:30:16

Fireheartin ; look before you make such a big mistake of your life stop to reconsider this whole `` '' giving up '' '' . What are you going to gain by giving up smoking ? Live healthier ? Live longer ? lol these are all myths to giving up smoking just to make you feel better about yourself . Its not easy to give up smoking depending on how long you have been smoking . Also WHY ! why put your body through such mental and physical stress to resist the urge to have that beautiful puff ! let me list out a few advantages of smoking 1 . Taking a crap in the morning is so much more relaxed and mentally soothing when your on the throne with a ciggie . Its just comes out better . 2 . Say your the only guy who doesnt smoke and all your other friends smoke ; you 'll be looked as that `` '' loser '' '' guy . Your not a loser when you smoke ; you make MORE friends when you smoke .

When I use to smoke ; i leave the office to smoke and interrupt work ; i make my car smelling cigarrets ; it destroyed my health and i become like a dog after running for a minute or so .

I do recommend having a cover for it else the dust and grit will quickly work its charm . You can change the hoses and connections fairly easily once you arrive .

You will need to decide if it 's wiser to spend the extra on shipping or perhaps buy locally . Aramex are a cost effective shipper from the states and the UK . When you join their Shop & Ship service they give you a postal address in the USA and UK . You have you items delivered to that address ; and then they forward your goods to a depot here at reasonable rates . I do n't think selling items on eBay is a viable option from Qatar .

U1748	5m4rtGlamour	2010-01-11 00:44:10	Q266_R51_C8	Ebay is good.. two things . mind where you are buying the stuff from . if you are buying from china or Hongkong ; then the seller would ship the item to Qatar with HK post which is cheap and most of the times he offers it free ; but the wait time is minimum one month and 45 days is normal . you can opt to get it by HK registered post too with additional shipping cost ranging from $ 4 to $ 20 ; which is much faster and secure . if you are buying from other countries like US ; the standard shipping is done with USPS which is no better than HK post ; its take a month too ; alternatively if you opt to get it shipped with UPS/DHL/FedEx from the buyer ; then price for shipping ranges anywhere from $ 140 . alternatively to buy from the US seller is Easyshop by DHL ; or shop n ship by Aramex . check their website to know how they work .

Something cheaper than that : Acer has some laptops that are very cheap but give very good performance .
