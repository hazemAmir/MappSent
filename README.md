MappSent
========

a Textual Mapping Approach for Question-to-Question Similarity
______________________________________________________________

We introduce *MappSent*, a novel approach for textual similarity. Based on a linear sentence embedding representation, its principle is to build a matrix that maps sentences in a joint-subspace where similar sets of sentences are pushed closer. We evaluate our approach on  the SemEval 2016/2017 question-to-question similarity task and show that overall MappSent  achieves competitive results and outperforms in most cases state-of-art methods.
