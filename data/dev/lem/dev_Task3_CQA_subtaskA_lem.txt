( blood money for non-moslems be pretty minimal ; anyway . ) for car over a certain age ; ( 2 year ? dunno ) 3rd party be the only option . however ; and again a note above ; cover for passenger be not automatic so check these thing carefully with your insurance broker . even the possibility of have residual alocohol in your bloodstream when some idiot slam into you some morning have to be specifically cover ; so it 's not a bad idea to go to a reputable international insurance company if you think you might occasionally have non-family passenger or drink beer of an evening .
