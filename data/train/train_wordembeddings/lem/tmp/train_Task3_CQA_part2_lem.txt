we use to rent a car for 1490 qar a month  but you have to make a 6 month contract with them  it be call oasis rental car  i do n t know if they still have the same deal 
you be right  oasis rant a car be advertise in the marhaba qatar s info guide  1 395 month   min  6 month  does anybody know other company offer similar deal  regards 
al obaidly trading  5th floor at mercure hotel  we rent there for qr1800  but there be package at qr1500  look for thomas chacko  cheers  bunga  
do n t rent  good buy a car   
like dracula say  buy  dont rent  but for that price  you can go to obeidly  in sofitel   but i think they have old car  some run alright but i would avoid them  they do have some good price on the new car though  just dont rent from petra  they have lousy car and they rip their client off  the charge their credit card without consent and then refuse to help settle the issue  
qatar living lounge what happen if i break my lease in doha  my lease in my current place end in december  but frankly i m sick of pay for my overpriced rent while all around me price be drop  i wonder if everyone know what the legal repercutions be of skip out on my lease  
 and you can be out without hassle  one year clause be not legal  source   a study conducted by friedunicorn  vol i  september  1999  
you ll definitely lose your deposit and will probably get chase for the remainder of the rent  why not just stay put for another few months  
i know  but it s a pain to keep wait  i m go to loose my deposit anyway thanks to some paint my old roomate do  so that s not really a concern  
you can negotiate with your landlord  i pay half month rent only for breach the lease agreement  it be best rather than pay overpriced flat 
good suggestion hasmub  it s really bother me that i can get a villa for 2000 qr le  and close to my work to  then my apartment  
dont you have the contract  havent you read it   
that would be the smart thing to do da   p 
you can give him one month notification befor u leave  if it in your rental contract  
ya i just speak to him and he say i have to pay the remainder of the rent   s that seem a bit steep  
i know  i m go to try and go in on friday  however i know the best way to get to him be through his secretary

working in qatar salary v cost of living doha family with 2 kid  9  5 year old   both school go salary package of 20k  with no other benefit  is it a good deal  
for family with 2 child  you ll probably need 2br flat which will cost about 7000 8000 and for school you ll probably need 4000 5000  so it mean these two will take major chunk of your salary  further you can take 3000 monthly live expense and 2000 for conveyance  additionally any medical requirement  now it upto you to decide  
aamirjaved s calculation be somewhat on the high side  i believe you should be able to get a 2br within qr 5000 and also you can easily manage your monthly expense within qr 2000  for the schooling  if you be an asian  it be not that costly to my understanding  as such  my view be that if you be an asian  grab the offer  but if you be a westerner  kick it  
we ca n t say if it s a good deal  you do n t include detail of the role  try to get school include in the package  agree with aamirjaved  depends on what standard of living you want  depending on area  you may need 10k  for a nice 2 bed  
agree with aamirjaved  
ezdan 2 bedroom fully furnished you get in qr 5500  school asian with transportation for 2 kid 750 x2  1500 and qr 3000 living expense and qr 1000 miscellaneous  so net savings qr 9000 a of my 10 year experience in doha live with family  
no enough for the near future a qatar be get more expensive not yearly  you can feel it every 4 5 month  
i will suggest to go for unfurnished property  it will cost you around qr 4000 4800 depends on locality  asian school with transportation for two kid 1000 x2  qr 2000  qr 2000 for live expense and qr 500 for transport  total cost of living would be qr 8500  9300  you can save qr 10500  but it totally depend on your live standard  
1 2bhk  qr 5000 pm 2 furniture allowance incl all house hold item  for one time  qr 14000  16000  for two bed room flat  schooling for tow kid incl transport  asian   qr 1800 3 net  phone  qr 600 4  house living expenses  qr 2500 5  miscellaneous  qr 1000 if you be from india then the cost of living should be like allmost the same   
if you have decide to join this qatar company  you mus to attest your educational certificate for attestation  translation purpose please contact to sheenservices wll  website  http  sheenservices com contact us html 44366147 55974495 
if you be asian you should be fine with it  if you be european you would n t be fine with it all a the school and the rent fee will eat up much of it

canon eos rebel t1i  canon 500d  in qatar be qr 2998 which be around  821     
you can get this for about the same price  around 2000 qr  here as well but you need to check at 3  4 place for a comparison  there be an undefinable difference in price even on major brand here in qatar  
i check lulu  carrefour and the price i find be qr 2999  2998    where do i find it  qr 2000 here  
because there be not too much specialty store that caters only professional camera  dslrs   mostly camera store can be find only in mall but they be not specialty store  you know how mall owner jack up price of good  especially if it come or import outside doha  if you have friend in uae  you can ask them to buy you one and just ship it you  or  there be some people sell dlsrs here in ql  you can search the classified ad here  
omar1733  thanx mate  i ll check   
you can try gulf foto in musheirib area  
you can try b  h which be a trusted one  they can ship here or if you know somebody in us or travel there you can ask them to buy it for you  that s what i do  my friend have order too from some seller in ebay  mostly d90

which company dude   
hi arshad124  sorry but i cant reveal the company detail  whts ur opinion  be 12k good enough  
hmmm  depend on which company you know   
seriously message me the company atleast   
firstly it depend on your life style  and then if you be get more then 12000qar  in dubai then better off to stay there  the desicion be all yours  
well the salary seem to be good  but if you be bring your family then house of 2bk without furnish and good lcoation would not cost you less then 4000 qr  then furnuiture and basic requirement that shall shoot upto 10k  so indirect 5k per month would be the rent  then car if you go for high end car apprx start from 100000 to 123000 then monthy emi would be between 4000 to 4500  then food and other expensies now it be totallly depend on how you spend it dude  according to me it good salary  but spend wisely and save for your further  
 arshad124 mate sorry again but i cant mention it  and whts the company name get to do with this salary   flyingace  i make arround 9k here in dubai  this job pay more but i hav hear it quite costly there  my lifesytle be more or less simple  i pa 
hi qatartalks  well i be a bachelor for now and no plan to get married soon also i plan to export my car from dubai to doha  how much do a decent studio cost at wakrah  saving be important to me and also i will need tht for a future family life so with 12k salary would like to calculate wht my expense would be  thanx for the support  
not worth the change for just 3000 extra  nothing compare to dubai  here thing be not that economical a oppose to the thought  i be in dubai  and i believe that dubai be now much good  a compare to what it use to be  but again  compare the prospect when u change the job  what be the growth prospect  keep bear in mind  the cost of living be go to increase  and rate of inflation will be much high than dubai  
hi zuzo  well the growth prospect later on for me would be well  a of now i be change my line of work if i set a target of 2 year in doha and then head back to dubai then i myt have a good growth when i get back here  thank u for that honest comment  i still have 2 week to decide  dubai be good  but chance of landing in a good job be less now i have be here for 3 year and the market be not good a it use to be  but inflation in qatar i agree myt be higher if i be aim at just 2 year  whts your opinion  
salary and allowances is 30000 qar good enough salary for a couple to move to qatar  moving to qatar soon  have receive an offer of qar 30k  be that good enough for a couple to be in qatar  we have no kid  
that s good offer  welcome to qatar     
i be receive less than that and i have move to qatar with wife and 3 kid and yet somehow we manage to survive  surely 30k qr will be more than good enough for you and your wife to live and enjoy life in doha  
i be receive less than that and i have move to qatar with my wife and 3 kid and yet somehow we manage to survive  surely 30k qr will be more than good enough for you and your wife to live and enjoy life in doha  
oh come on  be you stupid or what  that be good money and you know it  if you ca n t figure out if that be a good enough salary then you do n t deserve that amount  
it depend on your live standard and expectation for saving  in this connection it be important to know do all allowance  specialy accomodation allowance  be include or not in this amount  for example rent of a villa will be in the range of 12  000  20  000 qr etc  good luck 
do you think that you will earn that amount in your country     cmon   and how come a lot of expats are coming to work instead in their home country      dont be so silly   
it depend if it be exclude the accomodation or include because if you want to live in a villa you need something like 10000 qr monthly and if it it be include then you will end up with 20000 which be enough to live a meduam life for you and your family to be honst i think it be a good salary for an engineer or maybe senior person so go a head and good luck 
depend which one be your life style  is the accommodation pay by company  and the car  3000 for rent   do you like compound villa  12000  or apartment  7000   do you like club  500 per month   do you like drink alcohol  500 per month   do you like go to restaurant  700 per month   your wife like new clothes  1000 per month   qr 30 000 be not enough for western couple  
if it s not at least 3x what you be earn in your home country then i think that would not be enough just my two cent 
for a manager from uk  it be reasonable  not too good  you need qr6500  2 br appartment with out gym  swim pool   14000  4br compound villa with swim pool  gym etc  for accomodation 2300 for car  300 for petrol  2500 for food  if you cook  2000 for week end outing  1500 for child education  all togeter around qr15000 will go a minimum expense  if you be bless with free accommodation  this salary be very good  
visas and permits degree attestation  urogulf or helpline  have you use helpline or urogulf to get your degree attest  has anyone use them to get their degree attest from the us  what be that experience like  did they help you  rip you off

thanks for the tip about urogulf  has anyone try helpline  my problem be i do n t have family in the us who would help me get the degree attest  so i probably need some outside help  
urogulf be the best service provider they r do the genuine work plus they r give the assurance of the certificate which be most important quality have some price

qatar living lounge i get traffic signal fine hi few month ago i get a fine a broke red signal  and it be around 6000qr and i go there nd request them bt there be nt listening and tellig me that you have to pay    anyone who know how to reduce this fine  pls tell me    thank you so much 
do n t run red you fool  
how about few week of jail also                                
hey guys why blaming him  donnt u experience that ur about to stop b4 signal becomes red  suddenly one landcruser behind u give u flash light  a biiiiig horn so u become panic  i donnt understand why they are not installing digital anticlock time  e g  30 seconds  between orange to red signal  it will b very easy to make a decision wether to pass or not       
nope  and no need for cap lock  red light mean stop  stop  if you do n t understand this you do n t deserve to be behind the wheel  
 the light give a six second warning  it should be sufficient for both decision making and brake  it s good that you have situational awareness of the vehicle behind you but in the end it be you who will have to pay the fine  i m afraid that the   he make me do it   defense wo n t work  mandi  
the law  just pay the fine  my thought be my own  but i doubt my mum would agree with some of them  
30 seconds warn   lol  all green signal be 30 40 second  warning should n t be more than 5 6 sec  and if your speed be under 80  you should be fine   you become responsible forever for what you have tamed   antoine de saint exup ry 
try to bargain with them maybe you can lower the price  just like in the souq    and if you be a regular customer  next time you will get 10  discount on traffic fine  it s true that have working have n t kill anyone yet  but why to take risk  
 khalid now you make another mistake by use such word in a public forum i increase your fine to 12000 riyals    hatred be the coward s revenge for be intimidate    g b  shaw  
when i broked singal there be not flip 3time yellow light i think i have time to cross signal so i do this mistake 
advice and help red light can someone tell me  at what point do it take a pic of you and fine you for cross the red light  if you cross while the yellow be on  can you stil get fin  let say you cross the line and stop the car  and the light becomes red  what will happen then  thanks 
 i ve be beat a yellow blinking light since the time i cant remember but have no fine so far  i think it only cross the line when it already red                      silent   g    
 and by the way  my simple rule in cross the signal  red  mean stop  green  mean go   yellow  mean go faster                         silent   g    
good point buller  r u sure about this  i be under the impression that there be some kind of beam that we cut when we pass that line or something like that  
how about just stop when the green be not visible  better for you  others driver  your passenger and potentially your wallet  
agree dude  but sometimes  with your speed  it might be too late to stop before the light turnes red  some of these light dont blink before turn from green to yellow  and you find yourself pass the stopping point  
agree dude  but sometimes  with your speed  it might be too late to stop before the light turnes red  some of these light dont blink before turn from green to yellow  and you find yourself pass the stopping point  
you can get away with the yellow orange one  i always prefer to stop when i see the green blinking   have courage to live  anyone can die  
if you stop when the light be green or orange will be charge with obstruct the traffic  and zoom through these green or orange at high speed  will be charge for speed  
if the light go red before you cross the big  thick  white line  then a sensor will be trigger and a photo take  as eternity say  the camera will take multiple exposure to determine if you continue through the junction  if the light go red and you nudge a bit too far forward and there be a flash  just stop  
i m colour blind  so i wait for the blinking light at the top of the tree and just stop  
advice and help traffic ticket rules hi all  think i am in trouble  while passing a flashing green light i kind of thought the radar took a pic of me  everybody is telling me that the ticket is only for red light passing can anyone help  
no ticket for cross over a flashing green light  technically it s still green and flashing be just a warning that it ll turn red the flashing you think you saw be probably the guy behind you flash you to drive faster or get out of the way  o  
speed camera be instal on traffic intersection  flashing green  you put your fut down and bang  500qr if you be lucky  i cross ramada signal on flash green at 2am do about 90km h  result 600qr and 4 point  be careful mate  
man  i swear it have just start blinking  and jorjetka  i rent a f ing seat ibiza  it take like 10 min to get from 0 to 80 so i be max 60 km h fast  hope u r both right and i get away with it  will keep u post 
it s very simple mate  if the light be green  flash green or even orange when you pass  you saw the camera flash  you be do over 80 kmph  check online in about 2 day  you ll know for sure either way  good luck  
how much be the relaxation in the speed limit set on the radarshere in qatar  as in dubai you can generally go 20km h over the displayed speed limit  sheikh zayed road be an exception where you can drive upto 160km h where a the speed limit be display at 120km h  waiting for your comment  
here 80 mean 80  no relaxation  
you guy be still lucky that you ppl drive your car  80km or sometime 100  120km  here in australia the maximum speed be 70km even in highway it not more then 80   which be such a bull s   
if you have smile to the camera  they will let u pay a 100qr only  but since u do not that must be serious  p 
speeding and crossing red light be two different thing pple  if you be at a right speed and only cross on flash green  it s fine  i ve do it so many time that if i be to get a fine  i d be out of business by now  o  
hey  checked on the website  nothing there yet  supposedly i must have be catch on monday  any chance i d still have a ticket after 4 day  
moving to qatar traffic signal camera flash  traffic signal at the sword junction i witness an unfortunate driver attempt to stop at red light have his front wheel just cross the sensor the camera flash instantaneously   but he stopped will he be penalized          
yes bt not 6000  only 600  
yes ofcourse  y not    he should have control his car bfore  
yes  ofcourse  if you have the reg  plate  number of the vehicle  you can check the following website www moi gov qa  traffic violation  
definitely 
he didnt violate the law      he do not proceed but stop may be his brake be weak so he drift a little forward to activate the camera      
i believe  no he wont be penalize at all  that s what i ve come to know from people who have go through the same situation themselves  
he will be penalize only the front as well a the back wheel cross the sensor  so do n t worry  
since camera ca n t see it number plate  so how will system know what s the number of car to book for fine  i think it s not possible to get penalise  
i think the camera might have flash for someone else who have cross the red signal completely which you do not notice  i be stay near the crazy and there be a lot of similar sudden break where most of the vehicle be sometimes cross their front wheel and i have not see any camera flash for them  i agree with the rule that he should have stop his car when he saw the blinking yellow signal  
no fine if he only cross and go through the junction to other end then he will be charge and will have to pay 6000  if he stop or he try to reverse back he wont be charge  happened with me twice in last 8months and i never get any fine to pay or any point  
qatar living lounge when be it consider jump the red light  if the red light turn red while in the middle of intersection  be it consider jump the red light  if you stop past the white line  be it consider jump the red light  my husband tell me that if you stop past the white line  even if you do not cross the intersection  the sensor will detect your car a beat the red light  is it true  thank you for your enlightenment  nina 
and why will you take risk  the cam only flash i u cross the line when there be red signal   img nid 21285 title desc link none align left width height 0  
nope  i m not take the risk and i wo n t ever do that  it s just that this morning  when i be about to cross the intersection  the green light start blink  instead of cross the intersevtion  i stop but i be past the white line already and i ca n t reverse anymore  i be worry  i be gon na be fin  
dont worry u ll b fine  its juz that u ve get to pay a sum of 6000 a fine   d cheer   
i have be flash twice at the toyota tower signals for jump the red light but luckily the camera be still in the testing phase  not all those ugly speed camera be fully operational  they havent all yet be connect to the ministry of interior s sever  once i be behind a truck at a signal and i couldnt see whether it be green or red when i be cross  these huge truck block the sight of the signal  they have to do something about it  anyways i would definitely advise people not to jump redlights and slow down at the singals  
you have 50 50 chance of get fine  but since you do not cross the intersection i be sure the authority will consider it and void your fine  syed qadeer 
wait with baited breath but fortunately no fine so far  
few intersection camera be still not active  syed qadeer 
if the green light be blink dont stop keep move but dont speedup too  the cam wont flash  the cam only flash when you cross red light   img nid 21285 title desc link none align left width height 0  
you guy forget the most important thing  make sure you smile at the camera while jumping the red lights 
do you think the new camera at muntaza signal  c ring  be already operate  my colleague tell me that in australia  if you stop past the white line  the camera will take photo and repeat it after a few second  if your car be tsill in the same position then you do n t get fin  i wonder if it s the same in qatar  
qatar living lounge crossing red signals on doha road why people be cross red signal on doha roads  i think signal be change quickly than on dubai road and it hard for the motorist to control their vehicle  moreover  motorist be bit panic fear the penalty a per the new traffic law  
this be a big problem which need to be address by authorities real soon   
its always a tension  scary 
dont cross red signal always cross green signal  and never trust the middle one it do get crazy some time   img nid 73057 title desc link none align left width height 0  
  lolo for me i get 6000 qr last week a violation due to this signal  
this people who cross on red signal be the most idi ts man i ever see  do they do n t have traffic signal way back in their country   or the car in their country run about 10km hr  mostly of them be same like u  expats  oooh  how i feel sad about this guy put their self in danger in a foreign soil  robin    get the batcar in the batcave    http  www qatarliving com user spanky1423 spanky1423 s picture 
i be look more at the traffic light than i be at the car in front of me   lol life s too short so make the most of it  you only live but once    
spicemom  same here  after i get a few speeding tickets  i concentrate more on the light now  the bad r near villagio  the green doesnt even blink  
they should have a timer show howmany second be leave  i have see it  that it start from some 30 or so and reduces to zero  so we will knwo exactly how much time be leave to cross or wait for the next 
also i traffic light here do not have standard option  some have blink green light  some chage to yellow right away then red  several time alredy i find my self driving in the middle of the crossing in red light luckily at the moment no fine  hehehe   pykester 
i do agree on the timer aspect  it would really help everyone so that they could adjust their speed accordindly  hope the official have knowledge on the timer thing and implement it soon   let wait and see  safe drive ppl    
welcome to qatar traffic lights omg  we receive two ticket from the traffic department  both because we didn   39  t wait the green light  now we have to pay 3000qr  be always that expensive      never ever again i will do it  even if i have to wait 10 minute in front of the red light without one car around me  why i didn   39  t know before about the camera on the light      
now you know what the colored light at intersection be for  you can always check your traffic violation at http  www e gov qa egovportal index jsp 
sorry  but that s really funny  please do n t tell which light it be a i really hope more people get do  that s the only way people will start to actually follow the road rule here  if they be enforced   
be it 3000 or 300   goashhhh  it be too much  and why u break the red light  grrrrr sandra r u fast and furious lol 
i be co pilot and i just remember one  i really throught that the light be not work  10 minute wait and nothing soooo i tell hubby just goooo and now we have to pay 3000 qr for both  be very expensive right    
so it you the root cause of ur hubby losing 3000 qr  i think i have to be very carefull while drive in doha or maybe watch light and go accord to traffic rule and dont listen to wife s opinion to jumb the light ha ha just kid sandra  so sandra be you scar of the light now    
not scar about the light doc  scar about the       we learn the lesson not more jumping   
sorry  double post  
actually u learn the easy way  not the hard way  
always look around  it s easy to see the cam next to signal  however  3000k be too much  you need to tell them to reduce that  they would accept  because you re a lady  speak with them within a nice way  they might reduce it to 500  becareful next time  
we always assume that obey traffic light be compulsory for expatriate but only advisory for national  always check both way before cross any junction   green light or not  
qatar living lounge driving in qatar is it just me or do anyone else who drive here end up a complete stressball because of all the reckless driver on the qatar road  do people actually take drive lesson here   seriously  i have never see a learner vehicle  between lane hopping  no indication and speeding  my blood pressure must be sky high   
as per your profile you be a member of ql for almost two year and it be strange that you be post about drive in qatar now  
i only start drive here in november  
the gulf  include qatar  be one of the last resort for drive like hell  anywhere else these people would be in jail  enjoy it while you can  in 20 year this will all be different  
few rule while drive in qatar  1st lane  speed limit 20  slow down when you see radar  2nd lane  speed limit   slow down when you see radar  3rd lane  speed limit 10 overtaking be allow from both side in some area  especially when police be not around  while near to roundabout  decide on which side you have to go  and then select the proper lane  
 mt  you will find driving school give their lesson in the area the company be situate in  they very seldom leave those area  hence the reason you probably have never see a   learner   driver  if you live near e ring  you will see gulf driving school car all over thumama and airport road  but never out of that area   
did u saw mercedes g55 drive on two wheel now that s crazyy 
if you need to drive and survive in qatar  then you need to be calm on the road  at the end no one be take the stress but you  that s how i ve be drive here since last 20 year   how you accomplish that be totally upto you  hopefully we can start a chain reaction with that and then it will really be pleasant for everyone on the road in our time   have a nice day   
mt  you need a lot of practice of move to right lane because vehicle behind you need to drive ahead   people need to reach some where  it be you who be cause delay by obstruct the smooth flow of traffic  
lol  mt  before i comment on the topic  i like to make a liiiiiiitelle correction here  the car in the pic you post have uae number plate  not qatari  no biggie anyway   yes  there be around 5  6 learning school here  may be you havent notice a learner vehicle coz they all be paint fancy  for the rest of questions  driving in qatar be more like an art of self defense  so always drive and stay safe    
 captain  i be just look to put a funny pic of crazy driving and come across this on good old google   molten metal what on earth be you on about  i have no clue what you mean  please explain       how do you know i need practice go in the r 
socialising my car accident with picture yesterday be drive  the guy infront of me stop at the green light for no reason and instead of hit him in the back directly i swerve to the right  and damage my car  if i hit him straight  the airbag would have open and damage me since i wasnt wear a seatbelt  any idea how much this would cost to fix  
next time wear a seat belt   
but admit you be not wear your seatbelt  lol  
ohhhhhh do any thing happen to you  any injury  yesterdat i visit a garage in industrial area 44  i also be hit from behind when i be in dubai  this workshop deal with lot of insurance company and it price be very reasonable  i be not make any advertisement for anyone  i even forget the name of the garage  however i have the guy tel  no and if you be interested i will give it to you  try to also check other workshop to compare between price quality time to finish the work  
be careful and wise in choose the garage most of them work for money only they even do n t know the meaning of quality  
plus do you get a police report to authorize repair  
flor  i be about to comment the same  lol  
yeah i get a police report to repair  the police say it my fault no matter what  even if the driver stop his car and be sleep at the green light it my fault  also  the thing be i have third party insurance  so i have to pay for my own insurance   anyone have an estimate of how much this will cost approximately  
no injury to anyone  thank god  but i think my neck hurt today    
and unfortunately your wallet will hurt tomorrow   
well be sure you re ok  car can easily be replace or repair but hope no unpleasant injury to you  as to the car  go to your insurance and check their accredited garage and from there  choose or if you have friend here who know industrial area  ask them  
qatar living lounge is there any camera on the roundabout  hi ql member  is there any camera in roundabout  when i m with my friend in the car  always see him beat the redlight on the roundabout  thanks 
normally there be no camera in the rond abouts  
your friend be a criminal  but  do n t worry  in qatar they can run around free  
thank you for the info  little bit worry for him a sometimes he do not notice that the red signal be on already but he still move  
then he might be blind  
not only be he break law and hence a criminal but he be also endanger his own life as well a the life of many people around include his friend travel with him  as for your question  then generally there be no fixed radar around roundabout but mobile one maybe plant every now ans then in which case your friend be doom  
lols lp  u mean color blind  
this be qatar  do you think people will stop at a red light when there be no red light camera  or drive at the speed limit when there be no speed camera  people here do n t seem to do anything because it s the right thing to do  but because they be afraid of punishment  
so your friend be the stupid driver i have encounter last time  i ll beat him next time  
no camera but their be police in plain cloth sometimes  
yr right t watch ppl wear seat belt and use of mobile phone

opportunities husband under wife sponsorship hello  i be wonder if it be possible for my husband to find get a job  with local hire  and stay under my sponsorship so he do not lose the benefit from my job  it do n t matter what sort of job he have  we just need the extra income  is this something he be able to do  i know the qatari law be always change  
take one rent a car  honda accord  toyota camry or chevrolet caprice  and run for a limousine service with any five star hotel colloboration u can easily earn up to qr  200 per day     
so he would use our own car  i be a little confused  we be already plan on buy a used kia from someone we know there  can he work for a limousine company and use their car  
 if he have an rp in qatar  he can work for the company stay under your sponsorship  if company agree  all he will need be a work permit  to work without a work permit be illegal   your question   is this something he be able to do    be rather to your husband  not to qlers is he

advice and help transfer of sponsorship my girlfriend and i have 2 different employer thus 2 different sponsor as well  we be get marry  can i cancel my fiance s present sponsorship and transfer under husband s sponsorship  does she have to leave the country  can she get noc from her present employer after the transfer  
get marry and get her under your sponsorship any time   img nid 73057 title desc link none align left width height 0  
darude  how about my other question  do she have to leave the country while the transfer be in process  the ultimate measure of a man be not where he stand in moment of comfort  but where he stand at time of challenge and controversy  martin luther king 
nope no need to leave the country   img nid 73057 title desc link none align left width height 0  
darude  may be you can answer my question  is it possible to change the wife sponsorship to husbands  without the consent of wifes presnt employer   i mean  wife want to resign the job against the wish of employer  and she want to be housewife under husband sponsorship  can the prsent employer of the wife play havoc  can he stop her do so    if he cancel her visa  whether she have to wait for two year  to come back to qatar under husbands sponsorship  this be not an hypothetical question  one of my friend really want to know  since she could not get an authentic answer  not able to resign  
yes u can do that  and she s gona have to leave the country for few day before come back to change her visa    god have create the man kind free  why do we enslave ourselves          only god can judge me         do n t mess with me unless you r ready to bleed    
to leave the the country i have see alot  second thing the small pvt company they dont wana lose any employee easily because they cant find a replacement and they be scar you might quit any time  then it the middle person say like hr who be the muff and screw everything   img nid 73057 title desc link none align left width height 0  
correct  just follow what darude s suggest  1  get marry  2  once hand the marriage document  let your wife to ask from his current sponsor to change sponsorship to husband sponsorship  u may do that instantly or upon expiry of you wife s visa  your wife can still continue with her current job without leave the country  3  ask for mandoub service to do the job  it be only a simple paperwork to change sponsorship  4  if your wife wish to quit the job  she may do so  so many reason to tell the previous sponsor for quit the job like she be pregnant  after give birth reason like she need to care for you infant   there be no substitute for victory yet there be risk of too much oversight   
   is it possible to change the wife sponsorship to husband  without the consent of wife s employer      she should have the noc   release no objection  from her current employer to transfer onto her husband  if present employer cancell her visa  she should exit the state and return on husband sponsorship within a week or anytime  no need to wait for 2 yr                                 a lady is a woman who makes a man behave like a gentleman   russell lynes  
hi there  thank you for these info  just one question  if my gf come back after marriage under my sponsorship without an noc and she want to work later somewhere here around in the middle east will she get in trouble because of the miss noc  thank you for your help 
produce atested marriage certificate to wife sponser and ask fr a release  here a darude say it be hr screw up  if she have ace to sponser ask her to meet the sponser and explain  definitely they will oblige and no chance of mess up  do not inform hr or mandoop if she be aproching sponser directly a 100  they will confuse and spoil entire broth  choul  yes definitely ur gf will be in trouble with out noc before 2 year 
moving to qatar can wife work hi all  since you guy be so good in answer all the question   more keep come to mind   just want to know if my wife want to work whether part time or full time  how hard would it be  would we need to go through my employer or would she need her own sponsor  bottom line  be it really difficult or not  thanks soooo much    
yes ur wife can work full time a per qatari law if she have a resident visa under ur sponsorship  she doesnt have to change sponsor in order to work  i hope this help 
depending on her field she should n t have a hard time find work  two thing  keep her under your sponsorship and know that local hire salary be generally low  mandi 
but make sure you have her paper sort out at the labour office  mean her sponsor  be yourself or your own sponsor  sign the official relase paper  because if she get catch without the legal authorisation you could be face a fine upto 25000 riyal  having say that  do n t be daunt the paperwork just take a day or two and be well worth your protection and that of her prospective employer  
oh  yes  forgot  if your wife want to work she will need to bring a police clearance from the us  mandi 
 one thing that have not yet be mention   the country be undergo a   qatarization   project  mean that they want local to have preference for job  i have several friend who have be offer job  only to have their work permit  for those specific job  deny  it can be a very frustrating process  particularly come from the u s  good luck    
hello friend  if she have proper qualification she can get a job easily  also i reckon she must be under ur sponsorship  so she do not need another sponsor to get a job  go through the newspaper and it be mention in many add  the applicant should be under husband father s sponsorship  good luck 
why not      
hi expat sueno if your friend after get the job offer never get their work visa from qatar govt  due to qatarization  project  then do this qatarization also affect the exist employee  whether they be also lay off after find a suitable qatari  regards anand 
sorry anand   i have no idea  i would hope not  but who know    
qatarization can affect everyone  this summer have a friend lose her job in the educational sector for this very reason  months later they be now try to get her back  she have 2 doctorate  several master in her field  a no one in qatar  or most place  would ever be able to match her qualification  most people  however  do n t get their job back  
moving to qatar personal loan and work termination i be currently work here in qatar  our employer inform u that they will transfer to contractor with less salary  but we have option not to accept  but the problem be i have personal loan in one of the bank here in doha  what if i will not accept the offer  what will happen to me  i mean do the bank will force to pay or not  
haha  so you want to get away without pay the loan  
not really  but iam just curious what if the company be the cause of termination  
yes  but your loan and contract be with the bank  
you mean even the cause of termination be the company  the bank will force me to pay   and wat if i find new job with less salary war will happen do they reduce my monthly fee  
i be sure you can renegotiate the repayment with the bank  
ah okay  because i be just worry  but not pay and run from my debt be not my option  i do believe in karma  thanks for the info  
you re welcome  i hope it all work out for you  
fact  if your company terminate you  take that letter to your bank  you wo n t be require to pay any remain amount  bank will use it tact  do n t yield  after few day of delay  finally you will get clearance from bank and fly home  insurer of your money  bank would pay that amount to bank  may be insurer and bank be have office in the same building  or manager be cousin  they be after your money  so escape clear from both party  pray hard  good luck in find another job soon somewhere  regards  
would you believe if i say 1000 have leave without repay a single coin in case your company terminate you  what for you pay premium every month my friend  
this be interesting  i do not know this  to be honest  i be surprised that this be possible  but good for those who have bank loan  
visas and permits transfer of sponsorship after 1 year  can i transfer my sponsorship after 1 year   need advise  please help me  
yes  but need noc 
need first the offer letter from other company then who will provide the transfer of sponsorship form  our company or the one who will hire me  
hello kabayan      what do i need to do first  find a job then get an offer letter or tell to my bos that i will find job then give me noc  and nbi clearance  where could i make this kabayan  thanks sa reply    
sponsorship change letter form from any type center you can get  it be call nakalat kafalat form  they will type for u and after that the rest procedure  
first ask your current company in general if they give noc  if yes then look for another job  if no then same company  do not ask directly the bos  ask some mandoob or any old staff inside about this 
hi  they dont have idea also if the company will give noc  they just tell me that our bos be good  and i think if there be some company will give me an offer letter which be high in my salary now  maybe they will give me  so i need to find first a job then tell to my bos then get a husband sponsorship form  
kinberly  husband sponsorship do not require noc  you can transfer anytime  provide that your husband s basic salary do not fall below 7000  you need to apply this in the labor department  i do n t know if process have change   with your husband s noc from company allow him to sponsor you  degree certificate attest by dfa  embassy and moi  6 month bank statement  labour contract and company id  
very rarely private company give an noc  5 in 100  now for example  if you look for a new job and then ask for an noc  ur bos will say no it be not our policy and he will doubt at u and will remove u from the company and then choice but ban for 2 year  in my case i get the noc first and then look for a job  now u mention they do not have an idea then u should check in a very political way with ur bos if they give noc  believe me go step by step  again i say check with ur bos first for an noc and then look for another job 
let me add one more thing  to change to ur husband sponsor the minimum requirement be qr 7000 a mention by coel and without this the labor will not approve it  for husband sponsorship u need noc from current company 
imtiaz  the only person require to produce noc be the husband  transfer of work to family visa does not require noc  it s the same a send your wife home and you apply for a resident visa under your name  no noc require  
visas and permits is there anyone here marry to a qatari  i be work b4 in qatar  i leave qatar last yr but be n t able to get noc from my company  my fiance be qatari but we re plan to get married outside qatar coz we do n t have the approval yet in qatar gov t  now  my problem be how be i goin to go back there with him  can he get me a family visa  thanks in advance  
dream 
why do he not move to your country  problem solve khallas  afterall you r marry him for love and not for come to qatar right  
me  no you cant unless you have approval you have to wait 1 year then he can sponsor you with his own visa  like company visa or kadama under his name so it easy for you to chance later if you get approval  
english only in the main forum  
even you get marry to any country to have to apply here  but make sure he be apply not only tell you or something you have to be wise my dear  he be marry  you will be he s second wife sorry to ask like this cuz this all count  and his family know about you  
uffff omg    hahahahah i dont know what to do to laugh or to cry   listen if u believe him that he will marry u i feel sorry for u  second thing why u leave the country and why he didnt help u to stay and solve ur problem about the noc  that mean he be not serious with u  today im not in a modd to fight so i deleted the rest of my comment  i will let her dream about marriage with a qatari ufff how can she believe him if he didnt even help her to stay in the country  a allah      
without government approval of your marriage  you wo n t get a family visa back into qatar  unfortunately  marrying you out of the country can cause major problem for your fiance  so i would suggest you wait until your marriage be approve  the only other option be that you relocate somewhere else  marry there  but your marriage will not be valid in qatar  and you will have no claim to any inheritences if god forbid  something should happen to him  does your fiance not have some wasta  that can obtain your release from your company  i be not say that will make thing any easy  since you still need to have the govt approval for marriage  but at least you can be in qatar  near him  
fil im sure she be just naiv  for sure he be married and his family will accept her   never believe me their pride be number 1  ufff i wish girl dont trust them so easily and dont beleieve them everything bhut what to do  
xena  maybe he not a true qatari only he be bear here like a lot of others that claim to be qataris  plus there be other issue will his family ever accept you the answer probably be no  
im sorry mr amyooo not all the same    they can get marry why not  im filipina marry to qatari for so many year i have approval my kid be qataries  if god will permit  no one can stop  and so many qataries be marry to filipina  sorry to tell you  
qatari culture can qatari girls allow marry indian     why arab girls not get marry indian man 
if the indian man be hindu  no  it s not allow  mandi 
so qatari female qler answer you that why they dont marry you  
give u some really knockout reason why we should  we re very picky so you ll have to be very persuasive                     
im go to be honest and blunt  i think it because most qatari woman dont find indian men very attractive  im just tell you what i think  im a qatari man and to be honest i dont care where your from it depend if i like you enough  
lol whitefeather  do n t go upset him now                      
                   
i mean no harm  p just type my thought  
 qatari lady  be never be allow to marry any foriegner even to any arab  so why wonder  qatari ladies be bear to marry gulf men only  but i know one  the father of the lady be half indian  and the father  arrange a marriage to her for an indian groom but i be not sure if the indian be allow by the government to stay here or even live here  the lady be qatari  her grandmother be an indian  but many qatari men be marry to an indian lady  i know alot    there s nothing we can do to change the past  if it teach you a lesson profit from it then  forget it     
if that the case  i wonder why the indian movie cinema hall be fill with qatari women  even men  if there be no liking for indian men or shall i say indian actors why be that most of the qatari women see first day first show of indian movies  the curiosity kill me  
be a god fear down to earth person  not be proud just wana share that i have be close to a few  its just that i be not a qatari or a muslim which they only find out after i tell them  or else i would have be marry to one by now  1 thing to appreciate qatari woman know how to respect their men  all other woman too know it  but see a lot in women here compare to their guy

he will not be able to marry this woman since he be married to you  he will not legally be able to live with this woman here and if find out he may be deport  maybe that s what you want  
my advice report him to the embassy here and also th authority  get him deported and tae him for all he s got  
this come a a total shock to me  because after last week s numerous posting  i think filipinos all love each other  be devote to the family and divorce be unheard of    
 lol  harry  i be think the same thing   i   it be dangerous to be sincere unless you be also stupid     george bernard shaw  1856 1950   
fight for the right of your kid  
do u still want him  
yeah fight for your right  you be still the legal wife   report your husband to the embassy   
i would reprot him to the athorities also  i do n t know the legality here  an irish colleague want to marry his canadian girlfriend  but his wife in ireland refuse to dvorce him  since he be move to canada anyway  they just get married locally without tell anyone that he be already wed  
opportunities why find a job in doha so hard  can somebody tell me how i get a good job in doha  i have an american passport and hold a husband visa  with a bachelor degree  speak 3 language  have a hard time to find a good job  i post my cv on many website include bayt com and many more  but do n t get any respond  thanks  
are you qatari  that may be the answer

not easy   unless you have a father s rp or marry to a man who have atleast 10  000r a month salary to be on his rp getting interview be easy with a nice modern key words cv that feature your accomplishment   getting a visa to work be the problem  i speak from 10 mo experience on this  best wish 
wasta my child  thats all it take  having american passport be of no use if job in your field can be fill with cheap hire  comprende  
also a tahsinmim said helps sometimes to hand over the cv directly  i think she s already on her husband s sponsorship a she mention that  
qdclover i guess you be not a qatari and you still have a job  so it s not always true  try visit the recruitment company in person  it help  
smoke  international govt semi govt company wont accept cv by hand  
yes i be on husband visa  and do n t want to transfer my visa to the company that s why i think it s hard for me to get a job  thanks to all  
no  not qatari but a good old aussie  they offer me a job before i come but it do annoy me people complain that they ca n t get a job in someone el country  is it easy for qataris to get job in the us  
kat yep very true about the type of work you be experience in  if the position can be fill local the mindset be  why hire a american that will want more salary then a different nationality  wasta  i have but lol kat i dont have the right wasta so im out of here  even with a catchy  professional cv it all come down to wrong visa  lol and they say be american with upon arrival visa be transferable   ya right   can u be my wasta  it be easy if you be on husband rp  just need patience a this be qatar they move slow in hr  but they get over 100  application a day  if your cv be eye catch and have what they need  you will get a call for interview

it quiet  but you can find thing to do if you really want to  now being happy will depend on a lot of thing  to be honest  are you single do you have a very active night life  etc  i do n t have a curfew i think that might depend upon what job you have and the requirement  active night life there be one but it limited  i see you be from the uk will be honest with you and say it nothing like the pub scene back there  clubs and pub be locate only in hotel  easy to get around if you drive but you have to be aggressive in your driving manner and defensive    i just like it here  for many many reason  but you do need to look at all the perspective before come here  one main one be that the riyal be peg to the dollar not the english pound  
i be here because my husband  he be my sponsor  i have work but i dont change my sponsorship  i can leave the company anytime i want and leave the country anytime i want  i have friend around keep me busy  i have solon to pamper my self  i go to nice restaurant when i miss home  i go to club when i want dance  i can find all i need here in doha  dubai be nice and big city then doha  sure the malls there get more to offer but so much traffic just to go one place to another  doha be well in my opinion for living  dubai only for shopping

either that or i m pretty simple lol i think i ll take positive attitude   actually  i m easily entertained and do n t believe in get bore because there s always something to do might not be what you have in mind tho  but look at the star on a clear night  go out with friend for coffee and laugh until you get silly  ok do n t take long   simple pleasures  i enjoy your sense of humor bc  you re a bit off the wall

first  you have to be 100  sure if you be preggy or not  go to the hospital a s a p so you can have a pregnancy blood test  better go early so you can wait for the result within 1 2 hour  they will ask you prior to that if you be marry the say yes  since you be really married right  2nd  does your employer know that your husband be in town or not  if they know that he be here  then leave it a it be  have you mention to your employer or interviewer before that you be marry  or have submit a marriage contract a part of the hr formality   then leave it again  then just go on with your pregnancy and do your best to invite your husband to come back in doha  further  make sure that you be live with your trusted friend or relative to avoid rumor  etc

jesse  what cornellian say be right  you have to either leave qatar before it too late or have to get married  normally these private clinic will not ask for a marriage certificate  but if by any chance u have to go to hamad  they will definetly ask for marriage certificate

actually i be n t really very clear in my message cuz i do n t think it be necessary to give a lot of detail  but now that u ask  the fact be i be not pregnant yet but i want to have another baby  however  i ve have back problem since my first pregnancy which be over 2 year ago  so my problem be do i try to fix my back first or go ahead and get pregnant which will probably cause more back problem then afterwards start treat my back  thanks for the phone number  i already have these  i be hop to get name of doctor people actually try  cuz my experience here have n t be so great  thanks  i appreciate your reply butterfly  
if you have an epidural during your pregnancy  then that may be the cause of your low back pain  regards 
are you serious  as a matter of fact yes i do have an epidural   i be n t aware that it could cause back pain for such a long time  thanks a lot for the info  i ll be sure to mention that to the doctor  once i find one   
dr amal badi be excellent  
a name at last     where can i find her  
hi ditto  amal badi  432 4349 all the best  
abt back pain  it s comman fof pregnant woman to have back pain  coz she be carry her baby weight too   so do n t worry it will disappear once u delived  if u still not comfortable with back ache  just have a nice warm bath or avoid wear high heel shoe  o k have a nice day  
i suggest you go to ask in another site  www expatwoman com  the lady can help you  
hello ditto  i do think you need to see a chiropractor  and if you do have back pain of course it mean there be something wrong with your back  since you be pregnant your pelvis be expand which cause pain in your lumbar and pelvic also due to the extra weight  therefore the best treatment for you be chiropractic  it not only for your back pain but also for optimum health of the baby and you the chiropractic approach to good health be to detect  reduce  and help pervent nervous system dysfunction  
family life in qatar pregnancy and childbirth in qatar we be new here and have find out we be expect a baby later this year  where be the best place to deliver  any recommendation on doctor  
ahli hospital 
experience and caring  
best place for childbirth be hamad women hospital they be care  helpful  clean  
hamad hospital be the best  ahli and others be just expensive     
hamad hospital it s a government hospital  after make health card every visit and testing be free doctors be also good for medicine they take only 5 or 10 rial for child birth only they take 100 or 200 rial only so go to hamad 
i hear a lot of good thing about hamad hospital  i also hear a lot of good thing about a certain german doctor at al ahli  my wife and i be plan to have a baby next year and we could also use some advice base on actual experience  
sunshine  would recommend hamad  women s hospital  they really take good care of pregnant woman  my wife just complete first trimester  she go for her regular check up s with pre determined appointment in hamad and say the treatment be incredible  
it s well equip  have world class reputation and facility be available free of charge   
thank you  can the husband be in the delivery room in hamad  ultimately  i prefer the best care and doctor  though  are the delivery recovery room private in hamad  felix  do you know the early they saw your wife for her first appointment  we just find out  but would like to find a doctor and get a checkup soon  
no  they dont allow husband in the delivery room  
family life in qatar giving birth in al ahli hospital hello  i m 4 month pregnant and i have be see dr  najla at al ahli hospital  i plan to give birth there and i really aprecciate some consideration from woman who have deliver there  how be the deliver  it be normal labour or c section  are the nurse well prepared to take care of the baby   please  any information will be very important  thanks 
please consider hamad medical hospital  they be much more experienced and prepared  
al ahli be the best hospital in doha  
my friend have a beautiful baby girl yesterday morning at al ahli and she be very well take care of  
al ahli be the best  ofcourse the charge be little high  you will be charge something between 15  000  20  000 for a 3 day stay in c section  the staff be well experience with good behaviour  nothing to worry  good luck  
please consider another hospital  they be not experience and be not capable nor have any facility to take care of your baby  if there be any complication  i will pm you further detail  since i have to leave now  many serious incident have occur there over the past week and as much a 5 6 baby have have to be rush to hamad hospital because of gross medical negligence on the part of al ahli hospital  i personally know of 1 baby who be still in the ncu of hamad hospital now  that have to be transfer from al ahli  stay far away from al ahli hospital and consider hamad hospital  do you want to go to al ahli because u have the money or because u really care for your baby  
scorpio79  your last comment be uncalled for  are your fact correct  do you mean there be no nicu so ill baby have to be transfer to hmc  
same go for doha clinic  if anything go wrong  tha ambulance s be rush to hamad medical  why risk it  i know a girl that give birth at al ahli and the doctor stiched her up that she later could n t have sex with her husband  she have to go through a minor surgery to correct the mistake  please have faith in hamad medical  
thanks you all for the response  althought i must say that i ve be quite worry about some comment  are you people sure about those thing  that a ahli do n t have nicu    did you actually give birth on hamad or other hospital to say that or this be like that kind of stuff that you hear somebody say and reapeat a if be realy truth   i m ask because chosing a hospital doctor far away from your home country be a very dificult decision  and al ahli hospital do n t look like the kind of place you describe  i like to hear from someone who actually deliver there  is there anyone   thanks 
her first three be at hamad medical and her last child be bear in al ahli only because she want her husband to attend the delivery  she compare all four delivery and decide never to go back to al ahli  they be rude and break her water  without her approval  she be emotionally and phsycologically abuse by the nurse there  they would n t call her doctor when she be ask them to  we have to call her from our personal mobile  not a very pleasant experience  i m have all my child at hamad medical  
some of my friend wife deliver a baby in hamad  and im pretty sure it good  although the husband cant go inside the labor room  but all of them have be take care of

qatar living lounge filippancy at al ahli hospital i have an appointment at al ahli dermatology department schedule for 1 20 pm today  as i arrive on time  i be tell to wait for half an hour a the doctor leave for his lunch break  without care about his patient  i cancel the appointment and leave the hospital  is it a fair treatment  your comment please  
sadly doctors here feel that they be far too superior to care about patient  
do u think cancel appointmnt be the solution  u should have to complain  which u do not  
specially consider the kind of money we pay over there for consultancy  but not something unheard of never have such an experience at al ahli though i ve go through similar situation elsewhere whilst i applaud you for stand your ground  know me though i d probably have wait depend on my queue wait number  
this be common problem a this hospital  i have hear of people wait more than 1 hour for scheduled appointment  scheduling the appointment be often difficult and disorganize also  hopefully if enough complain they will improve  but best solution be for new private hospital to open to create competition  
doctor leave  maybe he just leave for he attend a patient before you  better he be not hungry while treat you rather than  you know  anyhow  set another appointment and if it be still the same  complain  do n t just go  
i have fill suggestion form and put in the box before leave al ahli  i be consider to visit hamad hospital instead  good to have choice  
doctors in hospital here go for lunch break  prayer break etc  and since that be the case  maybe the best solution would be to schedule patient accordingly   mind you  long wait time be normal for doctor s visit the world over  
 did you not ask for the doctor s schedule for that day  maybe your definition of   appointment   be contacting asking information desk whether this that doctor have clinic today without ask his her exact schedule  well  most of the doctor here be incompetent for their title and most of the time would cause more trouble to you   
sorry can you explain the title  
please let u know  if al ahli respond back to your suggestion form  because my experience be that they have a lousy customer service and be not interested in follow up on the complaint  do remember that all unit of hamad hospital do not have a strict appointment system  you just go there early and take the token and wait for your turn  it can take half and hour to almost an hour and half to see the doctor

hi i be an accounting graduate with 9 year experience in my field and be look for a job in doha  thanks 
try hotel like marriott  ritz carlton  sheraton  etc  bayt com be also good  you can also check the web site for the newspaper  like www gulf times com and check their ad section  sometimes the recruiting agency be also advertise in that newspaper  so you can take some name from there as well  good luck  if you re look for a problem  you re probably gon na find one  
i be not sure on what condition you be go to move to doha  but it look like both of you guy do n t have a job in qatar  so actually you have to star from search job  as have be mention  try to browse internet for the advertismenets  then you can get phone fax number and e mail of particular hotel  and send your cvs directly to these hotel  when you find the job  the comapany will issue visa for you  and only after that you can come to qatar  good luck   this too shall pass    img nid 71431 title magic ring desc link none align left width height 0

family life in qatar parkhouse school  review hiya  does anyone have any kid in parkhouse school that could give me a real good insight with regard to the teaching standard  etc please  would the kid fit back into the uk system if they be to go back to uk   sometime  lol  any other comment appreciate  thanks  
shityouno  your name say what you be  shityuono  
now that be funny  the user s name be sh tyuono and she can post wildly on ql  when i mention her name it be remove by the mod  wake up guy    
block that  mod remove  yuono  or you make yourself a laugh clown  mod  
a number of my tuition student be from parkhouse  there seem to be little support for those who lag behind in a particular subject  also the number of uk qualify teacher with qts  qualified teacher status  be limited  you may wish to ask how many of the teacher actually have qts compare to those that do n t  many of the teacher be not from the uk and do so not have a background of teach a british curriculum  finally  parkhouse only follow part of the national curriculum of england and wales  the rest of the curriculum be base around what be refer to a the international curriculum  which be create by a private company in the uk and be not endorse by the government  this topic have be discuss a number of time previously so you may wish to do a search to get a good idea of the school  you may also wish to try other uk curriculum school such a doha college  dess  sherborne and the international school of london  good luck  
joe90 not sure how qualify you be to comment on the status of the teacher at park house school  all their teacher comply with sec condition on qualification of their teacher  otherwise they would not be able to operate  i can confirm the vast majority of teacher at the school be british  2nd be south african  excellent standard of educated teacher  and other nationality  the school be as british a it get in a non british country  the standard be extremely high  there be very positive school parent contact and all pupil be expect to work hard  be well discipline  and result focused  i be british and my child attend park house  i would have no problem with them return to the uk  not likely with the current working condition in the uk   and slip into very good school and cop with the change  if you be typical middle class parent who discipline your child and make sure they stay on top of their study you will reap the benefit of this school which   
as a user of the qatari and british education system for my child let me tell you that if you have a good teacher  your child and you be lucky  usually here about 1 in 5 teacher have that power to inspire your child  be glad when you get one  no matter what school they be pay by  education be about inspire child to progress  not about check off what they have study  
craftyqueen  let me tell you that all the child who be not as good in read a the rest of their colleague be take away from their normal class  give to a volunteer parent  who be give a bunch of flashcard with no further instruction  who be suppose to help them develop read skill  not only be that wrong  but on top of it they miss what be happen in their class  and do n t try and tell me it s not true  i be a volunteer parent last schoolyear for year 1  is this the way to save on spending more time with the child who need more reading practice  why not do like the french school  extra hour of tuition after school  last swimming competition the kid be so excited to show what they could do  instead the swimming teacher use her own son to get a good place for park house  the amount of dissapointed face of child be heartbreaking  waiting hour for nothing  things be far less positive then what you make them seem  
alumnar i be surprise you be willing to say negative comment about the school your child attend on ql  maybe you should change school for your kid and give those parent who would remove their right arm to put their kid into park house their place  in the uk all primary school ask parent to come into the low primary class to hear the child read  i ca n t understand what could be good than one to one reading  if you want to suggest a reading group after school which parent fund i be sure the school would be interested in your suggestion  in the uk book be change once a week  here in park house it three time a week  their book be set base on their individual ability into small group if possible  the teacher hear the pupil read at least once a week  parents be ask to participate in their child s learning by listen to their child read at home  schooling be not a vacuum  a child can learn at anytime anywhere  as for fairness  the world be not fair and   
 some of the comment that have be make on this thread be more than a little misleading  for example  be we compare parkhouse  or any other school in doha  with fee paying  independent school in the uk or be we try to compare them with state school in britain  as parkhouse be a fee paying school  i would have think that the former would be a fair point of comparison  one person have write that the standard at parkhouse be   extremely high    well  if there be an acute shortage of school place  then it stand to reason that some of the more popular school can be very selective about who they allow in through the gate  i have not hear much about parkhouse s special educational needs policy and i suspect that they would not want to admit sen child because that might affect their   extremely high standard    that also might explain parkhouse s preference for nice  white english child  craftyqueen have mention the sec  the supreme council of education  this be a    
dear all  some comment be positive  some be negative this be in 2010  now we be in 2012  ccould anyone update his point of view  or share his kid experience a a parent   because i m about to put my two kid there  thanks   
moving to qatar birla pubic schoolv s doha modern indian school dear ql member  good morning   i have just move in from dubai and want to admit my child for grade 4 under cbse syllabus  am not sure if birla be good or doha modern indian school   would be grateful if u member  with your kid in either school give me fee back on this  and the admission be easily do  i hope   thanks for ur response in advance  
school bashing be on now  img nid 73057 title desc link none align left width height 0  
hi darude no   this be not bash  i be just interested in get the best for my child  be not sure if doha modern be good with it high fee structure or birla be  hence this topic  my family will be join me in two week time and need to make a decision  thanks 
i be tell u that m e s indian school be good and i be a xiith grade student there  
hi ajnas  thanks for your feedback  will contact the school staff and check for admission  how be the seat availability scenario  
m e s be the bad  birla be the best this be what people say in doha  d  
that be only the problem 
no need to worry for seat even if seat be not available they will accomodate 1 coz there will be minimum of 80 student in a class he hehehe 
but if u compare the mark and other activity of student me will be the top in the gulf 
max  42 class 
i be get confuse now this response be what i have be get from few acquaintance here in my short stay  are they give extra activity coach too at birla   
salary and allowances teacher assistant  should i accept  i receive a job offer of assistant teacher in a nursery  we propose me to live in a shared room in a villa with the other nursery personal and the lunch be pay by the company  transportation frim home to work be also pay by the company  the month wage  1100  per month  i be a french girl and i have a bachelor degree in english and arabic language  what do you think about that  
insist on a separate accommodation  
i try to negociate with them but there be no way to change anything  
then forget it   
it be a very low offer  4k qr   try to find another job  
agree with lp   1100 per month be qr 4  000  which be very low consider you have a degree in english and arabic  im sure you can get way good offer than this  
you can consider the offer  it be not bad but how about your job there  do you receive a good salary  
actually i really want to move to qatar  do you think that if i accept this offer  i could have a good opportunitie to find an other one when i will be in doha   
u realize there be an annual contract and sponsorship rule and all that  u shouldnt come to qatar with the purpose of change employer anytime soon take ur time measure ur option and make a decision still 4000 qr be nothing actually receptionists get this salary with no degree at all 
it mean that if i accept the offer i wo n t be able to break the contract before it end   
considering that while in qatar  you might have to get a no objection certificate from your present employer in qatar to move over to any good offer  a villa might sound to be big  but  how many be to share the villa  and who be pay for your air travel  shared accomodation  share food  share communication expense  share expense over sightseeing or go out  hmmph  while everyone be entitle to his her own view  my view be that your package be a tad low and you have to really think through to save something  cheers

thanks for your opinion  i can speak hindi  english and telugu and can understand malayalam as well  please let me know any good website where i can learn arabic language  
you would not have much problem here if you could speak english  hindi  some qataris could undestand english as well a hindi  
some qataries understand malayalam also  2 day back my friend meet his company sponsor first time  he be a sheikh and start talk in broken malayalam  my friend reply in english and the sheikh shout at him and say talk in your language   
do n t hate me diamondgirl  this certainly do not apply to everyone  but my personal experience here in doha be that most do not speak english  even people who be not local and come from the subcontinent and claim to speak english do not understand you or prove able to articulate their thought in english  i m not try to upset anyone  but i m call it like i see it  this be a true story  i call the information number provide on the qatar foundation website to get some information on the american university you hear so much hype about  and be shunt through 4 different people who could not speak english  this be n t an obscure gvt office in the ministry of islamic study or whatever  this be qatar foundation   so  no  english be not a main language in qatar  and be mostly speak by the european and north american expat communities only  stay safe all  perfection do not exist  the question therefore  be  what level of imperfection be we willing to settle for

what if     eye contact lead an spark to your heart   
moving to qatar personal loan and work termination i be currently work here in qatar  our employer inform u that they will transfer to contractor with less salary  but we have option not to accept  but the problem be i have personal loan in one of the bank here in doha  what if i will not accept the offer  what will happen to me  i mean do the bank will force to pay or not  
haha  so you want to get away without pay the loan  
not really  but iam just curious what if the company be the cause of termination  
yes  but your loan and contract be with the bank  
you mean even the cause of termination be the company  the bank will force me to pay   and wat if i find new job with less salary war will happen do they reduce my monthly fee  
i be sure you can renegotiate the repayment with the bank  
ah okay  because i be just worry  but not pay and run from my debt be not my option  i do believe in karma  thanks for the info  
you re welcome  i hope it all work out for you  
fact  if your company terminate you  take that letter to your bank  you wo n t be require to pay any remain amount  bank will use it tact  do n t yield  after few day of delay  finally you will get clearance from bank and fly home  insurer of your money  bank would pay that amount to bank  may be insurer and bank be have office in the same building  or manager be cousin  they be after your money  so escape clear from both party  pray hard  good luck in find another job soon somewhere  regards  
would you believe if i say 1000 have leave without repay a single coin in case your company terminate you  what for you pay premium every month my friend  
this be interesting  i do not know this  to be honest  i be surprised that this be possible  but good for those who have bank loan  
visas and permits medical examination info  hi all  i finish my medical exam here in doha  i would like to know besides hiv and tb  be there any other disease check in the medical examination  im only interest in the disease that will make me fail the exam  and how many day or week will the result will be available  thanks 
sif you work in the admin job then u only need to check hiv and ptb result after 3 working day  if you work a a medical  paramedical or any food handler job  you also need to check hepab and hepac   
im an i t  guy so guess i dont have to worry about hepa  what about other std disease  do they check those  
but try to be clear from all these before come here  welcome to qatar  
is the medical exam result always take 3 work day  beacuse my colleague do the fingerprinting 2 week after his medical exam and he say the medical exam result take 2 week  and the only thing for him to know if he pass the medical exam be because he do the fingerprinting process  and be there anyway to know if you pass the medical exam  
once you be do w  ur medical exam you can check w  the medical commission at least after 3 working day  just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you ll get to know if it ready or not  for a medical employee it usually take about 2 wks to have the result do due to other test  e i  creatinine test  that have to be send to hmc for investigation  in your case  you be only require to undergo blood test  hiv   chest x ray  ptb   so i think it wont take long that much  dont you have mandoop representative for your company  he be suppose to follow up all these thing and you can always check w  him  good luck  
thanks apple for always reply on my post  another thing  after medical will i immediately go for fingerprinting or it will be for another week or so  
yes  you can do the fingerprint immediately  so  just relax everything will be ok   
everyone be check for hepatitis c  not just those in medical or food business  after the medical your sponsor be alert via sm about the result  pass fail  assuming all be good next be fingerprint and after that your residence permit can be process  
so if it s find positive do can one obtain iqama  
no  any positive in any of the 3 test and you re denied residency and send back whence you come  
working in qatar what if staff do n t sign warning letter  what happen if a sponsor employee refuse to sign a justified warning letter  what can the sponsor employer do  ps  no time waters  response from uneducated ql member please  
i would say they would be in a lot of trouble  but then i m uneducated so that probably be n t the right answer   
if the sponsor employee do n t sign the warn paper we can not do anything  just leave him  
 wxyz  azut 1sztv  qwerty  is this an educate answer  am i   waters    your time   
3 thing can be do  1  ask him to write a letter in disagreement to the warning to explain his version of why he shouldnt be issue a warning letter  the warning letter still sustain a 1st warning and be file into his p file  2  suspension  the employee can be suspend from day to week  depend on hr policy  3  immediate termination  if the warning be base on safety issue  and the employee refuse to acknowledge the issue  then termination can be in effect a a last resort  
it do n t matter  the warning still stand  
anything up to and include termination  mandi 
that warn letter will be keep on the concerned employee s file  the company s hr will indicate the date when the letter be serve and write a notation on the letter say that the concerned employee refuse to receive it  i hope though that the write warning be be serve in accordance with the company s rule and regulation and all employee be aware that such exists  
even if your tear that letter still your out of your chair and go home from where you come from

india embassy at it best when it come to bureaucracy and red tape no other can take this top spot i would rather have one rise and a kind word from a friend while i m here than a whole truck load when i m go 
it s it s the egyptian embassy  just few month back  they threaten the egyptian living in doha about be legally sue and track if they talk about egypt in public forum  this be announce in qatar daily newspaper  
tcom     that must be a left over from the british rule 
why blame the british for everything  a it be we be expert at blame game i would rather have one rise and a kind word from a friend while i m here than a whole truck load when i m go 
the bad  for me  be the british embassy  i m a brtitish citizen  but my best friend s wife be try to join him for a week in the uk a he s leave for work  the embassy staff ask her to renew her passport because her country come out with a new one  she get the new passport go back they laugh at her and say  come back on sunday when she go back  they simply tell her we re not give you a visa  not fair  the poor thing really want to go see her inlaws she never meet them  sad 
 its not only the way indian embassy work  the house keep be typical indian and qatar govt  also must be well aware of the indian ness or else what can you say about the approach roads to indian embassy  when ever i get home sick   i just go around the embassy and i be in real india       they walk among u  they vote  they even reproduce       
i would not knock the embassy on a forum either  t say why blame the british for who blame them   all embassies be full of red tape and paper work  and every piece of paper cost money lol  not even death be free because it cost your life  
visas and permits how do i get my girlfriend into qatar  hi everyone  i m currently negotiate a position  i have be tell they will only include my partner in the package if we be marry   this be n t an option at this stage  i would like her to have the option to be able to live with me in doha  whether it permanent or not be another issue  any advice on how i can make this happen  appreciate all your help  
i be in a similar condition in 1990  i marry my girlfriend and the problem disappear  it s that easy  
even if you can bring her you still can not stay together it illegal here  and the only solution be marry her  but you have say it s far from your plan  you just can help her to find a job here and come and just see each other during your free time  but not live together  
so it illegal for guy and girl to live together  surely not  i guess the greter issue be that my place of work wo n t be able to add my girlf a a dependant to my sponsorship  does anyone know for how long i can get her a visa for qatar  eg if she fly in out a a tourist  
find her a job here  it s the only option if you re not yet ready to get married mate   you guy can live together  yes it s illegal but if the authority be to arrest  deport every unmarried couple live together in qatar  suffice to say there would be a significant drop in the work population of qatar  hope this help  i feel for you mate  
here  it be not allowed  best be careful  some people here  if they know unmarried couple who live together  they rat them out to the police  
 just marry her    there be so many rumor about me  feel free to believe in any of em     
 junarc2003  it s a question of a lifetime commitment    just marry her       like   just go to the corner shop  pick one up eh       and when you re do with it  go get another one i suppose     c mon mate  there s more to it than   just   when it come to one s life partner or at least there should be  ers 6  do n t bother with the   oohh it s illegal you ll get arrest   brigade  loads of young couple in qatar be unmarried  the people around them  neighbours include  think they be  only their close friend know they re not  yes they do live happily  ever after sometimes     
gadarene  do you know that there be something call d i v o r c e   
yes i do magicdragon  your point be   
 bottom line be it illegal  and we be not here to give illegal advice  two unmarried people can live together  but here his issue be about put her under the   dependent   tag which i dont think he can do if shes just his girlfriend  simply put you cant have the cake and eat it too  good fortune always come knock at your door  when you be sh tting in the toilet         smoke      
socialising most beatiful girl in the world   which part of the world have most beautiful girl  i heard somewhere lebanese and egyptians be most beautiful   be it true   
 no such thing a   most beautiful girl    each country have it fair share  britain more than most ofcourse   
of helen of troy  
probably world will witness most beautiful girl from the qatar adn other middle east country  if they come out of burqa  dev  everything desirable  is either expensive  banned  illogical or seeing  married to  someone else      
beauty lie in the eye of the holder   
how about russians    they be also consider one of the most beautiful  dev  everything desirable  is either expensive  banned  illogical or seeing  married to  someone else      
if we be talk about physical beauty  i say  people with mixed bloodline  they hold the beauty of each race country  dev  off the burqa  have n t see much beauty in qatar  syrian and saudi yes  i can attest to that  but then again  physical beauty be skin deep  it too will become wrinkly  hence the cliche above  
and france   natural beauty   beauty be in the eye of the beholder  hope u get one  dev  i feel u r look for makeup box not girls  
well say bubbly  after all it nature of the person which count  beauty be just for the first impression  till u open ur mouth  lols  dev  everything desirable  is either expensive  banned  illogical or seeing  married to  someone else      
well fr me  i too heard the same thing dat egyptians woman r d prettiest   ofcourse arab race in general r beautiful if they sacrifice their make up kit  they r naturally pretty so arab grls plz frget those 4hour long make up u do befre even go to d nearby grocery  allah have make u guy in d best of d best form  try appreciate it say alhumdulilah atleast one daily

socialising qatari men and western women ok guy i be go to prehaps tick someone off again but i have a question  not sunny but me  will a qatari man go out with a western christian girl  have sex with her and then move on because he think woman from the west be wild and sex crave  sunny have receive quite a bit response from qatari men who want to date her once we arrive  i even get an offer myself  but i believe it be a trap and i tell sunny be careful  any advice out there  
it be a very rare qatari man that would want anything more than what you just describe  it be a very rare man in qatar that want anything more to do with a western girl than you just describe  meeting men here be like step through a minefield  9 out of 10 of them just want sex  and they will do and say anything to get it from you  i be not bitter  i do not hate men  but i have be live in various part of asia for the last 2 and a half year  trust me when i say if you do not want to get burn be very careful who you date  asian opinion of western woman be not very high when it come to sex and dating  tell sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first  
if you be not look for a long time relationship  go for it  when it come to a question of sex  nationality  religion do not matter  that be my humble opinion  angelo 
i must tell you redcajun504 arab youth can go to any extent to get sex  but so be men from any country  men have always sex on mind  it be always advisable to be cautious  but why be you worry  there be a huge expat population here  which include indians  europeans  americans and even australians  so  it s not a problem basically  ask sunny to be prudent and approach the thing casually  without any pre conceived notion  though caution be utmost require  you never know you may actually get a gem of person among these arabians  after all  many of them have marry westerners  but dohagirl a such be correct that youth here always look for sex  on my own experience i must tell you they see russians  lebanese and filipinos a someone always available for sex  actually  this part of the world have many prostitute from these community  throng star hotel  use your common sense and thing will be cozy for you  i wish you and your sister best of luck  ambrish  ambarishjha  gmai   
life be not easy if you be a western woman  and the main reason a man from this part of the world would want a western woman be mainly for sex  however  please do not for one moment think that the men and woman here co n t have premarital relationship  they do it just not talk about and it be not caried out in the open  due to the conservative background of the boy they will always return to their family and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the family would not be happy about it  i think it be much good to be very cautious out here although there be a great many handsome men and they can be very charm go through the arab and asian world of men they be all interested in sex  one of the thing be that be find to be together whoc ae not marry can get into very deep trouble here  just a little food for thought  
sadly this have be the case for many year  maybe it originally stem from the day when arab have load of money  visit capital city  mainly in the west  and be naturally surround  a they be rich  by hooker  word spread when they return that they have be with western woman  the assumption would then be make that all western woman be loose  that be the assumption that we come to many year ago  rather like the western men go to thailand 
thanks dweller you have be fair  dg your point be sensible i tried to see if the shoe fit on the other foot and it same ironical    lol   it be a very rare western man that would want anything more than what you just describe  it be a very rare man in the west that want anything more to do with a asian girl than you just describe  its impossible to believe that the thousand of cripple shake 70 year old western men move with 21 year old asian beauty do so  because the guy be so romantic  love and responsible that the girl fell head over heals in love with him  i have see western men in various part of asia for the last 2 and a half year  trust me when i say if you do not want to get burn be very careful who you date  western opinion of asian woman be not very high when it come to sex and dating  here i actually mean woman from china  phillipines and thailand easy prey for western men in other country south asia and middle east woman be not availabl

politics russia deploy nuke to south ossetia russia deploy nuke to south ossetia http  freeandindependent wordpress com 2008 08 11 russians move 2 ss 21 medium range ballistic missile launchers into south ossetia  now for the drum roll u s   military  to take control of georgian port  saakashvili http  www reuters com article politicsnews idusld49893320080813  feedtype rss  feedname politicsnews yeaaaa somehow this do n t seem like a good idea  
your right there abu american  russia with nuclear missile and bush use his force in place best leave alone  scary stuff methinx   
the georgian president will ensure that russia trreads carefully in case usa soldier be catch in the firing line  as per most of yesterday s paper  it be already check mate  georgia have to grovel to the russians and accept a one side peace deal  
i hate to be the paranoid type and i be sure i be wrong but i keep get this nag feeling we be head towards a new world war  seems like the last few year we have see a lot more action go on globally  yea brandy scary stuff indeed  
nothing will happen  i think these be only pressure tactics  by both side 
 firstly  why do you name your offspring   american     secondly  the optimist would suggest that by the action the russians have draw the line and the americans will now think twice about interference in other region where russia may have a presence  the pessimist would suggest that after this bloody nose  the yank may up the ante in the gulf by initiate some sort of action against iran  i be side with the optimist for now   
 yes  i think the yanks have learn not to   bait the bear   so to speak from this endeavour  and we ve get 4 month leave before bush be out  so unless mccain get in  which be likely  then we just need to wait out these 4 month and hope this and the current situation in iraq be enough to keep the us in it s place  visit www qatarhappening com  
heh play on word brit  none of my offspring have american name

socialising need help with torrent so i get qtel fiber yesterday instal  now how can i fix it  so the port arent block when i be download movie use bit torrent or some other torrent program     please help  the speed test give me 50 mb  but on torrent im only get 105kb    
try hotspot shield 
yeah i know hotspot shield  but there be a limit on the speed with hotspot shield    
the speed be also dependent on the number of seed and the number of leach  you could have 100mbs but if 105kbs be all that be available for a torrent that s all you be go to get  
is this only a fibre problem  i have no issue on the normal dsl  
someone send me a message and recommend vpn4all what do that do  well when browse on the net or use speedtest qa  im get 50mb  but when i be use the program torrent it say port block  u have to use a port to download  and it blocked 
 vpn or proxy service provide a dedicated encrypted private link to a server somewhere else in the world  then you connect via the vpn server to the internet  they charge a monthly fee and there be many to choose from  some give option of which country to connect to  this help where online service only work if you be   in   the relevant country  i e  so bbc online tv think you be in uk   
adza  do that help when use it to download torrent with torrent program  
does that affect the speed that you have with qtel  if i have 50mb and i connect to another server will i go down to 1mb  i dont understand 
 dw  not sure if it will affect your speed or not  depends on too many thing along the   pipe   it guess  it could help the port issue  but a i say earlier i have no issue with utorrent on the normal dsl so have not move to fibre yet  it definitely help with the   wave finger   on blocked website  you can try one of the vpns for a month  i think price be around  10  i use www overplay net a while ago  it be easy to pay with paypal  and then stop the subscription via paypal   
if you want to unblock the port i can tell you how to do it

doha shopping computer softwares hey  we all know where to get the pirated dvd s and cd s in doha  anyone know where to get the pirated pc softwares  like windows vista  office 2007  etc  
this be not the place to be ask such stupid question  and if you do n t know whee to get it then you should n t have it 
sorry but be curious  
ok so where do you you get the dvd and cd  
behind sofitel or ffc at airport signal  
it s good if you use original software only  good for you  your pc  and after all for the company who spend million in research to creat a software for you  however  if you be still hook on pirate  there be a beter option to download from free download server  just type software name  torrent in search box and you will get what you be look for  lol  img nid 54059 title desc link none align right width 440 height 43  
how much do it cost for 1 dvd there   
in qatar  it vary and depend on the software   on torrent site  it s absolutely free and sometimes you get a good print a be the dvd   img nid 54691 title desc  wherever you live  live everywhere  link none align centre width height 0  
download and install frostwire  www frostwire com  then you ll be able to find many mp3s  movie  software  book  etc that you ve be look for  else  you can drop by this dvd shop at souq asiri  front thailand resto   this how it work  first you browse through their movie catalog  get the catalog number  this indian guy will hand you the bootleg for qr 12 15 each dvd  for software  go to sofitel pc store at the 2nd floor  but bring an indian guy with you to sweet talk their fellow indian coz they wo n t sell you anything unless you re from mumbai or somethin  you see  the indian be the king of piracy here in doha

computers and internet what be the fast way to download free movie from the web  q208 
 torrents  use   utorrent   a your torrent client  use something like   www mininova org   or any other website that have load of torrent on it  it be not the fast way sometimes  but the most guaranteed free one  good luck   
 king be right  utorrent  www utorrent com  be the best and simple torrent client  once download you just need to install it and then use the search engine on the top right hand side of the interface to search for whatever you want to download  i e just type the name of the movie   it will take you the mininova org and once there it be a good idea to sort the findigs by click on the heading seeds  this will sort it so the movie or program with the high number of seeder will show first  this guarantee you a high speed a   high number of seeder  great speed    hope this help  other good site be  demonoid com torrentz com torrent to but the one i use for movie be  www torrentfive com  
and of course  it depend on your adsl speed provide by qtel  the fastest adsl speed for home use available be 2 mbps  which mean you can download up to 256 kb per second a a maximum when your line be idle  check my page here  i make a small table list the three different adsl speed provide by qtel for home use  http  ilovesarah us  scroll to bottom to see table  
 dude  there be no such thing a   free movie    what you be referee to a   free movie download   be in fact the illegal download of copyrighted movie  well know a piracy  fyi  piracy be a crime punishable by law  thus  the fast way to acquire movie be to buy them   
oh come on pal  every one download movie from net so chill dude  use ares program to download fast and free movie  
agree to pal  if u want faster  legal ownership of movie  u buy it  but ofcourse there s some for promotional  personal and education use  it s all up to you on how you treat those movie u download  also  it depend on wat type of movie  mostly new and current one be basically illegal  but for those old but goody be somehow permit to share online  for those type of movie  i suggest two thing  first  for online viewing  there be youtube  veoh  google video  megavideo  joox  supernovatube  imeem etc  that u could check and watch some movie second  u could download it  a this be what you ask for right   use different method  some like  you could use website assistance like keepvid  clipnabber  file2hd  splandoo  downloadflv  mediapirate  feelingtea  video downloader  and many more to check from  just copy and paste the link of video you require to those website and press ok or get or whatever it mention there then the original link of the movie will be show   
if you use mininova org a your torrent seaker  than look for the axxo movie  those be always great quality  
mfx be right  axxo movie be the best and  pal  the argument about the torrent never end  they say that the guy who upload the movie obtain a legal copy and purchase that and then he be free to do whatever with it  copy it or destroy it or throw it in the garbage  so if there be someone to be question then it should be the one who upload it  not the people download the movie  one more thing  140 q r for an original dvd    do n t you think that it be really so so overpriced  
utorrent or just go to www watch movies net and u can watch all new movie online for free  also no need to register  if u have the realplayer 11 u can download them too  have fun

i think you select a really good name for yourself  boogieman  ok you want to close down the cheap dvd shop  what else do you want to do  i recommend you start with the traffic  we need lot of help with all these people who ignore the traffic rule  i think that would be more worthwhile and maybe you can even safe live  much good than try to close down a dvd shop and more rewarding  aisha taweela 
i soooooo agree with boogieman  it be offensive to a decent person such a myself to allow the purveyance of copy dvd in this country of hidden culture and understated beauty  bring back hanging i say  hey ho  back to the gin   
nice try with the dvd stuff  also give a try to get the modern slavery  read sponsorship  outlaw  get the traffic rule right  and get the poor labourer a decent living standard use a bit from the vast oil and gas wealth  whew u get a load  man  
labourers dont have bread  let them eat cake    well we all know what happen to her dont we  hey ho  back to the gin  
if you get the shop close down you arnt help anyone all you be do be get the poor guy work in the shop drag to the police station and chuck out of the country and then he have to go back to his family  probably in india  with no money and he cant get another job here for what five year think about it first if it not hurt anyone let it be

rent a car would be a safe bet  however if you think you wont meet with an accident and it for a short while then you may drive his car  it risky though so it your call  
yes you can drive  it be the car that be insure  not the driver  
you can  i always drive my friend s car whenever i be in qatar  it be risky though  just drive safely  
you can drive your friend car as far a it be register in his name  its legal be careful and cheer   
but be careful  you shall not get any insurance protection after certain  day from date of entry in qatar  
make sure you re familiar with the mode of drive here  hehehe   
yeah  be do that when i use to come here and i still have have the uae visa  just be careful  and dont let the fault of others be yours  god bless    
sure you can  just avoid get violation like beat the red light  illicit parking  overspeeding  ect  coz absurd penalty go to the registered owner account  
yes you can  i drive someone else s car all the time  do n t run any violation a suggest by metaphor 
qatar living lounge driving license validity if u r a holder of qatar driving license and ur visa get cancel and go back again here for visit visa is ur qatar drive license still valid and can still be allow to drive again here  any idea  
there be an expiry date on your licence  it be valid till that date  
yeah  otherwise one would ask what the expiry date be for  
thanx batman  i know that it have 5 year validity but some people be say that once u r cancel and no longer hold residence permit we do not have the right to drive here while hold a visit visa unless we have international driving license  
that make no sense  licence remain valid even after visa cancellation  
traffic cop would hardly ever ask u for ur id card  all they l wan na see be ur driver s license  ur car s ownership  if license be valid u r on safe end  
you need to get a temperory drive license  go to traffic department  give your drive license and they will give you a temerory driving licence until the date of your visit visa end  they charge qr 100 as well  
yes it valid  khalas  
khalas  indeed  lol

cars and drive how do i get my drive license at 17 years old  hey guy  i be wonder how i could get my drive license when i m 17 because some of my friend start drive and get their license when they be 17 without any problem  thank you 
i try and i could n t  as far a i know you ca n t take the driving test before 18  you can take lesson before turn 18 and take the test after your birthday  
nope  masha allah   
then how come my friend get their official license when they be 17 
who know  are they qatari  i know that some qataris manage to get license before 18 but not others  
i think  
no they re not qatari  they re foreigner 
check with traffic police directly in madinat khalifa  they will be able to guide you correctly regard the age requirement  if there be a rule for age limit  then rule be same for everybody  with rp only one can apply and in rp age be there  
maybe they get it from before  the important thing be that i seriously doubt that you can get a driver license now  just take lesson now and take the test when you be 18  you can survive a few more months weeks   
i try for my son who be 17  could n t even get permission to take class  can anyone guide me how to arrange class for my son  he be still 17  
pmp candidate just go to the traffic police in madinat khalifa where you get application for drive license  fill them out  do the eye test  take the application to your near drive school and pay for lesson  you can probably get lesson before 2 month prior to his 18th birthday  
qatar living lounge drive a vehicle without any license what will be the punishment for drive a car  friends or someone s  without a driving license in doha

sightseeing and tourist attraction inland sea can you tell me if there be somewhere at the inland sea where i could visit without a 4x4  we have a good new car  acadia  but it be n t 4 wheel drive so certainly wo n t be drive over any dune    just wander if there be somewhere there that can be access without a mountain of dune  thanks in advance ellie x 
make sure you take lot of water with you and a good news paper to read while you be wait to be rescue  
in my personal opinion  you can reach inland sea without a 4x4  we tow a vehicle all the way back from there so   
timebandit  what a lovely response    that would be the exact reason i ask if there be a route without a 4 wheel drive  i credit myself with a little intelligence  
a big no from the safety point of view  
thanks t coffee or me  we have actually decide not to go there today  not go to risk it until our friend be back and we can all go together     we be go to have a little drive round the coast maybe al wakhra  sp   just to show the in law  who be visit  a bit more of qatar  
i be tell it could be do  would i risk it myself  no  now put the gun back in your handbag will you  
ohhh forget to mention your car will get spoil in some way or the other  
i ve be there a few time already  but always in a group of at least 4 car  i can tell you that some of my friend keep their car on 2wd mode most of the time  but i consider these guy very experience a they only need to use the 4wd mode when get someone out of trouble  my old bos even have to drive back  in an isuzu trooper  mind you  from deep within the inland sea only on 2wd because the gear box malfunction  so  i stand with tb that it can be do but will not risk it myself  
lol  timebandit  it be safely back in it s place       we have no idea what the inland sea would be like  hence the question  lol  so anyway we decide to take the in law to the singing sand dune  a bit of a mission to find them  a all the direction i have find on the web be sketchy at best     but we get there in the end and they sing for u        we shall do the inland sea when more of u can go  thanks guy xxx 
sorry i may be respond a bit late for your trip but me and my husband go on an organised trip to the sand dune and inland sea during eid  i be not a driver myself but would recommend be in a 4x4 vechicle  as for the inland sea it worth go but dont get to excite about it  it not that much to see really

elegance it just luck some time  some time you get a bargain and other time you see item advertise more than their market value  just keep on try you will find genuine seller who may offer car at reasonable price  some people be just use the classifieds to make money by buy and sell car  avoid such advert and people  
the seller obviously want a good deal for his car  so he will sell his car for a high price depend upon the model and condition of the car  the buyer have to negotiate and also technically check the condition of the car before buy it  
people want to make a profit on whatever they be sell  so they will put their asking price  it for your to judge the price  do your own research  check the market value  compare price and then take a informed decision

 on his way out of church after mass  uk stop at the door to speak to the minister    would it be right    he ask    for a person to profit from the mistake of another      absolutely not    reply the pastor  disappoint that uk would even ask such a question    in that case    say uk    i wonder if you d consider return the hundred pound i pay you to marry my wife and me 5 year ago     
advice and help vehicle maintenance what do we need to do for vehicle maintenance  routine check ups and part replacement  etc  any tip  
vehicle maintenance be do base on km run  
it s there  
to which level do you want to go with your maintenance  a formula 1 car be dismantle totally after each race  
i mean the part that need to be replace after certain time or mileage  this morning my colleague tell about some timing belt which need to replace after 100000km  etc  i be talk about car  
timing belt  serpentine belt  brake pad  fluid  transmission filter  oil filter and other fluid  grease in several joint of the suspension  battery status  sensor  sparkplugs  and anything that do n t work properly  
time belt  for all i know  should be replace on or before 200  000 mileage  other stuff  depend on your use  if you can afford it  do change oil filter transmission oil greasing of joint every month  maximum once every 3 month if you ca n t afford  brake pad  once in 3 month  depend on the usage also  
thanks lp  you mean only when it do n t work properly or be there any fixed time to check and replace to prevent further damage  now my vehicle have run 100000 km but it be fine  i have only be do routine oil  filter change and once battery and brake pad replacement in five year time  
yes  sag  the interval be give in the user s manual  if you have one  
i want to learn from people s experience  lp  anyway  thanks  
you have to follow the manual from the car manufacturer  that be why they make the car and they have study for a decade  if you have or you own the car you can make and experiment of your own  buddy  let say every 3000 kms of run you have to change oil  or there be some sound you have notice then you have to visit to the service center for checkup  sometimes advice from other people it could n t help you  
qatar living lounge drink driving has anyone be catch drink drive here  i get catch last week  just wonder what penalty i can expect  hoping for just a fine but wonder if anyone have have worse punishment  also can you leave the cuntry  spelt on purpose by the way   whilst still await ur trial  cheers  
i have not be catch  but from what i have be tell  the consequence be severe  i buy if you will be able to leave the country  they will register your passport number at the airport and prevent you from leave  that s all hear say  btw  whatever you vividly imagine  ardently desire  sincerely believe and enthusiastically act upon  must inevitably come to pass  
 one of my friend smash his car while drunk  the punishment and fine be very severe  not sure u wan na hear about them  he be n t able to leave the country till the punishment be over  but his case go to court and hearing go for quite a while  hope ur do n t   dont take life too seriously  you will never get out alive       
go to moi gov qa den go to traffic violation den type ur plate  den it will show if you have offense i hope dis simple information help you   
your gon na get whipped lool 
thanks for your insightful comment samya  very articulate  well do  
 actually duncheski samya s right  it may happen  it be part of my friend punishment    dont take life too seriously  you will never get out alive       
y exactly do you need to drink and drive  whereever u be in the world  there be consequence for this type of thing  y have u get issue with it  
cutting thru the crap it appear likely i ll get a fine  esp a i have a lawyer  i think the whipping deportation be prob rumour  i didn  t cause an accident too so hop that prison wo n t be an option  
i would suggest dr najeeb al nauimi  he be a former minister of justice  be very penitent and talk to your sponsor  if your sponsor be powerful and your job be important you might get away with it  otherwise you may have to go to jail for one to four week and then you will be deport  i know a couple of people who have get away with it and one person who be deport  you will not get whip  unless you be a muslim   good luck  just call me tigasin  that s what i m talk about 
dude if u re so worried about this crap   then do n t have a head full of crap and drink and drive  it do n t take a clever clog to realise that now do it    p

if u know also tell me     
can u find her mobile number  then the chip be register at qtel that will have her id that will have her sponsorship detail however this info be confidential and you may need a high authority to intervene there may be a really good reason why she do n t want to be contactable by her mother  one would assume she would have keep up contact if she so wish  maybe ask her mother to seek advice from near qatar embassy  
go to cid and make a complain 
to oryx  u re right  maybe she do n t want to be contact by her mother  though i tend to believe she be either indolent or in deep trouble  i shall talk with her mother again and explain her the option  to colomboplan  that work too  thank you guy for your information

qatar living lounge be it ok  hi qlers  please advice  my friend  boyfriend come to visit here in qatar around 2 month ago  now my friend be worry she have a positive pregnancy test but might be have a miscarriage  she have spot and severe abdominal pain  can she go to a gynecologist for check up  would she be question why she s pregnant when she s not marry  please advice  thanks  
they should ve take the necessary precaution beforehand  but nevertheless  she should consult an ob gyn immediately to be certain a to her condition  
i do n t think she have a choice  she should go to her obgyn and cross her finger that the obgyn wo n t rat her out to the authority  
well  hopefully  the ob s main concern would be her situation  and examine her advise her to consult an ob gyn now  
another possible unwed pregnancy situation  what tangle web we weave  
silly girl   i hope she be ok  whatever you vividly imagine  ardently desire  sincerely believe and enthusiastically act upon  must inevitably come to pass  
 from this mistake  anyways  tell her to go to the doctor  if she s not pregnant  then no problem  if she be and they ask her if she s married  she can say yes  if they ask for a license  she can say   i do not know i be suppose to bring it  i will next time   then she need to leave the country asap   
 hmm  if she be report deedee it will be pretty easy to figure out  i know of someone that have this happen to her a few year back  she didnt have any issue when she go to a private doctor rather than a private hospital  even if she be not miscarry how do she propose to pull this off when it be time for the baby to arrive  she will have to leave qatar before she start to show anyway     diplomacy be the art of say nice doggie  until you can find a rock  will rogers    
nothing be more relax than fly like an eagle in heaven   no it not ok  she must go out somwhere  they will report to the cid and they ll come  
safest  leave the country  if she ca n t  go see a private doctor  and ask them to do an ultrasound on her  trans v g l    tell them that she be marry  they do n t really ask for detail  or if they do follow deedee s advise  once it be confirm that she really be pregnant and might be miscarriaging  there be med that willl help  then  get out of here fast  back to the number one option  uhhh and pray  hope she will be ok   
no chance of abortion   or  it s against law  
visas and permits runaway maid  how to get pasport and noc hi guys  i be try to help someone here  if a maid run away from her agency   i find out from the agency that they hand over the passport to the cid  be there anything she can do to get the passport back somehow and get a noc to start work  i m afraid it might be mission impossible but any suggestion  
embassy  they wil recommend solution  
 if she doent have birth certificate and other document nccessary to make a passport she wouldnt be able to  she be stick here and no one will hire her cuz she prooved herself not   trustworthy    
they sure do      go with her to the cid  take her fingerprint and send her home  
go to the embassy if you need help  
read the comment above  embassy be useless in this matter  
they will take care of her  
and here s the bad news  cover for this person will do you harm than good  so bring this person to the embassy so they will know what to do  but the option i think be to be deport  the embassy can bargain for no more jail time  
it seem the only way i guess  shame  we would really like to employ her but it seem she have get herself into a pickle  
sorry but you cant help her  the best way be buy for her a plane ticket and drop her to the embassy  she will be safe  
big question why she run away  best thing to do be seek the help of the polo office  but i m wish you luck if you get good treatment a my husband have witness how they treat run away maid  their reason for act such be that some of the maid they try to help would end up go back to their employer  so all the effort that the embassy have do be put to waste  
salary and allowances public holiday for live out housemaid hi  i hope somebody can gim me some advice  if i hire a live out housemaid who come to my house every sun thu for about 8 hour a day  pay a fix monthly income  do she entitle off day on public holiday  meaning if the public holiday fall on either day on sun thu  thanks  
do you or do your husband get public holiday off and pay for  there lie your answer  be fair and remember that your housemaid be a human be like you  
they re also human  so it would be nice if u d give her a break  but a the holiday be meager in this part of the world  it wo n t be much 
no  and if she live with you no  exception be if the public holiday fall on her normal day off  if you need her on those day she must work for you  
it s call a public holiday and she be a member of the public and not a slave d mn it  
it all depend on the contractual obligation  however  be a maid  she too deserve rest  a holiday  if not for 3 day atleast for 2 day and on mutual understanding she can come for 2 hour atleast depend on the need  besides all  the flexibility between both be more useful tool here  take care   
she deserve those day off  especially if she have family  but if she wish to work  because she need the money  then that be up to you  
she s not a slave  she s a person just like you  
i sponsor our house maid and i go by the rule in which my sponsor put on me  i m entitled to public holidays and so  therefore  be my housemaid  mine have just return from a month holiday and be still entitle to her public holidays and day off  heaven forbid        but she s worth it because she be happy and rested   
thanks for all your advises  just for your info  she have 2 day off every week  fri  sit  
then you allready give her too much holiday  
qatar living lounge run away house maid my dear house help run away with her boyfriend  what be the legal formality in this event  should i report it to the police the same day she runaway  i try to tell her that ill give her release so she can get married atleast  but maybe shes too scared ill send her right away to jail and so she choose to run away  right now  i just want to abide by the law and go on with my life  
she cant exit without exit permitt   dont worry she will come back to you one day  
but this time dont let her in 
chevroletaveo  her come back be not the problem  if op s maid ever get caught do something wrong in qatar then op will be question a her sponsor  to the topic  i dont know much about the whole process  but first thing you should do be report her missing absconding to your near police station and then follow their instruction  
oh dear  i try to advice her  i hope i wont catch up with her mess in case she do get arrest  besides the trouble she cause me the last thing i would want be to involve in her faulty decision  i wonder how they will survive together  from what i know her bf be only a construction worker  well thanks for all the response  this be the first time that it happen to me so im not actually familiar with it  ill do a you guy advise  
your report her run away be to protect yourself  especially if she s under your sponsorship  anything that would happen to her or whatever she do  it s your responsibility  if you have a copy of her passport  go to her embassy and report her  at least her country s embassy here in qatar will be able to assist her in case she want to go home  
999    
dear sukie  did she get abused physically or mentally abuse by any member of the house hold or by the neighbour  you may also contact nhrc  national human rights commission  and check her wherabouts  dont get me wrong  your version of the story may be right base on some evidence you may have  but there be always a but  and know the human right violation take place around here that could be a place she may seek refuge there too  
why the maids no have right for make their own life after the work  why some of them run  maybe its time for everyone think about  maybe something its wrong  allah akbar 
yep  i agree  hit the police station as soon a possible to protect yourself  why the hell do n t some of these maid just tell their employer that they would like to give a month  notice and will help them find a new maid  employment can end on a civilised note between employer and employee  it happen all the time  
same same story

qatari culture qatari wedding we have be invite to a qatari wedding this thursday  and apart from not know anyone  a my husband will be on the men s party and i will be at the woman s party  to state the obvious   i have no idea what to expect and what the custom be  what should i wear  do we bring a gift  what happen during a wedding  i be very honor to have be invite but terrify of make a fool of my self  
qatari wedding  gents section  there sure will be two diff section one each for lady and gent  the practice be to greet the groom and his family elder first  then be seat in the hall  red tea arabic coffee will be served will be call for the buffet dinner have dinner and say good bye and thanks to the groom n the family member and leave  ladies  not sure about the custom  dg  amensia might help  ps  be sure not to use mobile camera phone  
qatari weddings be fun  i have be to 23 wedding on my last count  i love it  it s an amazing culture  try and take a friend with you  and be prepare to dance  just kidding  you will not be allow to take your phone  and be prepare to eat lot of nice food  have fun  
do n t take a gift  and dress like you would if you be go to a wedding back home  the lady all look lovely and spend a lot of time do their makeup and wear nice dress  
i know a girl who go to a qatari wedding  she say it get heat because apparently a lot of them turn up with the same outfit on  very embarassing  
qatari wedding     first of all be confident bc no one notice you so do n t be embarress    dress up just like your own style  no one can bother that what you wear    do n t take a snap with your mobile or camera  be carefull      enjoy with buffet     if you be try to escape from a borring party then pls take a friend with you   
i think it be a bit boring  beautiful decoration  heard they cost 60  000qr   table  lot of sweet  however it get started very very late  left at11 00pm  dinner have not start  out of 300 woman in the room i only saw i dress that i like  most be garish and hideously gaudy  lots of bright bright color  feather  sequin  etc  tons of makeup on  they have a runway and a couple of woman play the drum and wail arabic song rather loudly  girls would get up and dance down the runway  so the old woman could check them out a possible daugher in law contender i ve be tell  finally the light go down about 10 00 the fog and light show start  sort of like a rock concert  the bride then come out and walk very slowly down the runway  eventually people come up and shower her head with money  she look scared to death  i learn she be 20 year old and have never meet her husband to be  but have talk to him on the   
so if i have get it right then i should  be prepare for late dinner ie  eat before i go  dress as ghoulish a i can  not take any photo  piece of cake  look forward to the cultural experience 
from my experience  no matter how flamboyantly u dress up  it nothing compare to the qatari lady there  god  they r all so gorgeous  and their way of dress up be amazing  cant afford  lol     abt the gift  no u dont take a gift to the wedding  usually i visit them few day after the wedding  n give a gift  wat happen during a weddin  well  make sure u sit away from the loudspeaker place at all corner of the hall     u can dance if u want  to the arabic song be play there  hhhmmm   n the food part  it yummy  u can starve for a few day after that to lose all those calorie earn on that one evenin    it fun  enjoy   ps  oh yeah  like many others mention above  dont click any snap  n thats if ever they let u carry ur mobile phone inside  usually they hold it at the entrance  so be prepare to be disconnect from the rest of the world for the few hour u spend there  
oh yeah  late dinner  depend on the arrival time of the bride n the groom  n by the way  the lady get a chance to peep at the groom while he escort the bride to the hall  unlike the men on the other side  who cant see who their friend colleague be gettin married to   
unfortunately  i have find qatari wedding to be a bit depress  i have yet to see it a a joyous occassion  i have be to a few in the last few month  and have be very disappointed  the lady seem to be compete with each other in the dress department  and so some outfit be very outlandish  there seem to be so much politics amongs the different group of lady sit at the table  you know  this group do n t like that group  or this part of the family feel snub for some reason   the bride always look terrify and a bit like a geisha girl for all the make  up on her face  i really feel sorry for her  one of the bride i saw  take about 30 min to walk down the isle in front of u a i do n t think she could move with the dress she be wear   and you be right about the mobile thing  i have mine with me in the hall  it have be with me the whole night  i have to answer a phone call  and all of a sudden my phone be snatch out of my   
socialising new dress rules  not sure if this be the right section of site to post in  but  have just see this thread on expatwoman http  www expatwoman com forum messages aspx  topicid 69168 and want to know what rule be these  be they new  how bloody daft be they consider nightclubs etc  should i buy an abaya next time i want a nice dinner at w s    thanks 
 here s the content of the thread  you be probably all aware by now that there be new dress regulation in place in qatar  the 4 and 5 star hotel be give 10 day to comply with the new rule which be that you must be   appropriately dress    no explanation of what this be but it seem to be no knee  even at night in nightclubs etc  and no shoulder  i ve hear of people be refuse entry to restaurant for have slit up their dress and  in the case of a 14 year old  show their knee  i ve be tell the shopping centre be also now turn people away for wear halter neck etc  landmark in particular   one friend just ring me to say that a group of her girlfriend be stop from go into w last weekend  each of them have something   inappropriate   from cleavage  to knees to shoulder  you also have to now show either your id card or passport for entry into bar and  the scary part  if you be n t dress appropriately they take your id card and scan it and send    
i m all for clamp down on inappropriate clothing in the shopping mall and in public  but i think there should be more leeway when it come to the hotel  also  they should have start implement these rule a decade ago  they ve let thing go to far to have a hope in hell of police it properly  
how ridiculous  either pass a law  like saudi  say we all have to wear abaya  or leave it be  the middle ground be too subjective  
i saw someone be turn away from the zoo  but that s just the zoo                        quidquid latine dictum sit  altum sonatur  
ooops   p 
what a joke  the club and bar be about the only place a girl could look nice and not worry about shoulder  knee and cleavage showing  no offence but anyone who could potentially be offend by short skirt or low cut top should n t be in the club anyway  is qatar turn into saudi  qatar will never get any tourism with stupid rule like this  www qaws org 
 hmm  i be not sure that show knee and cleavage be the only way a girl can look nice     diplomacy be the art of say nice doggie  until you can find a rock  will rogers    
saudi do not have a law regard abaya  amoud  agree with you totally  
this be great news    way to go qatar  d its about time  
amoud  maybe not  but if a country be go to allow nightclubs then it have to accept that there s a certain style of dress that come with them  they seem to want the best of both worlds  western trapping with qatar conservatism  it wont work  they need to decide what they want and stick with it  
doha shopping maternity clothes any advice on where to buy maternity clothes  so far  the few mall i ve look have either a terrible selection  i e  a selection of 3 different item  or the price be out of control  i m to the point of buy online and pay to ship  any idea   please  serious comment only  i m in no mood for sarcastic  silly  male humor this morning   
hi minoush  i think you probably try these shop already  ie  mothercare  mark and spencer  bhs  next  yup selection be awful  and price be ouch  have you try h  m  they do have many trouser  price range be 160 250qar  the other thing to do would be to invest in good pair of basic colour trouser and get your top stitch  
have n t try mothercare at cc  i hate go there but i may have to  m  s do not have a maternity section  i do n t get this  every local have at least 5 kid  plus every expat seem to be pregnant  where do they all shop for clothes  
i try h  m and their selection be ok  the only problem be the pant have this new fangled design where the waist be suppose to sit below your waist and it felt like my pant be about to fall down  just too hip and cool for me  i m old and i need mom jean     i will try bhs  i m use to target and discount store  the idea of pay  80   100 for a pair of pant that i will wear for 6 month be impossible  checked online  ship from motherhood maternity from the states be  70 for a ton of clothes  i think i will just do that   thanks lady   and thank you men for hold in your impossibly crude comment that you all love to make on every thread   
try babyshop and max in city center  thay have good collection 
hi minoush  you will have to go to mothercare at cc  because apparently all maternity wear from other mc shop be to shift to mc of cc  if not already there  you need to visit the mc inside debenhams  the local wear the abbaya  so a loose gown inside  the jalabiyas  more like the house maxi  be not visible to anybody  among asian clothes there be many loose top in style right now  with lycra tights  so again no problem there  getting t s be not an issue  as long a you be okay with it hug you tight all day  the trouser style  be the low bump style right now  and it doesnt really fall off h  m have the high waist trouser  not sure about baby shop for maternity clothes  else you may have to try the large clothes section  like evans  if you be look for comfy top  check giordano a well  they dont have maternity  but they usually have these loose comfy linen trouser that you can tie under the bump  
based on all our comment  a trip to city centre be on the card     you should find what you be look for in atleast one shop there  you can also check chico  
thanks all  yes a trip to cc will be in my near future  also  i think legging with long loose top  i know of a good tailor who can make some blouse for me  
if you want a bargain  try shopping at mr  price in hyatt plaze  prices range from 60 qar  100 qar  low price compare to the other brand shop  
make a rude  comment in here  i be hold myself since the start of the thread  many congrats  
i agree  pretty bad  even bad if you want to buy something for work  h m be fine if you be look for casual but that be it  bhs do not have a maternity section  i ask in the one in landmark  and mothercare be very expensive  perhaps order over the internet

qatari culture packing and confuse o k  i be frustrate and need some seasoned advice  what be the most important thing i should pack in luggage  i do n t know if i can even wear half of the clothes i have here in florida  suggestions  i be pack right now and it be 2 45 a m  help  do i say i need assistance   
pack as much a u can            coz u can wear pretty much anything     sanz 
there be an unofficial dress code for woman of keep shoulder and knee cover  also nothing too tight fitting  clothes suitable for summer for most of the year   img nid 57389 title desc peace link none align left width height 0   www nfcr org 
would n t suggest bring anything transp arent  unless you gon na wear it with the under top  i love and use to wear very short skirt in canada  i don t feel like wear them here  i only wear them at home my style have be change here  i become more modest with my clothes  even though it take some time    img nid 94788 title desc link none align left width height 0  sun and i 
do n t listen to them  they be jealeous of you  they do n t have a nice body to show off   bring as much a short pant and hot pant to counter the deadly heat here 
just keep in mind that this be a muslim country  and it get really hot in summer  u wont get to wear everything u wear in florida but just wear something decent  u can wear whatever u want at home but when ur out u need to respect the culture around here  so anything decent that u think isnt to reveal to give people the wrong idea be fine    btw ksarat  darude and i will be wait with arm wide open to meet u in doha  so please dont bring ur husband  boyfriend just leave him behind   j k     smoke     
you can wear whatever you want here  but if you wear skimpy clothes people will stare  never mind the clothes  if you be blonde ppl will stare at you anyway  make sure you pack goody that you like  for example  your favorite shampoo  bubble bath  you do n t really find nice one like radox here  they re either really cheap or really expensive   hand cream  you ll need load of hand cream here  if you have a favorite brand bring it along with you   body lotion etc  
sooo i agree with you qatarisun  tht be where the problem lie  being in florida  most of the clothes i have do not cover shoulder or knee  i do love fashion so i guess i ll fiure it out  btw  have an interview on sunday at asd  what should i wear  
charan  stop it   how you dress will have some bearing on how you be perceive and treat a with anywhere  i go walk in tracksuit and baggy t shirt  some do wear shorts  but i just want to go around my daily life with minimum fuss  i save dress up for go out  
do n t wear anything  go naked   
pack clothes suitable for summer  i mean the real summer a in hot and sticky desert type  if u have lot of shoes sandals footwear bring them all

qatari culture qatari wedding secrets  okay im not sure if this be appropiate  a i be not try to offend anyone  but i keep hear some middle eastern people tell me that the qatari wedding be know for get down and dirty  behind all these smile  no one tell me what this mean    what the heck happen at these wedding     i would really like to know  
i ve only be to one  but if you mean dull a dogshit when you say down and dirty  than i guess thats right  the party be separate into two group  men and woman  and there be no alcohol  at least at the womens party  they dance to loud disco music and dress scantily for other woman while critizing what every other woman be wear  not exactly the great party of all time  
doha girl   be u call our wedding dogshit    the least u can do be show respect in the country ur in        by the way  u ca n t judge wedding here by attend only one   im a qatari and i attend soooo many wedding and this be how it be here  no alcohol  no mixing if u want alcohol and what ever u have in mind then find what please u somewhere else    scantily dress u say  a i say u cant judge all wedding by just one  it depend on the wedding and family  oh and whats wrong with dance 2 loud music   dont u do that every now and then just in a diffrent place   
hello bobo  i dont exactly know what u mean   i ve be to so many weddings  it be nothing like down and dirty  sorry bobo   
 the men s part of the wedding be pretty straight forward  invitees congratulate the groom and his father  brother  you sit next to him for the traditional coffee and tea  have a picture take with him  later on there s a buffet and an   ardha   which be a traditional sword dance  very nice  beautifully decorate garment  after that groom go to the woman s party and join the bride  at least these be my first hand observation  there s no   down and dirty   part there   
 qatar girl   dull a dogshit   be an expression  i do n t mean your wedding be dog shit  i mean they be bore   
the internet be international territory  i have be to several and i agree with dg  obviously i be in the lad section 
dig away dg  
well super it be slightly more interesting than the korean wedding i go to  at least it have a party afterwards  and i hate loud music and dance unless i m drunk  so a qatari wedding be n t my idea of fun  so sue me  i ve say lot of nice thing about qatar and qataris but there wedding be not fun by my standard of fun wedding  
qatari wedding be not fun  the woman party be there so that the prospective mother in law could select future wife for their son  i be at a loss what men party be for  to be honest  
no drinking and importantly no single woman in romantic mood with 10 glass of champagne in them  nah barely any point go 
politics why they be dress like that  why most of the european woman be not properly dress  are they feel some sort of satisfaction to express themselves  it be also imitate by asians nowadays  only for your comment pls  
most     base on which wide sweep survey  or be you talk about european woman in europe where they be free to dress however the heck they feel like  
what would you define a properly dress  
huh  ovum here  wow  dint know that  
properly dress for what glorious occassion  
please specify proper dress before we comment  
 sounds like you re try to start one of those   oh i do n t like them cause they be different   thread   
european woman be dress like shameless hussy and cause discod within society  they should be severly punish  preferably in a public place  
i haven t arrive yet to qatar  but i ve get a funny stupid question for you all  are there any woman take the sun of any give beach in qatar  this might sound stupid to some of you  but truly  i have no idea what to expect in many aspect when arrive to doha   p wondering around  
well it be cold  wait until it get warm so we can at least see a bit of flesh  
dress modestly thats all i say  bikinis on private beach no problem  just dress like you do in your own country  as long a you dont dress like a tart and wonder in public you will be fine  saying that you could dress like a tart and get away in the bar here  hmmm let me think             he who dares wins 
qatar living lounge saturday night in doha  qube nightclub  hi all  me and some friend from london be look to come over to doha for a couple of week  whats the party scene like on friday and saturday night  i hear that in qatar nobody go out on saturday  be that true  where would you go for rnb and hiphop  and ive heard alot about a club call qube be it any good  any feedback would be welcome thanks  
if you enjoy filipino cover band and lot of asian variety in the crowd then the qube be great  however if you enjoy more of the western flair you be down to garvey s  rugby club  and rydges  of these your best bet for fri and sat night  my opinion  so no flame from anyone  be go to be rydges  the bar be under new aussie management with the goal of much good music and faster service  this past weekend be quite busy and the music be good enough to dance to  so there you hav it  one recommendation 
go to beirut  thats where the clubing be i always tell the truth  even when i lie 
is pretty good on a thursday night  nice crowd of people and a good british band  not club though  for club there be only the pearl  with the awful dj jojo  and cloud nyn where the crowd be very very young  i guess if you want club you really do have to go to beirut  
 not good idea to come to have a party in qatar  qatar be a   muslim   country  muslims be not allow to drink alcohol  be in unnecessary co ed place  coming to qatar to have party be strange  maybe you could save money for other purpose other than party   
i agree with tyler and bbksiu  although the best way to enjoy your weekend in doha be by get together with friend in one of our house  have dinner  bbq  and drink  alcohol  you can buy alcohol if you have the license  play some game  e g  risk and card  watch the late dvd  you can put music on and dance  becareful your neighbor      and if you too drink to go home  your friend can get you a lift  or there always a taxi  so you not worry to get cought on drunk and driving  
someone agree with me  that never happen  perhaps i take my mediaction today and have a rare lucid think  p 
 amaru immortal  clubs  i mean night club  here in qatar be no comparison to what you d find in a non muslim country  they both serve alcohol  have music  live djs  but that s where the comparison end    where would you go for rnb and hiphop    take a plane and go somewhere else     i d suggest heat or mercury lounge in melbourne for rnb hip hop      bit of promotion from an ex employee  if you still wan na come to the middle east for clubbing  go to beirut or istanbul  maybe even cairo for that matter  or go to goa  india if you wan na spend xmas at trance party on the beach  or go pub hopping in bangalore    i hear that in qatar nobody go out on saturday  be that true    true  we go out on thursdays  that s the weekend here  happy hour start at 5 30pm   
it suck 
thanks for the info  i have friend in doha and they say that there be a rumour that two top london djs  one playing hiphop rnb the other playing house will be perform  if anyone have far info that would be great  
for the coolest and the noisy place in doha  qube be the place    they ve get the crowd with the ohh la la band    check this out  www mocha com ph they be the performer  
politics hijab  a burden to muslim woman  why only a few muslim woman wear hijab  why not others  is hijab make a woman outdated   plz share your comments  
i do n t think it s possible to make woman outdated  but hijab might be come outdated yes  
 in one word  choice    deaths in the bible  god  2  270  365 not include the victim of noah s flood  sodom and gomorrah  or the many plague  famine  fiery serpent  etc because no specific number be give  satan  10     
i hate that ad  it s such crap  
posted  discuss a billion trillion time   
infact the muslim woman wear hijab in the west be on the increase where a else where it decreasing i wonder why           he who dares wins 
 these be mostly the new reverts  maybe some sort of fresh eagerness to show their new identity    dgoodrebel will always be the rebellious good one    
 prophet muhammad  peace be upon him  say    avoid be naked  for with you be those who never leave you  the angels  except when you be relieve yourselves and when a man have intercourse with his wife  so observe modesty before them and honor them    al tirmidhi hadith 3115 narrated by abdullah ibn umar help people  the allah  god  will help you  
 i really dont think a piece of cloth can define a woman in the least  would some amazonian tribe feel some woman be burden by have their breast bind by a bra  i think this sort of question be only a mean to excite emotion     diplomacy be the art of say nice doggie  until you can find a rock  will rogers    
allah say in the holy quran chapter 33 surah ahzaab verse 59  o prophet  enjoin your wife and daughter  and the believing woman  that they should cast their outer garment over their person  it be expect that they will thus be recognize  and not molest  allah be oft forgiving  most merciful  allah say in the holy quran chapter 24 surah nur verse 31   o prophet  enjoin the believe woman to restrain their gaze and guard their modesty  and not to display their adornment except that which be display of itself  and to draw their veil over their bosom  and not to display their adornment except before their husband  their father  and also forbid them to stamp their foot on the ground l their hidden ornament should be display  allah say in the holy quran chapter 4 surah nisaa verse 103  indeed the salaat   prayer  be a prescribed  and obligagtory  duty that should be perform by the believer at  their  appoint time  in light of the above absolutely c   
it s their choice if they want it or not  
doha airport v s doha malls are the item inside doha airport  duty free  cheap compare to those that be sell inside the mall  
qatar living lounge is duty free actually duty free  flying home  stopped off in dubai  rushed to duty free in the departure lounge to get mrs  expat a gift  bought some perfume  later find that the same perfume be 12  cheap in a london department store  so  be duty free a myth  have you experience similar  
 flying home  stopped off in dubai  rushed to duty free in the departure lounge to get mrs  dracula a gift  put some perfume in my hand bag  the police catch me    i think it s for free   i say  help   
you carry a hand bag  o  
i think it be also for free    help again  
it duty free for them means they make money without any duty   
one can not compare the prize other than the duty free country  
brit you will find a similar phenomenon everywhere  it be duty free technically  but you be also pay more for the same thing  just not on custom 
my wife use hugo boss xx and it cost 260 qr at the airport and 180 qr at carrefour  even we an find the same for the price 160 qr  once i ask and the duty free guy say they be have the original one and others not  
benefit be you wo n t have to pay charge for the weight of the item you purchage at the duty free shop   other meaning be that place  be for customer who be free from duty  from their workplace   head for holiday  i suppose  
i think cigarretes be only cheap in dubai df  moreover i guess price in df s be less in comparison to the city they be in and can not be compare with price else where in the world  i buy a couple of jw black label at qatar df while fly to sychelles hop it would be costly there but it be actually cheap  
 qdf be cheap than the dubai duty free  it s call skim the market

qatar living lounge qatar v bahrain anyone live in both place  can anyone give me objective pro and con for each  thanks  
bahrain be well  
and for gypsy in particular  be i mistaken of have i not see many post where you refer to qatar a home  i m under the impression you really like qatar  so why be bahrain well  thanks  
i do consider qatar home and i like it  but that be because i have family and friend here and i try not to let certain thing get me down  my boyfriend live in bahrain however and i visit him there every weekend  bahrain be a lot more laid back  you can buy pork  get a glass of wine and a restaurant and access anything you want on the internet  it do n t have all the oil money so the local be a little more down to earth but it s more developed  better restaurant and shopping mall  most of all  you can get a penthouse apartment for 6000qar  
gypsy i ll bet you anything be well  specially when you be not pay out of your own pocket for your personal expense during that weekend trip  most be real love or lust    emancipate yourselves from mental slavery none but ourselves can free our minds  
and thing will start change in bahrain  isalmic  shiite party control the bahrain parlamant so many voice be demand a more islamic bahrain  locals there be feed up with the saudi invade thier country in weekend  i d like to see your opinion upon that  
thought your comment be uncalled for and why would you assume that gypsy be n t pay her own way in bahrain  
thanks mona lisa  that be completely uncalled for a i do pay for my own way to and in bahrain every weekend  i m not sure what you re try to imply about me red pope  
what do you think about genesis  comment  be there really that many saudi that go to bahrain on the weekend  how do they  the woman  treat the western woman  the saudi  and the more conservative bahraini  my wife  who dress western conservative  always coverering her shoulder and legs down to her ankle  often get dirty look from many of the woman here who be completely cover in black head to toe  her sister even get push around a little by a couple of them  
well i date a saudi so i have to say he and his friend treat me very respectfully  yes lot s of them do go to bahrain on the weekend  but so do a lot of qataris and kuwatis  the place be basically crawl with people from the more conservative nation on the weekend  besides the fact that the number of land cruiser increase and there be more people in the pub i have n t notice a difference  as for dress  i can dress less conservatively in bahrain than here  there be more single woman as well so i do n t feel like i stand out so much  bahrani girl do n t wear the abaya as much a here and i have n t see to many in hijab  i doubt she ll notice many stare at all  as for it become more conservative  well they be close down all the bar in the 3 star hotel because that s where all the prosititutes hang out  but my guess be you wo n t even notice they be go  
thanks for your advice  it sound like i would prefer bahrain  but i think the job in qatar will be well  decision  decision

morning  6 30 7 00am   it take almost 40 45 minute  afternoon  if there be no traffic  30 minute                            i do n t want a signature line to prove that i m great   
thanks  how awesome  i be think it be more like 1 5 hour from what everyone have say about doha traffic     being here in the usa be a bit difficult to find out what area be best to live in doha  my husband and i love be at home  we prefer high rise with a nice gym though give we be bring motorcycle over i be think somthingh be a garage might be best  we have no kid so school and have other kid around u be not a top priority  given this  which areas buildings would you guy recommend  we do n t want to commute more than say 30 40 minute each way if we can help it  to and from new doha airport   what information be there out there about the pearl  i imagine be still be mostly a huge construction site but be there finish buildigns there worth commute to and from  are shop area and restaurant nearby already finish  thanks so much  kiki 
wow  in lusail pearl area    hmmm that s too expensive to live on there  hehhe  there s a lot of villa s here which you can stay peacefully  i ve forget the name of it  so  you re from florida   because your name be kikifl  kiki your name then fl be your place  be i right   hehehe  then   you like photography also  professional   hehehe  that s cool  there s a lot of nice place here to be take a shot in your cam  
 qatar s property development website be mislead a most of qatar itself  what you see be not what you ll get  lusail be a   plan new city   due to open soon but you go there now  all you ll se be an empty desert land with maybe 2 tower crane  pearl be nearly complete but with a lot of infrastructure and other nature problem  both location be at the north outskirt limit of the city  while the new airport be be build at the southern outskirt limit of the city  you do have to across the whole city and the traffic here be another nightmare  not only the traffic jam but also the aggressive and risk drive local style   if no traffic  it will be a 20 30 minute drive  the best location for you would be near by the marriott hotel  a friendly advice  be prepare for the big frustration you ever experience at professional and social level and you wo n t be disappoint  i wish you all the best   
then you go around the place and select for your self  there be plenty of accomodations available with few people to occupy it  depend on your budget  real estate be come down  taste differs from person to person  good luck 
 yes i m from florida and yes photography pay some  of our bill   husband get contract to work in doha so i be think the expensive part of live arrangement there will all depend on what his contract stipulates  thanks for the real estate agent contact mdobrasz  will see if we can start line up some visit to different area and take a look at villa v condo  not sure what be best for u yet  i think give we be go to try to bring our 2 motorcycle a house with a garage will be best  nic  thanks for the advice  i think we ll probably opt to be closet to airport than to drive 1 hour to get to and from work  so far i have see very little   real   picture of doha  mostly plan and projection image of what it will  look like so we figure we re in for huge construction site in the desert    
if you be in doha for a long term contract  it may be cheap just to buy new bike than have them ship  pay gcc taxes  registration etc  etc   just a thought

hi  i be not actually in doha yet myself  arrive at the end of this month  the only vehcile import i have do in doha previously be for the oilfield market  and be do slightly differently  you might be surprise  i see a couple of big bike shop here in doha when i visted a few week back  anyhow  in dubai a few year ago  i import some chopper from the guy off discovery channel program  the duty be 5  of the cif value   eg  bike be us  20000 cif then duty will be us  1000  i then have to pay a local agent commission on the import of us  1500 each a they hold the import licence agreement for the bike  therafter  police inspection  registration and other detail be approx   1200 per bike  then of course you will have standard insurance and road tax  which i believe be approx   100 per month in doha   someone can correct me if i be wrong  pm me if you need further information  i do work in this field and can get a colleague to check all the in and out if require  have

qatar living lounge the mystery of love is it possible to love more than one person at the same time  i mean a woman love more than a man  or a man love more than a woman   i mean by love this thing that we all feel inside  anybody can define the love  i hope that i could delivered the idea very well  
anyone who tell u they can define love be a damn lair  love be n t something definite and noone can tell u what it be  u can only feel it  and u feel it differently towards different people  i mean u love ur friend in a different way than ur fiancee for example  so in that aspect  yes u can love more than one person at the same time in different way  
is the feeling that you feel when you feel the feeling that you never felt before     
am a damn liar now   p how be you today  
lol apple  ur not a liar because u do n t define love  yeah it s that wonderful feeling but can u say what feel it be  u ca n t  i mean people spend year try to write book about love and relationship but it s all nonsense because no relationship be like another  every relationship have it own dynamic and each love be unique so none of u can define love  we recognize it when we feel it but we ca n t define it because each one of u feel it differently  i m do good  take my daily dose of ql hehe  what about u  
love make u feel like crap when it not reciprocate  and make u feel like the dumb person alive when ur hanging on hop  u can love more than one person at the same time but at different degree  lol apple  nice definition u have there of love   p a of now  for me  love really sucks    argh     
defining love what be love  so do you mean that a man have 2 or more wife can not love them w  equal dynamic degree  cornellian  get ready for a trouble girl  
yeah cornellian  this be a good thread     apple i think that he cant love both of them the same way  just like with ur kid  no matter what parent say  there s always someone that they love a little more than the rest  it the same thing with men and their wives gfs  
hi cornellain  it nice to see u here  look i mean the romantic love that relate man and woman together  i know i love a friend becuase she be honest and so on  but i mean of love this romantic thing  u get it  apple  good afternoon my apple    i believe the love come with day  when u discover the ethic and behavoiurs of ur partnter this be all lead u to love him  her  i think the love relate with behaviour  
remember what we talk last coffee night w  my hubby  i think this the right time to ask    good afternoon to yoy ala7  
when you meet a girl of coarse you dont love her yet  you just like her  let s say physical attraction be there  then later  in some case you develop love  but other case dont  what make you love a girl lady women  
qatar living lounge do you own a pet  what do you prefer dogs or cat  i be not so fond of animal inside my house but my son be crazy about pets  i have a parrot  dog  foster  an aquarium full of fish  i like cat  but dogs i don t like them lick me or come near me  but most people i know love dogs  why do some people like dogs and others like cat  
ooops last line i meant why do some people  not animals lol mods please correct my mistake  
well i have 5 cat  but not because i do n t love dog  but rather i think they fit my life style a bit well  cats be a lot easy to care for  i d love a dog  especially now that hubby and i be home so much  but i we do n t have the yard or the space at the moment  
i love cat  bt i dnt hav one at home   
depends  some people do like lick 
cats lick  
i prefer human  
i like cute and innocent faced cat  i hate dog bcoz they bark unnecessarily and spoil our night  
the small white bird you get in animal kingdom  it be always with a pair  
your actual last line be more exactly right  even you need it correction   
do n t like cat and dog  would prefer cat to dog  have keep fish  bird  turtle  guinea pig and rabbit a pet  
advice and help pet rule what be the pet rule in qatar  i mean can we take our pet out in the city or in the car  
u can take no problem beautynbrain  no restriction a such  but those pet should not create nuisance to others  otherwise okay  
no rule  even cheetah be allow in land cruisers  
do u have dog or cat    if u have ne one of them  then i hate both lol do n t ever cross my lane if ever u l come across my way  
soniya i have a kitten  and if you will meet her then you too will love her  
those be not pet  they be for protection  
i just do n t get how some people hate pet  i mean they be so honest  loyal  friendly and fun  they do n t lie over anything just little baby  they do what you like at all time  how could you hate them  you think they be dirty  no they be not if you take care of them  
quagmire people have their own choice  few die for pet and few dont even like to see them  it their own wish  but for me my kitten be like my baby  
quagmire  it do n t mean that the thing that u like may be like by others a well there could be many reason for me for not like pet  its gud that u like and love them but keep it with u  it be my thought and thus i comment same thnx peace

cheetahs be allow in a landcruiser

nice trey so pwede ko n pala apply ng residence visa yung wife  son ko  khit 3 month bank statement makita ko   
hi my husband and i just go through the whole rp thing  we have to give 4 month worth of bank statement so you should double check  will save you alot of run around 
i be go to add  you good check with your company liason officer a to the bank statement  i think it depend on your salary as well because a friend be ask for a 6 month bank statement  
it depend on your company s pro c connection with the authority  i get family visa with 3 month bank statement  no water or electricity bill be produce  
some say 3 month  some say  4 month   maybe i will take chance for 3 months who know  if they reject my application  ill try 4 month  up to six month  be it possible    
better ask first your pro because some bank charge you per bank statement  cbq charge 50qr per bank statement be it 6  4  or 3 month  since they will charge me anyway  i get 6 month statement instead of just 3 to be sure  
is birth certificate of wife be really require   and bytheway  waht be mofa

visas and permits question about wife s visa i will be arrive in doha on the 10th or 11th of december  my wife will be fly in approximately two week later and will be stay with me on my sponsorship for the duration of my contract  when she step off of the plane in doha  she will have her passport  but i do n t know what else she need in order to stay in the country with me  can she get some sort of visitor visa or what  i be not sure what to do here  thanks everyone  
i be not too sure on all the formailities however  would suggest that you get in touch with your embassy  as far a i know  yor wife need a rp  residence permit  which can only be do once you have yours  if she come on the visit visa  she will only be able to stay a few month and will have no right  hospital  bank account find a job etc   not to say that she can not come on the visit visa but she would have to leave after the visa expire and apply for a residency under your name from her country unless she have her own sponslor in qatar  
i already have my visa  it s wait for me once i get there  given that  would n t she be able to come in under my sponsorship and apply for her residence at that point  
you can sponsor your wife only when you have rp  residence permit  in hand  it will take approximately a month for you to get one  from the moment of entry and one more month to do the paperwork for your wife  my suggestion  ask your sponsor now  because they will have to help you with it  
chbck  your wife can come on a company business visa for 3 month renewable 3x  once you get your rp  you can transfer her sponsorship under you  coz the company will give her no objection cert   she do n t need to exit and go back to her country  once you apply for her the business visa  you just need to obtain a support affidavit from your embassy that you will shoulder all her expense during the period  trust me i do it for my cousin  though her sponsor be transfer to her company  and she get residence now  good luck  
ok great  so let me make sure i understand what you be all say  1  my visa be good enough to get her in when she get off the plane with nothing more than her passport  2  she can get any other kind of visa that she need to get once she s in the country and they wo n t make her go home  3  if i leave for doha on december 9th and she leave for doha on december 18th  we will be able to spend christmas together  i understand that i should probably talk to my sponsor about all this too  thank a million yall 
waiiiit  number 2  you have to apply the visa first from here  doha  then send the visa no  to her so  she can print out from the net www moi gov qa  if she need a copy  visa application be just within 2 day  it depend   she just need her passport in the airport here coz her visa detail be already in the computer network system in immigration doha airport  yes sure  you can possibly spend xmas together but u must apply soon a u reach doha  
chbck  dont forget the support affidavit either from her sponsor company or from you to be apply  collect fr ur embassy here in doha 
so i need to fill out that form that you link to and send it to the embassy there in doha  where do i get this affidavit that i have to supply  my company wo n t sponsor her over  it have to be me  
grrrrrrr  lol  ya ammi  it s not a form it a website that link immigration in doha  assuming that you re already in doha  and you want to bring your wife here very very soon  fortunately  u dont have rp yet  there be still a way for her to come but under any company business visa or a tourist visa  but 28 day only  also 3x renewable from travel agency   then transfer to your sponsor once you get ur rp  and she do n t need to go back to her country  for the support affidavit  i think the best way be to get from her sponsor company coz u dont have rp yet that time  right  peace  just wan na help u out  
chbck  sorry i think ur an arabs  just to clear   ya ammi  mean my uncle

visas and permits medical examination info  hi all  i finish my medical exam here in doha  i would like to know besides hiv and tb  be there any other disease check in the medical examination  im only interest in the disease that will make me fail the exam  and how many day or week will the result will be available  thanks 
sif you work in the admin job then u only need to check hiv and ptb result after 3 working day  if you work a a medical  paramedical or any food handler job  you also need to check hepab and hepac   
im an i t  guy so guess i dont have to worry about hepa  what about other std disease  do they check those  
but try to be clear from all these before come here  welcome to qatar  
is the medical exam result always take 3 work day  beacuse my colleague do the fingerprinting 2 week after his medical exam and he say the medical exam result take 2 week  and the only thing for him to know if he pass the medical exam be because he do the fingerprinting process  and be there anyway to know if you pass the medical exam  
once you be do w  ur medical exam you can check w  the medical commission at least after 3 working day  just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you ll get to know if it ready or not  for a medical employee it usually take about 2 wks to have the result do due to other test  e i  creatinine test  that have to be send to hmc for investigation  in your case  you be only require to undergo blood test  hiv   chest x ray  ptb   so i think it wont take long that much  dont you have mandoop representative for your company  he be suppose to follow up all these thing and you can always check w  him  good luck  
thanks apple for always reply on my post  another thing  after medical will i immediately go for fingerprinting or it will be for another week or so

everyone be check for hepatitis c  not just those in medical or food business  after the medical your sponsor be alert via sm about the result  pass fail  assuming all be good next be fingerprint and after that your residence permit can be process  
so if it s find positive do can one obtain iqama  
no  any positive in any of the 3 test and you re denied residency and send back whence you come  
moving to qatar driving test  hello all  i just find out today i can not exchange my american driver s license for a qatari one  i already know how to drive  i may need to practice the parallel parking bit and study the theory again   but do anyone have any suggestion on drive school  i be not look to pay for training course  i want to go directly into the test  thanks  
who tell u that u cant do a straight swap  we do we be british  so im presume it should be the same  although we have to do an eye test  r u sure the person who tell u this info didnt mean an eye test  
yes just an eye test for u brits   sure they didnt mean that  
he get american driving license but his profile say his nationality be hongkong  passport be something here folk  lucky you  you be brit  
ha ha so they think it a fake driver license thats y they make u do test  lol    
if you hav a british or an european dl you can swap straight  else you will have to take up the test  if you kno drive  should be a cake walk  i have an indian dl  i take direct test  cleared it  jus go for it  if you fail  you wud still hav 2 more chance     
am not sure about exchange the licence but for the test first of all there be no parallel park test you can go to raya drive school and go the police officer first with the form and all required document and try to exchange your license if not he will sign the form for you to do the test directly  you should do this first because the school will till that you need to take 10 lesson course you will start at 5 30 with the theoretical  sign exam  they will ask not more than 5 6 sign if you answer with confidence and quickly  the driving school have a small booklet that have around 30 sign then they will let you know if you pass if yes you go out to start the practical exam  1  is the hill test  you have to stop in the middle  on the line paint in the street  then continue till the end of it  then reverse back to you start point  which mean you have to reverse a l shape 2  then you go to the parking test  you have to do it in one shot and make sure not to cross the li   
thanks all  anyone know if a hk driver license can be exchange directly for a qatari driver license  i m not too keen on wake up that early lol  
the test be at 4 30am  i do the test on yesterday  i get all the information on ql  i never do any class i just go to alkhebra drive school get the froms fill out do the eye test and just challenge the course

advice and help diving license  try al khebra driving school hi everyone  anyone interested to get a driver s license with benefit  try it with al khebra driving school  starting 20 october 2009 up to 20 january 2010 every enrollee be entitle to 1 raffle coupon that can make u win a car  grab this opportunity  be a part of this extravagant activity  this be our way of thank our valued customer  goodluck    
 will get her residency this week  what be the procedure requirements for her to enroll to get her driver license  theory driving test  please could you contact me about it  thank you    
ms alumnar  ok  just complete all the requirement  1  eye test for drive lesson 2  sponsor letter  we have form in the school 3  sponsor id 4  ur nanny s id if she dont have it yet then copy of her passport 5  4 pc  photo 
 i have some question   do we do the eye test ourselves in an optician   we live in abu hamour  your drive instructor pick up and drop off from home   i be ask because i see so many of your car in my area   price for theory tests driving lessons test  total price assume first time pass both test   thank you for your help  
that s cool  yeah we have that pick up  drop off but due to lack of driver s now we can not accommodate all a for the moment  but since u live nearby maybe we can arrange it with our manager  for the eye test  u can go to any optician for that  btw  do ur nanny have a license in her home country  can i get ur mobile or landline number so i can call u 2morrow morning to discuss further  thanks goodnight  
i will pm you my contact number  my nanny have no drive license from her home country  thank you meann  goodnight   
i ca n t recommend al khebra at all  their instructor be first rate  but their transportation service be completely unreliable and their office staff rude and barely competent  if you have your own way to the school  take them a the driver be excellent  but they be let down by the disorganization and lack of professionalism of the management  
 with this lady call meann and all i can say be she could n t be any more helpful and supportive  if you have anything to complain about  why do n t you address the mamangement  just drop in directly and talk to them  i be sure that just like me  they will listen to what you have to say and act on it  in the end they want to ensure that they get business  that s what they be there for  
i disagree with you gumby  i take my driviing license from al khebra  the driver be expert and they know about drive technique and point  i take course of 25 day  take license in first try   so i recommend it at the level best  like other famous school  find  it staff take care of costumer  and behave nicely towards them    
in behalf of the management  i be really sorry mr  gumby may i know what particular problem have you encounter from our school so i can address it to the management  the reason y i be here be to resolve any problem our customer may encounter  
i take my driving license frm al khebra in first take  as everything with the good teaching of my instructor  dandry  and his useful driving tip  mostly he have give me encouragement during class which make me to drive comfortable and learn soon  anyone want to become professional in drive learn from al khebra  
working in qatar  driving license hi everyone  i be plan to move to qatar next month  can anybody tell me what be the system for a newcomer on   driving license    is it that one have to pass a rigorous drive test and then he be ussied a drving license for a fee even though he possess a driving license of his home country  rgds asd  
i think it depend on where your original driver license be from  i think people from the states  uk  south africa  canada and probably others can just convert there old license to a local qatar driving license  you just need to do an eye test  
get an international dr lic before you come  it will be good till you get your rp and a qatari lic 
is any member of this site be work with qp  how be their work culture  rgds asd  india 
hi folks  i be start work in doha in august and i be wonder if anyone know if it be possible to transfer my uae license to a qatar one  my canadian license have long since expire  but i have be on my uae license for the past 5 year  i would rather not deal with the hassle of redo my canada license this summer  but i bet it would be simple than do the qatari drive exam  anyone have any experience with this  cheers  
i be not sure about people from the uk asthey be drive on the left hand side of the road  however  there be other ex pats here who be drive they will probably know about it  i convert mine from the uae a i ca n t find my european license and that go no bother at all  
first of all you have to get your residence permit  afterwhich you can apply for a qatar drive license  if you already have a driving license from your country  take note that most of the western country they will just convert it  no need for you to take up the test or go to a driving school  if your license be from asia  it depend  but most of the asian license you have to undergo a driving test  signal  l and pocket parking  road test  or the traffice department will suggest on your application form to go to a driving school for two week  hope this help

working in qatar medical exam on arrival in doha hi i have be tell by my employer we all have to have a medical exam prior to commence employment in doha  what do this involve  do anyone know  i have be tell i can have mine the day i arrive and then start work 2 day after i be interested to know what exactly they test for  anyone know  is this a usual thing in qatar  thanks s 
shay  yes  it s usual  and it s no big deal  a blood test  an xray  and a blood typing  that s about it   then  of course  there s the full palm fingerprinting  well  ok  it s really only the finger  but they tend to be a bit careless and messy     eta  but no  sorry  do n t know exactly what they test for  but definitely hiv  hepatitis  
thank you loki thats very interest  do they test for std cause they be worried about people bring those disease into the country  
 also they want   healthy   worker  the quicker you get these test do  the good since they be require in order for your residence permit  etc  to be process   
i guess so  but do n t really know much about it  sorry  do n t know what would happen if a test come back positive  i can only assume that there would be some implication for the residency work permit  
hi qatari  thats what i dont understand  why dont they make you do the test before you leave your own country  dont i have have to have a resident permit with my visa before i leave to come to doha  
 i know someone who do n t   pas   the test  he have tb  i think  he be send back home and of course  do n t get the job  your contract will say that the job will be terminate if you do n t succesfully pass the health check  it be scary  but try not to think about it too much  or get yourself check in australia before hand for your peace of mind   
 you just get a visa from your employer  they then get you a residence permit    iqamah    that go into your passport  it take a whole page and contain an id number    
perhaps because they want them do by their own doctor  as oppose to trust some random piece of paper that they think could be forge    dunno   
cool  thanks for your help everybody  i dont have anything to worry about  i be just curious a to the process and reason behind it     besides i hate blood test  but ya get that    cheers s 
i be so worried when i have my test  in the past i have do volunteer work with baby and child sick with aids  you know  change nappy  clean bruise and dry tear   of course you know that you can not possibly get infected if precaution be take  and it never bother me before  but i get worried anyway when we come here  could n t help it

advice and help qatar airways v emirates hello  i m plan to take a long flight in a couple of month  both qa and emirates have flight go my way  which be well  which airline would you book  thanks in advance  
which way do you go  i know emirates soon will have doha  new castle direct  start in september   that will be our next flight for our next travel back to the uk which be handy for avoid heathrow security check  i be not too keen with qa  give me emirates anytime  never have any luck with qa  i think we be jinxed travel with them lol  
 simply becoz i work for them  hee haw    no really  if you re go to dc  then you re good off take the qr flight coz we fly there non stop and the aircraft be the a340 600 which be a beauty to fly in  especially if you re fly the premium class  even if it be economy  the pitch in between the seat be so much good than ek  if you re fly to ny  then i think ek go there direct  coz we fly to newark  ewr  viz geneva  on the a330  which be also a good aircraft to fly in  hell yeh  all qr aircraft be good to fly in you know why    coz we take you more personally     and i m say that with a straight face    
you could n t be serious eh   p my flight back here from jakarta their intertainment flight do not work  last may our flight from heathrow to doha be cancel  last year in march both incoming and outgo flight to amman delayed  told ya  our flight with qa be jinxed    ps  you will have to ask pay rise for the extra promotion you do for qa  
oh it qatar airways hand down for me  just imagine what would have happen to so many people who be now happily marry and well settle  and many many more have potential to do so in future too   have n t it be for qatar airways    colt  be n t your wife plain happy or what to have a good half a a qatar airways employee                         1200 ql points    yay  way to go ray                       www e4u name qa 
i ca n t remember last when i fly with emirates  oh yes  it be to and fro jo burg last august  i lose 2 piece of out 3 baggage that i have check in  their staff in doha be so crappy that they do n t know what to answer me  all they have to say be dxb be a very busy station and such thing tend to happen  i be like yeah fine  but be that what you will keep say to rest of 9 family stand here with me     lol contrastingly  and i be be very true here  i have n t face a single problem with qatar airways flight for as long a i could remember  last i can remember have a problem on qr be perhaps with food or something 3 year back  one a much important note  i have n t have any luck with any ek crew yet  sadly                         1200 ql points    yay  way to go ray                       www e4u name qa 
hell yeh  i have seriously to ask the sale dept  for my cut on the promotion im do on their behalf  hey sorry if you guy be jinxed with qr  but really the crew service etc be much good than ek  coz i know for a fact that the ek crew dun give a damn bout service  they will be like yeh will get you that when i m here next and you re like wait  regd you jakarta trip  i think we fly the a300 aircraft there and those aircraft s be be convert into freighter  coz they be kinda old  lhr doh  cancel  why  i m sure there be a reason for that and you would have be compensate  not that it be any consolation  and amm trip  well delay be a part of the airport expansion during that time  so dun you think i deserve a good bonus this year   if they have hear of anything like that   lol    ray  let s not talk bout the wifey  she use to fly with qr competitor at one point in time and when i join qr  i ask her to come and fly with u  she simply refus   
i guess your flight with emirates be jinx in the contrary of mine lmao  i witness qa cancellation in london  and it be in total chaos  there be no organization at all  5 staff stand up in the counter  but 4 of them have no idea what to do  keep point out to an arab look guy for sort out  poor guy look so streessed out try to sort all the passenger  
yeh i fly joberg from dubai like 2 year ago when we be start there and i be upgrade to businesss class  but i can really tell you that qr economy class service on these long haul flight be good than the ek j class service  besides  they always mishandle baggage coz they have a minimum connecting time of i think 1 5 hour  so if your connect anytime less than that  youu can rest assure  your baggage wo n t ride the flight you re in  so not the case with qr  
the only plausible reason would be that those 4 guy be not qr staff but the ground handling staff and hence they must have be point to the qr staff  kinda happen in most place  the handle company will always refer you to the airline  anyways  i m not make excuse for their lapse  but hope you have a good journey the next time you fly qr  holla me and i will ensure you get treat well     
 now thats what we call    taking you more personally    lol but yes  i kinda agree with novita that qr flight be delay on most occassions  even the crew friend of mine laugh about it cos they ca n t really commit to what time their arrival back in doha would be at  to catch up on a party  a movie or something                       1200 ql points    yay  way to go ray                       www e4u name qa  
sightseeing and tourist attraction is an electric guitar allow to be hand carry in the plane  q217 
hell  pls  say yes

i have carry a manual guitar with me  only hand baggage   you could try pack the attachment on to your luggage  and the guitar part with you in hand luggage  on a quick thought  why do n t you just call up the airway helpline and get it query 
i always hand carry my electric guitar in a soft case  if the overhead compartment can not accommodate your guitar  ask one of plane staff to place it on their locker   peace out 
1 guitar a handcarry be not a problem  did this before  
i carry an electronic guitar in nov2008 on my tour trip to kuala lampur  also  i carry it along with me  from kuala lampur to bangkok  all the way back from bangkok to qatar    so  i atleast guarantee with my experience that there shouldnt be any problem  rest be your luck    bad time never knock at your door before entering      d

advice and help bringing alcohol chocolates out of qatar  hello  i will be soon take a vacation  back to the united states  i recently purchase some delicious alcohol chocolate  from qdc  is it legal for me to put these chocolate in my checked baggage  to bring back to the united states  
u could buy liquor carry choc from qatar  then who could have problem in take it out to us  what a question  
should n t be a problem  except if it get warm on the tarmac your chocolate will melt inside your bag  mandi 
why cant you take it from airport duty free  
you may only buy such thing in the duty free upon departure  transporting alcohol in this manner be illegal  
technically you should n t  but no one will check your outgoing baggage  it s only what you bring in to the country that anyone care about  
you can carry alcohol chocolate  not a problem  in check in luggage  i purchase some form the dubai duty free  bring them to doha and carry them to the us  
thank you very much  everyone  for your reply  i appreciate the information that you all have provide  
they will not be check if the chocolate you carry be with or without alcohol  
from what i know  you ca n t bring any foreign food into the us  but i may be wrong  although i have see many people who have their food take away by custom in the us  well check to make sure  
no clue  i doubt there be any check at the airport  that airport be in such a messy condition anyhow  slow check in  long line at passport control  full departure hall  people sit on the floor  filthy toilet      
visas and permits criminal charge prevent departure from qatar  my friend have accuse one of his employee of theft  this employee be now in the deportation centre on salwa road  can my friend leave the country or be he bar from leave the country until they both appear in court  how can my friend find out if this be true  without try to leave   
your friend can apply for exit permit  he be free to travel if his exit permit approve  simple  
pretty sure if there be a court case pending  there be a block on your passport and you wo n t be able to leave until the court case be clear  
your friend be the complainant and not the theft  right  he should be allow to leave and travel outside the country  but if there be a court appointment during his her absence and fail to attend  that would be a lost point for your friend and a credit to the theft  possibility be  without the complainant or witness during court session  the judge might cancel the case and drop down your friend s complains     think about it  
not true  i know some people who travel even when they have a pending court case  you be free to travel if you be not black list  only way to find out be to apply for an exit permit  that will tell you  
 quote    not true  i know some people who travel even when they have a pending court case  you be free to travel if you be not black list  only way to find out be to apply for an exit permit  that will tell you      are your comment an answer to my post or to frankyj  and of coarse  anyone can travel and leave if their name be not blacklist in the immigration system  and accord to baedebook  his friend be the complainant not the theft  definitely his friend be not blacklist   
i comment in general 
 issue an exit permit you can leave even with a pending court case  infact your company may   encourage   you to leave because it unlikely any court case will go in your favour  it have happen as long a the exit permit be issue    just load up the excess baggage and get out quick    
small correction here  eng  avid   your company can issue you an exit permit  but you will still be block by the immigration at the airport during departure  when your name be blacklist in the system  if you know that you have previous police case  ex  return cheque   obtain exit permit do n t mean that your name be clear from the system  you must follow up w  the capital police after 6 months from the date you settle your case to remove the blacklist of your name in the immigration airport  
apple i be not argue with you  my pro say when they apply for exit permit it will be direct to interior ministry for endorsement  if there be anything against you  your exit permit will be reject by the system  it be computerise and we be apply for all our immigration requirement through on line  to clear the black listing you need to go to public procrcutor s office  niyama  and settle your penalty   near city centre  and the public procecutors office can clear your record within short time if you aooroch them with your lawyer  this be what our lawyer say  
you get good point  and neither i m not argue w  you  i be give you an example of a police case  ex  return cheque   coz this be the common case that can happen to anyone  if your case be file at capital police  you need to clear your name from there  if it be a court case then you should go to niyaba  mostly  the case be to be file from the police dept  then forward to the court for settlement depend on both the plaintiff  the suspect agreement  another example be if your bank file a complaint against you to the capital police for not pay your debt  car loan  credit card  personal loan   then your name will be blacklist in the system till you settle your account  accordingly  only after 6 months from the date of your settlement before your name be remove from the blacklist  what i m try to imply here be  if you know that you have previous but settled criminal or civil case  nothing wrong to clear your name  follow up at the place where the charge agains   
qatar living lounge al maha service can we book for al maha service on the day of arrival  i mean few hr before arrival  i know we can do it online  but some of them be say that no guarantee for online booking  my mom be come first time in the new arrival area  she be arrive tomorrow morning mom can understand english  but cant talk much  she be on business class  do you think she will be able to manage herself  
the ground staff or the cop around will surely help her out  
she will be able to manage herself  and yes you can book al maha service few hr before the arrival of flight  just go to the al maha desk and provide full name and flight number of your mother and they will take care of it  wishing your mom a pleasent stay in doha  
ok thank you guy  i will check with mom if she will manage if not  i will take their service    
yes  you can book al maha only few hour before arrival  you will have to go to the airport for booking  
it s good to take their service  your mum would n t have to que or wait for anything  they will clear everything and escort your mum  my experience they be fast and good  all the best   
go to the sale center in the arrival terminal  talk to the sale staff there  almaha only take booking prior to 24 hour of the flight  how ever depend on the work load they have a chance of accept your booking  yet you might have to pay a sum of qr 300 00 extra to the normal service fee  i too agree with khanan  she will be able to proceed her self if you be able of instruct her on how to  make sure you give her clear instruction  if she be a bit old  ask her to hire a porter for just qr 20 00  porter counter be locate to the left once you enter the baggage area  it will give you a porter ticket enable her to hire a porter  which  the porter will locate the bag for her  bring her to you  if you wish to you can tip the porter with another additional amount of your choice  i dont see any point of u waste about 500 600qr when you can get the work do just in 20qr  30qr  all the best  wish your mom a pleasant stay in doh  
well to use the service orelse it might take much time for her to cum out specially if she be on visit visa  
people of 80 year old  more under visit visa clear through immigration  custom check  baggage area without any hassle  one should only fear only if they have issue with their visa  regardless of what visa type a passenger hold  ask your mom to keep her passport  ticket copy  if available   visa copy ready before she proceed to the immigration area counter  instruct her on where exactly you live in doh a the immigration staff may require these information  i personally know people who clear by them self before almaha do  i bet she can clear by her self  dont waste your money  give your mom some quality time with that money which you be plan to spend on this service which you be look at  
what a way to let people know that u can afford a business class ticket  p  just kiddin  yes  she can manage herself a definitely there will be many asians to help her out  
lol business class later book economy clas haha 
moving to qatar tata sky can anyone advise me about bring a tata sky decoder into doha  i be plan to bring one  will it be confiscate  i be not travel with family this time   
even i be plannin to bring one here  wud like to have more info on that  i do check out their website  it just say u can take it anywhere in india   no mention abt abroad  
i be not worry on indian custom  will it be confiscate in doha  can anyone share your experience  ofcourse the succesful one  of bring in the decoder  
   make a difference or make way   they sure be get confiscate in uae  try your luck in doha  
hey just bring it in a laptop bag  so while go to india take an empty laptop bag  come back with the reciever in that bag  no1 will open it think it a laptop 
i do n t think so the custom at doha will stop you for the tatasky box  however please remember it be restrict for use within india  
 but do not forget it be illegal    i write this so that they dont prosecute me for tell you how to break the law    
bring a decoder be very easy  just buy a tata sky in india and get it installed and activate there  after use it in india for 3 4 day just get the receiver  the remote and the decoder with u get in contact with any dish technician  he will install it here  he take about 700 800 rial for it  i have get one and it running successfully  
there be restaurents in qatar be use tata sky openly  it be illegal in india to take it out of indian territory  i agree  my question be  what about in doha  be it illegal  
it illegal in doha btw dont be like a sheep i e  if one sheep jump off a cliff the others all follow so be warn if catch it your funeral  img nid 50852 title hmm desc link none align left width height 0  
chances be that it might be confisticated in airport the u take it will definately use it in his house    hahaa  but remeber to hide the smart card for tatasky decoder so even if it take away atleast the other person wont be able to use it    
qatar living lounge no duty free alcohol into doha    when do they change that rule

moving to qatar doha airport immigration lineup             came to doha two day ago and must have wait nearly an hour to get through the immigration lineup at the airport  why do n t they have more staff  why do n t they have a more efficient system  the bad i ve see anywhere  
yeah if there be multiple flight then definitely there be queue  i believe this issue will be address in the new doha international airport  so till then keep your finger cross and hope for the best  ilu qatar 
the worst   seems u never be to other airport   try to visit london heathrow or australia  dude  it be normal when the airport receive multiple flight  
do you miss something  
qatari55 doha be by far and away the worst airport i ve visit  multiple flight or not  the wait time be pathetic  ususally with only half the station man  if you be lucky  been to aussie and heathrow many time and never have the wait time even remotely close to the dopy doha airport  
you just land and already moaning  
next time try to get a business class seat and u will be treat vip lol  0   be patient  
firstly  anybody that think doha be bad ca n t have travel very much  it s nothing compare to place like miami  newark  jfk or trinidad  i ve often wait three hour at imigration in those airport  secondly  get yourself a new electronic residency card and you ll breeze straight through  
keep e gate card   so u may come out as soon a kick off from the plan lol 
it s not the shortage of staff that s the problem  it s get the one who be there to get off their phone that s the problem  i hate it when they ca n t be civil and just sit there yabering on with their phone on hand free  ahhhhh   i feel well now i have have a mini rant this morning   
thank god for the e gate card now 
moving to qatar what should i ship what should i purchase out there  this post do what it say on the tin  any advice  i m come from the uk  what kind of thing should i be think about shipping  what stuff should i leave behind and buy when i get out there  thank you or should i start practise and say shukran  now   o  
if you have a use it or lose it kind of deal with your relocation allowance bring as much a you can  you wo n t have to spend as much on setup when you get here  bringing your favourite stuff will make it seem more like home here  bringing a car be probably not a good idea  
that s the thing margaret  i ve be offer a reasonable shipping allowance  it seem such a waste though  financially and moreover environmentally   to ship the basic practical stuff  i m not particularly attach to things  in any event  my most favourite thing be my friend and my memory  i ca n t ship my friend over in a tea chest  although some may come to visit  and my memory be mostly in my head  although some be also record in photo form  and i would n t want to entrust my most dearly love photo to a shipping company  i ve never be particularly materialistic and so my favourite stuff  amount to a few trinket and thing buy on my travel  shoe  but i m go to limit myself a to how many pair i bring over  because i want to  and can  travel light   i particularly like a lamp  a few picture and painting  my le creuset pan  although they be so stupidly heavy i would n t dream of ship them half way across the world   i can live without those thoug   
pack a skype phone for make long distance call back home use skype    far cheap than qtel  we come we saw we be qatarized 
our shipping allowance go on our dog     the whole of it go in one go  serious we go through such a nightmare ship item  we pack about twenty box full of dvd  clothes  and book  then it take about six month to come though custom  we bring our tv over but that get broken  serious i would take as little a you can with you  book yes the decent one be so hard to find out here  dvds if you watch them yes  clothes for sure  other bit id say no  there amazing furniture  kitchen bit  bathroom bit out here you can get anything you need  sentimental thing  i would say no purely becuase they might get lose on there way over  photo and such for sure  letter for sure but the big thing no  i really wish we have bring with u half of what we do  we bring too much stuff  we have accumulate even more and when we move on i hate to think how many box we will have to pack  try and pack as little a you can you can get anything out here excpet good book  hope this he   
blankets  during the uk summer i find even the light duvet be too warm and i prefer to use a cotton waffle blanket  friends who have live in the middle east advise me that with the air conditioning i would need a duvet here  they be wrong  we keep our air co at 25 degree and i miss my blanket  i ca n t find cotton waffle blanket here  only nasty fleece one  the choice of duvet cover be n t too good either  too expensive or too tacky  especially since bh go up in smoke  it get pretty cold in the winter  bring an electric fire  plastic food container be generally of poor quality and you need to keep dry food seal up or the bug will get in  
thank you for your suggestion so far  they re really useful   the truth  i be plan on bring as little a possible anyway  but i would n t have think about a skype phone  thanks the truth    charm  luckily  charm  i do n t have a dog  i do have a cat but i have to re home her about two year ago when i go to france for a few month  and the length of time it take to clear stuff be the other problem  even if i do want to ship some practical household item  i would surely have buy some replacement by the time my own be ship and clear custom   squarepeg  blankets  that s an interesting point  squarepeg  i mostly have duvet and throw at home  but i might get some blanket  do the a c unit work a heater too  i recall that when i live overseas before  the a c unit also work a heater  do they have similar unit in doha  i do n t think i ll ship an electric fire but i ll probably bring my hot water bottle  thanks  and bug  how big be these bug  s   
also  be it possible to use the shipping allowance  on excess baggage charge on a flight out there  instead of be reimburse for ship it through a shipping company  
i do n t see many bug  so i store some dry food in plastic bag with the top roll over  i be in the uk for a couple of month in the summer and when come back i find weevil in the flour  rice etc  i throw it away and invest in some plastic container with good seal  have n t notice any bug in the kitchen since  to be honest  i ve have more problem with ant in the uk than i ve have with bug here  here  we have a bug man who come and spray around the house onece a month  there s an early thread on this subject somewhere in the archive  i think  i think i m right in say that a c unit here generally do n t also work a heater  certainly in our house they just cool  
you can but the phone and headset here  they be recommend make by skype  as for heater  i have to buy 2 just to get through the winter  despite be a hardy scot lass my house be like the artic  good luck with the move  
you can get most everything here  bring the thing that make it feel like home  there be some thing that can be way more expensive  such a sheet  toilet item  etc  do n t bring electronics except your laptop  remember everything you bring will have to be ship again or sell when you leave  
at night   what s the club scene in doha  i leave a cool lifestyle in mumbai for little more money and i m stuck here  i hear about liquor licence  qdc n all  i ll be get my id this week after that i can go for that  but apart from that can anybody tell me what the nightlife available here  how much i need to spend  where be the place etc etc

dont go to the park at night  let alone take the child  bad habit  the maximum until 9 pm  bring the family in the morning  see the rise sun  fresh air  good for health  peace 
yes citycenter parkinglot    p 
al rayyan park  near al rayyan village or sports roundabout  it s very big  green and exquisite   
facific  be right  early morning outing for the park and beach be extremely enjoyable  
i live in al sadd and yes  there be no near park within the area too bad for kid  i hope there be something like that in the middle of al sadd  maybe they can convert the parking lot beside lulu to a park    hope so  
thanks everyone for your helpful comment  i ll try go to aspire park  cheers

advice and help digging noise at night  aaaaarrrrrgh  i be sit here at almost half past midnight with my whole house shake from jackhammering outside  can anyone tell me whether there be a legal time limit to the lateness you can do construction work in this country  
ahem  legal what  
if he can do it  so can the construction worker  p on a more serious note  during the very hot weather i do n t know what other option the builder have but to work at night  
 the national past time of qatar  digging  happens anywhere at any time of the day  as long a they be dig they be happy     to be or not to be  that be the question    
we have suffer for year with the digger and the noisy machine all night long  i even go out and tap it think some official would care but my husband say their be no noise law  our new house have be shake so much we have major glass break a the house shook    welcome to qatar the land of the rudest people on earth 
 we have same experience 3 time over more 2 year in our area  oh  make it 4  this time it right beside our villa  and the owner happen to be a uniformed gentleman  if you know what i mean   waah  as the old wise say go     what to do     
well  i remember this happen around my place last year  my dad have to literally go out and shout at them  u can just get the supervisor s contact number from those worker and speak to him regard this  they be actually not permit to work in residential area at odd hour  23 00hrs  5 00hrs   just speak to him and tell him it not tolerable since u have school go kid at home and if it continue then u would complain to the high authority  good luck    
maybe if you could establish that noise be really a pollution  maybe the environment and health department would be the best to call  not sure  
eve may i ask you shout this  qatar the land of the rudest people on earth  why do you live here then  do someone force you to live here  greg i have the killer driller go for 5 week  cause structual damage to our building and my brain  
   eve may i ask you shout this  qatar the land of the rudest people on earth  why do you live here then  do someone force you to live here    that be the most infuriating remark that i keep hear from people in qatar at the slight criticism  yes of course it be unbelievable that human wellbeing be disregard to an extent that people be deprive of sleep at night  i agree with eve  this be really really rude   
slightest criticism   rude people on earth that be most definately not a slight  criticism  that be a sweeping statement

politics convert and marry in islam doubt can someone tell me how many witness be need when convert and could my love be a witness  she s morroquian  do i have to change name  in wedding  best father mother have to be muslim  thanksing in advance 4 useful info  
you should n t convert to islam just because you want to marry a muslim girl  it be n t right  at all  you should practice it and be convince of the faith before jump into it  think with your brain platao36  you be only fool yourself  
you need two male witness and no you dont have to change your name  and no for the last  plato since in your previous post you say you be attend a mosque for information and phamplets about islam  it probably a good idea to ask all these question there a well  
i agree honestpedal  especially since in most of the post plato seem to have a lot of issue with islam belief  conflict with his belief  yes i know it for your love  but hey  it must be tough  personally i wouldnt do it  your partner should accept you for who you be and it a shame her parent beliefs opnions be more important than yours  i guess each to their own  
the reason behind most non muslims who have convert be only to marry a muslim girl  they know that they can not have her any other way  unless she sin  and not all do  yes she should accept the man for who he be and for what he believe in  but u a muslim females  we be restrict to standard and we can not change them  its too complicate to discuss  but good luck  take more time to learn islam and maybe the faith in allah will grow in your heart  not for her  the girl friend  but for allah himself  
before you get marry to a morrocan 
  then we ll tell platao to stop think morocco girlfriend and portugal    everything in this book may be wrong    illusions  the adventures of the reluctant messiah by richard bach  
platao  you do not need any witness to become a muslim  it be as simple a knowing and pronounce the shahadatain with the correct intention  they call it the american dream because you have to be asleep to see it   george carlin 
my mistake amcm  i be mistakenly think of marriage  
honest pedal  who say most non muslims revert to marry muslim woman  you should be more careful before you make blanket statement like that  the majority of reverts who i have come into contact with  myself include  accept islam after study not to get married     ibrahim fletcher 
i have live my life for a full  over 25 year  and i have meet too many who have convert for be with a woman  i do not point finger at anyone  so i do n t think you should be sensitive about anything that i say  in arabic we say  ilkhair yikhis  ou ilshar yi 2im  which mean   the good be of one  the bad be generalize    i hope that be understood  good luck and allah yahdi man yasha2  
qatar living lounge who be these girl  who would n t like to meet her  i find this advert on qatarliving home page  but    is n t there something fishy about this  are these real girl  i would like some opinion  
since all female specimen in doha even remotely resemble the subject show above be either marry or engage  and it be blasphemous to think about date someone already marry or engage to someone else in qatar  i think it would be a good idea to make the advert more realistic  so here it be  
well groom men get the best of the lot  
dont try to date online  get a life   
it s a fixed set of girl  photo and they plug in the name of the country you re in  some of these ad be even more specific  i saw some ad say that they re in some uninhabited remote area of qatar  they probably have a list of cities villages   
thanks for the info bleu  
lol edifis   
i have a very hearty morning laugh today   thank you all 
could these girl be inside the pearl qatar   or say the megamart  
 great photoshop edifis and appropriate theme  lol dating sit all seem to be control by the same hold group  just the web address be different  the page layout  photograph etc be the same  just by the access person s ip address they change the country in the advertisement  so a to attract a click  it all end up the same   pay by creditcard paypal money transfer    my hypothesis be that  there be actually two world while we male dwell in one  lot and lot of beautiful girl seem to be spending time in loneliness in some other world  somewhere out there  my plan be just to stay alive till the time the two world meet

qatar living lounge is ql now the rizks and pajju show  it seem to me that every topic be now get hijack by rizks and pajju  im all for a bit of hijack  cos it can lead to other discussion  but these two clown just destroy every topic into a stupid dim witted conversation about bollox  c mon guy  just dont hijack to get point  please add some idea and thought into the chosen topic  
 no comment on that one a sometimes im guilty of hijacking  but mind you  only   sometimes   ha  and i be actually try my best to avoid it from now on a there have be some user lately who get kick out for this reason    please add some idea and thought into the chosen topic     i agree with you on that one mp   
and they have a new queen   i hear  these two girl above me would know who it be  
most of the time  hijack shift the main topic to a different one and then to another different one and so on   
i understand your point alexa  some thread reach up to 3 or so page and when you look at it  i think only the first page stay on the main topic  
come on guys  they be not that bad  be they   emad   
 it just end up a load of old cobbler  and the true meaning of the topic be lose  then people see it  and get feed up of posting    a man may fight for many things his country  his friend  his principle  the glisten tear on the cheek of a golden child  but personally  i d mud wrestle my own mother for a ton of cash  an amusing clock and a sackful of porn    blackadder   
well i do agree  they even hijack a thread i be consider seriously  but  what can we tell them to do   emad   
   2  hijacking  a  there be issue raise to u on serious hijacking of thread  though the question may have be answer or you know the person who post the thread  it be not acceptable to hijack any thread  unless it have be announce in the beginning a a hijack thread  the reason be that the question may be important to most reader and the essence of the topic be lose due to serious hijacking  hijacking defeat the purpose of our mission of information dissemination  b  i know most of u  include me  still have the hang over from our successful christmas party  victory party and birthday party  however  we should not use this   high   to hijack each and every thread open from then    hinay hinay   lang because most other readers members can not relate to them and sometimes personal joke can be read a demeaning  immoral and indecent by others who can not relate  and this do n t reflect well on the group  as i have say what you write leave an impression of you on th    
maybe if they start to hijack less threads    emad   
to ease up a bit on the hijack maybe

 your question remembers me when one person tell me    i dont understand  when i be in spain nobody speak nothing but spanish  but when i find a spanish in a foreign country they speak english  let leave aside quality     this be the same  what do you want to find in qatar  people with islamicphobia  this ppl remain at home     you will only find here people able to accept deal with the cultural difference  war look for peace  be like fornication look for virginity

 i hate that word  it s not even a real word  to deconstruct it  it mean a fear of islam not a hatred of islam  the word get it root from homophobia  another ridiculous word a it literally mean fear of the same   anyone who logically disagree and question the idea and precept in islam be target with this word  it be design to appear that this questioning be in some way display a hatred towards islam and muslims  sorry it s a bug bear of mine  peace   deaths in the bible  god  2  270  365 not include the victim of noah s flood  sodom and gomorrah  or the many plague  famine  fiery serpent  etc because no specific number be give  satan  10

qatar living lounge filippancy at al ahli hospital i have an appointment at al ahli dermatology department schedule for 1 20 pm today  as i arrive on time  i be tell to wait for half an hour a the doctor leave for his lunch break  without care about his patient  i cancel the appointment and leave the hospital  is it a fair treatment  your comment please  
sadly doctors here feel that they be far too superior to care about patient  
do u think cancel appointmnt be the solution  u should have to complain  which u do not  
specially consider the kind of money we pay over there for consultancy  but not something unheard of never have such an experience at al ahli though i ve go through similar situation elsewhere whilst i applaud you for stand your ground  know me though i d probably have wait depend on my queue wait number  
this be common problem a this hospital  i have hear of people wait more than 1 hour for scheduled appointment  scheduling the appointment be often difficult and disorganize also  hopefully if enough complain they will improve  but best solution be for new private hospital to open to create competition  
doctor leave  maybe he just leave for he attend a patient before you  better he be not hungry while treat you rather than  you know  anyhow  set another appointment and if it be still the same  complain  do n t just go  
i have fill suggestion form and put in the box before leave al ahli  i be consider to visit hamad hospital instead  good to have choice  
doctors in hospital here go for lunch break  prayer break etc  and since that be the case  maybe the best solution would be to schedule patient accordingly   mind you  long wait time be normal for doctor s visit the world over  
 did you not ask for the doctor s schedule for that day  maybe your definition of   appointment   be contacting asking information desk whether this that doctor have clinic today without ask his her exact schedule  well  most of the doctor here be incompetent for their title and most of the time would cause more trouble to you   
sorry can you explain the title  
please let u know  if al ahli respond back to your suggestion form  because my experience be that they have a lousy customer service and be not interested in follow up on the complaint  do remember that all unit of hamad hospital do not have a strict appointment system  you just go there early and take the token and wait for your turn  it can take half and hour to almost an hour and half to see the doctor

socialising queen dental or sr sarah s    im torn between the two  i need to do my crown before the year end  i want something that be worth the price help  i dunno if this be the right place to post this thanks  
go to ahli hospital 
thanks darude im also consider that  who s your dentist there  u familiar with dr rabab jaber  
dr  sarah s be my dentist  they be good  but they be also very good at extract money out of your bank account  no problem with the service  but i will always moan about the price  
dentist dont remember her name be year ago 
just wan na know if dr sarah be your doctor there  cuz when i make an appointment they recommend me dr thomas but im kind of hesitant though i try to make an appointment with dr sarah herself but her schedule be full til the 16th of december   
go to dr hassan alabdulla medical center d ring old airoport they r very good dentist 
no i have never be in the chair with dr  sarah herself  and i do n t remember the name of the lovely  lovely lady who extract my money  
thanks ill keep that in mind  
as with everything  good dentistry cost good money mate  but look at it a buy a good product that will last you a while but cost more vs  a crap product that wo n t last you very long  wo n t function the way it ought to but cost le  ask around with friend  colleague  a to which of the above be good  more value for money  also about other well known practice in the country  btw  the fact that a dentist s scehdule be full for the next 10 day be a good sign  so i do n t see what you re upset about  a dentist that you can see tomorrow be obviously not see that many patient  be n t a popular right   do the math mate    
i go to dr thomas at dr sarah s and she be really good  i have significant dental issue and have spend many hour in a dental chair so i know what i be talk about  she be very gentle  very good at explain thing  i ca n t comment on the cost a my employer cover it     but i would pay for her myself if i have to 
socialising  mri scan at hamad hosp  anyone know how that work  apparently i need a referral from my doctor  i m new here so i be not quiet sure who   my doctor   be  then i need an appointment with the doctor at hamad hospital  and he decide if i need one  otherwise i have to pay around 1000qr at a private hospital  which be very expensive  suggestions please   
i think you would need to get a referral from your phc doctor that be a doctor from your own phc  basically you would need to have a health card of hmc to have your phc ap 
who ask you to go for an mri  that doctor can give a referral for hamad hospital  request a mri  appointment can take upto a month  i do n t think it s necessary for the phc dr to give a referral or that you need to check again with a dr at hamad  i have a referral once directly from a private clinic for an mri  but rule change  you can check with the dr you be follow up your problem with  ask him or her for a referral and then go to hamad hospital x ray mri unit and check about the appointment  they be usually helpful  and if they appear uncooperative  please complain since their customer service take such thing seriously  but i do n t think you will get such a problem  their staff be usually helpful  sometimes it can take more than 3 staff member to give you the right picture but they will try and help you and guide you  
may allah give you good health  in order to get any service from hmc  you need a health card  alongwith the health card  go with your private doctor mri referral to the main hmc mri section or al rumaila mri section ang get the appointment  so simple  best regard  
secure a health card if you have not do so already by visit the health center of your area with a pp size photograph and qr 100   of course you need to be an rp holder to be eligible  it might take a couple of day or even more to be with you  with that in hand visit your local health center again and see any gp with your complains  let him refer you to some specialist in hamad relate to your complain  take an appointment of the specialist in hamad  if luck be by your side and depend on the specialization you have be refer to  it might take somewhere between 1 to 6 month before you could see the specialist  last time when i be there to take an appointment for even clinic  not free even with health card   i be tell that the appointment system itself be be upgrade and no appointment be possible until january next year  so watch out  now if you be really lucky and you get to see the specialist and he feel that you need an mri scan do  he will issue you a paper   
hi flexicode  you can see a doctor at hamad without go through the health centre  i have have two appointment with different doctor and one for my family member  by directly ask for an appointment ofcourse you do n t get the appt immediately  depend upon the doctor  some specialist be available within a week s time  while renowned consultant have a std wait period of 45 day  miss that appt and the next one be after another 45 days grrrr  downside of wait to meet a consultant be that if he be on a casual leave on the day of the appointment  they do n t inform you and some junior dr will see you  beat the point of actually take an appt with a consultant and then wait to see him  it help if you have a referral and a referral by a private dr should be fine too  most important be to have a health card  once you have apply  they issue you a receipt  you can use the hospital service with the receipt  
i must add that they keep change their rule so one month you can get an appt over the phone and the next month they would ask you to go to the phc first for a different appt  moreover get an mri do outside could cost almost 1500 or more  depend upon the area be scan  but it depend on how worried you be about your condition  and the cost be nothing  you get your result quickly  but if you can wait  it good to get into the national health care system  it not costly  and let them take care of you  hope you feel well soon  
firstly thank you all for the quick and informative response  nobody have actually asked me to get an mri  but i want to do it myself a i be worried about my back  my low back have be ache me for about 2 week now  and yesterday the upper right side of my back start hurting  i visit a doctor and he instantly tell me that it be not a slipped disc  and be just a muscle spasm a the pain do n t extend to my leg  though i still want to be certain a i want to start work out again  but i do n t want to mess with my back if i should n t  and he say the upper back pain be also normal  and not relate to a slipped disc whatsoever  thanks again  
hello  sad to hear about your back pain  your dr be right  if your pain be not extend to your limb and be not feel any pain or numbness in your finger or toe  foot  then you do n t need to worry  it s possible that you have injure yourself during your workout or be due to your work position  the way you sit at your desk  the way you sit while drive etc  slip disc would give you excruciate pain  even simple task can become difficult  i be not sure if slip disc be the same a disc bulge  but in a disc bulge  if it start touch the nerve  then you can have crazy tingle pain  you can try ask for an appointment with a dr arun at hamad hospital in the evening clinic  or try to meet him at alkhor hospital  he be available in doha only on tuesday the other day  he be in alkhor waiting time can be long  because he quite seek after  you can also meet dr bhat at doha clinic  he be one of the best and a longtimer in doha  i would advice you to refrain from weight training   
hey han19  thank you so much for the reply  and the advice  i feel so much good know that it hopefully most likely be not a slipped disc  being so young  and have start a new career  it would really not be a good thing  i have stop weight train completely for now which suck  but do you think it would be a good idea to introduce it very mildly  you think jog be okay  i want to meet a proper doctor  even if at a private hospital  a the guy at hamad be busy  and only barely give me any advice  i be sure a proper doctor can give me advice a to how exactly the right position be to sleep  to sit  etc  maybe can give me some exercise to do to help me recover faster  you know any doctor  even at a private hospital you specifically would recommend  these problem be to do with the radiology section be that right  forgive me a i know very little about hospital and such problem  a i have have very few problem in the past  touch wood   thank you again 
hi hmd  i would not advice you to do any strength training till you back pain subsides  are you a heavy person  brisk walking be prefer to jog a in jogging you be put a lot of impact on your low back  as well a our knee  if you be a heavy person then you shuld try to avoid jog n skipping brisk walk be great again body posture be important  the stomach muscle support the back  so you need to firm up our stomach  a good physiotherapist can suggest some basic exercise  especially for the back and they really help  they be very simple  if you be into exercise u should know the cobra posture  cat stretch  simple leg lift while lie down  for sit position try to google office ergonomics and they usually have a standard picture that show how one should be seat at an office desk  wile drive  if you drive long distance  you need to move your neck frequently  you may call doha clinic hospital  and ask for dr  bhat  he be very good and his treatment be usuall

qatar living lounge where to buy a good heater for the house  hello can anyone suggest where to buy a good heater for the house  we   39  re planning to put it in our bedroom  and if there   39  s a good brand you know  pls feel free to suggest  thanks  
hashmi room heater available in lulu hyper  in very reasonable rate and very safe to use in bedroom  brand  a new company i think ikon or similar  panasonic oil heater be also available at their showroom  the stuff availabale  chinees low quality  in carrifor be not durable  
do not use kerosene or oil heater in your home  carbon monoxide be the number one winter killer  also if you use any space heater keep all drape and linens a minimum of 3 foot away on all side  never plug a space heater into a power strip  only directly into the wll to prevent high current draw from melt insulation and start a fire  these thing be dangerous even with proper precaution so at least read the warning and heed them  
also keep flamers out of the bedroom else you may have a sore rear in the morning 
good info tyler the first thing that come to mind for me be to plug the heater directly into the wall because the extension cords plugs can not handle the power and will burn out or cause a fire   tyler which one be the kerosene oil heater   we have these electric heater which look like the european water steam heater but i dont know whats inside them  
i do not know what style be available  however the stand alone one that look like old radiator be seal steam heater and you can also buy the small electric heater in which you can physically see the coil and they blow air via a fan across the coil  personally you should just have a warm body to curl up with  if it be too cold for one get a second and snuggle up  skin on skin be the best way to stay warm and transfer body heat  a 3 dog night be darn cold but on that same even a one woman night may cause perspiration  
i buy a fan heater at carrefour and it s be work fine  cuts on and off when the temp reach the setting you put it on  geepas fan heater  
i just blow a circuit breaker in the house  it do burn  the receptacle male plug from the heater  real bad completely  there go my 250 qr  i get to go  to buy from the hardware house an identical plug  later guy  
thanks  tyler  any brand you can suggest  pwb78  how long have you be use that geepas heater  im hesitant to buy it cause we buy a juicer w  that brand at carrefour  and the minute we try it  it do n t work  
just buy a new replacement plug and repair the exist cord  next step be to make sure the outlet be instal properly and then verify the rating on the breaker  do n t trust the wiring in the house until you pull the wall plate and check the wire size and termination  not the best electrical work be be do in the new construction  always verify  who can take a guy in a pink shirt seriously  
and no one take me seriously  it make me sad  
visas and permits medical examination info  hi all  i finish my medical exam here in doha  i would like to know besides hiv and tb  be there any other disease check in the medical examination  im only interest in the disease that will make me fail the exam  and how many day or week will the result will be available  thanks 
sif you work in the admin job then u only need to check hiv and ptb result after 3 working day  if you work a a medical  paramedical or any food handler job  you also need to check hepab and hepac   
im an i t  guy so guess i dont have to worry about hepa  what about other std disease  do they check those  
but try to be clear from all these before come here  welcome to qatar  
is the medical exam result always take 3 work day  beacuse my colleague do the fingerprinting 2 week after his medical exam and he say the medical exam result take 2 week  and the only thing for him to know if he pass the medical exam be because he do the fingerprinting process  and be there anyway to know if you pass the medical exam  
once you be do w  ur medical exam you can check w  the medical commission at least after 3 working day  just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you ll get to know if it ready or not  for a medical employee it usually take about 2 wks to have the result do due to other test  e i  creatinine test  that have to be send to hmc for investigation  in your case  you be only require to undergo blood test  hiv   chest x ray  ptb   so i think it wont take long that much  dont you have mandoop representative for your company  he be suppose to follow up all these thing and you can always check w  him  good luck  
thanks apple for always reply on my post  another thing  after medical will i immediately go for fingerprinting or it will be for another week or so  
yes  you can do the fingerprint immediately  so  just relax everything will be ok   
everyone be check for hepatitis c  not just those in medical or food business  after the medical your sponsor be alert via sm about the result  pass fail  assuming all be good next be fingerprint and after that your residence permit can be process  
so if it s find positive do can one obtain iqama  
no  any positive in any of the 3 test and you re denied residency and send back whence you come

the cambridge school doha 
i hear so many bad thing about it though  everyone be tell to avoid that school  they be suggest doha english speaking school or doha college  
send her to me  the best   baby care home they take kid from 6 month to 3 year   
dmis  go to school one day and check out the facilities 
try the next generation http  www tngqatar com 
thanks  i dont think i want to send my son to indian school  this tngqatar  what cirriculum be it  anyone have experience with the american school  or doha college  doha english speaking school  
asd do not start until 4 year old  dess be have interview for place now  but it be very hard to get a place with a sibling or british passport  and even then  rather hard   dess be excellent  however  compass be worth a look  a it follow an international british curriculum  i have hear good thing also about doha college and park house for parent look for a british curriculum  
i would highly recommend starfish  this school be best suit for your child  they ve get a highly qualified teacher and the facility be great also    check it out    if your child be already on reception age  i will recommend  the sherborne qatar  education be very important for a developing child  goodluck    
i be ok with either british or ib curriculum  but would prefer ib since we be from america and be plan on go back  i be just really stress out  i want to give my son the best education and opportunities out there  i do n t know what to do  he be 2 year old and i need him to get involved and start learning  things be so hard here as far a proper education  environment  etc  
if you be plan to go back to america  then asd be your best option  because  as far a i know  it be the only school that follow a us curriculum  their website be very informative  asd be where most american child go to school  include embassy related child  they do not start until pre k  four year old   so look for a good preschool be probably your best option and then enrol your child in asd for the following  space be limit for pre k  and so my understanding be that apply on the first day possible be important  this be usually a day in the autumn  but the website can help  in term of good preschool  there be several  and where you live will make a difference  there be many thread on this side with parent discuss the merit of each  i have hear very good thing about appletree and starfish  joining doha moms be a good resource too  even if just until you settle  if you plan to life in a large compound  you ll find that people be friendly and mor

sorry dont know cost  and my bos be away  you d be best phone them  my bos have look around a bit and this one he find resonable and good location for where we be base  
i think you good look into the qatar guide marhaba you will surely get an idea of the nursery school locate in doha  
i have a question here  i know in good school there be a long waiting lists  what the situation with the nursery  is that hard to get a placement there for the child  or demand supply be balance   you become responsible forever for what you have tamed   antoine de saint exup ry 
yes  there be wait list for good nursery and the good one seem to finish before 3pm  correct me if i m wrong   as for food at nursery   have n t come across that one  in the uk they do  i d be dubious about feed my child anything that come out of some of the nursery here   
a decent nursery over here that keep your kid until 3pm  it be not like england over here  avoid in house food too  too many support staff  from third world country that do n t wash their hand  only go with british run one and then i would check out the number of cheap labor  staff they have  look at be this way  if you be pay a lot of money for a suppose decent nursery  you would expect the staff to be train  over here we do n t have that  most of them have degrees  from a mickey mouse university  they say they have degree in nursing  education and admin  most ca n t speak english  really do your research  it be crap over here with the number of third world people who say they have degree and then do n t even know what they be suppose to be talk about  they be desperate for job and will lie to get one  they do n t care at all that your kid s education may be hinder by them lie  just be careful  
true  look for the british ran nursery  you ca n t go far wrong  they close before 3 pm though

welcome to qatar maid service does anyone know what a fair price be for a maid 6 hour a day  three day a week  thanks  
it 30 qr per visit madam   bcoz i m also work like that  
would n t that be 30 riyal hour  a 6 hour visit be 180 riyal  
some charge per hour  some by day 
3 time visit be equivalent in 90qr  its just for the transport 
i appriciate your answer but i m confused  30r per hour sound high to me  30r per day ca n t be right either     
which area  how about transport for maid  
alkhor  would need to have their own transpertation  
30qr per hour seem to be the standard charge for private arrangement for house cleaning here in doha plus you might have to pay a transportation charge too depend where she he be come from  hopefully you will find someone local in al khor  most cleaner here be either philipino s  sri lankans or indonesians  i have a philli lady and she be very thorough  speaking english reasonably well also help  why would you want someone 6 hr a day 3 time a wk  unless you also want someone for child minding  my clean lady do top and bottom of our 3 bed villa in 3 hour and do a good job  she come twice a week mostly to get rid of the dust that continually seep in from all crack n crevice  lol we do outsource iron though and i do our washing  if you can find a good laundry service in al khor it should be quite cheap and satisfactory  ours pick up and deliver too  good luck in your search and hope this help  
i should add about transport for cleaner  not many have their own car and pay a driver to bring them and take them home  this be why they charge a fee add onto their cleaning charge  
thanks for your help  i too have someone that come in around 3 hour  twice a week  however  i find that be only enough time to do the floor  bathroom  and a little dusting  my house be a 4 bedroom  4 bathroom  i know we have overpay him for year but be alright with do so  however  with that be say how no idea how much one charge per hour  he ca n t come anymore then he do now  again thanks

just comment how exspensive the accomodation in doha at the moment  4 yr ago when we just arrive  beverly hill be 6500 qr  and we think that be exspensive  safwany  i guess u know how much beverly hills cost now  my son school be in dess  so i guess when i move i need to move somewhere around that area  at the moment i be commute in the traffic daily from muntaza traffic light to the school  got alot of girlfriend who look around for a house  everytime they call for the agent they will ask where your hubby work for  bachtel  maersk  halliburton or something like that  then they know how much your allowance would be  if your hubby work in small company  they dont bother to respond to your query  rant over  
hi novita77  i do n t know exactly how much it be the beverly hill but i think it wont be less than 13  000  some agent be bad than the greedy landlord  it be well not to tell them where their hubby work so they can get a response  or you can tell them to contact me if you want   by the way  i may have something very nice in this area but it be not cheap  what be your budget  ayman 555 2197 
moving to qatar moving companies in doha hi all  does anyone know any good moving company in doha  a company that will move all my stuff without damage anything  and possible pack it all up for me as well  the move be local  within doha  
you can contact mr  kabeer at 5335914  he shift my stuff last year and the service be excellent  nothing break but he be not with any company  he operate independantly  
when relocate to doha last year  our agent be gac  they do a fantastic job  we can warmly recommend them  
 hi there  may i know how much it cost  be it a lump sum job  or per kilogram  or what   regards                                  did ye then think that we have create you in jest  and that ye would not be bring back to us  for account     surah   al mo emnon   verse  115                   
for me it be a lumpsum job  first he will come and have a look at the thing require relocation and then he will tell you a lumpsum price  however  pack  ie empty all cupboads etc  have to be do by yourself prior to his come to your house for transport  he will do all the dismantling of furniture etc  hope this info help  
try a company call runway international  they be pretty effecient  the number be 443 1529 
but they be kind expensive 
does he dismantle and pack for you or do you have to do that yourself  
hi all  i use mr  kabeer for my recent move within doha  his price be very reasonable  a third of the price of the major move company  they pack everything up for me  i have to organise my own box which i do from qmart at the mall  and they put all my stuff into them for me  they be quite careful with my stuff and no serious damage be incur  but i have to supervise that they pack the fragile item carefully  and instruct them on what to put in each box  i strongly recommend him  but a with any move  supervise that the valuable and fragiles item be pack carefully or even good  by yourself  also  be on hand to manage the packing  
as i write earlier  i get my stuff move last year  he be very professional  cheap and take care of your stuff  
after read your comment  i think i d give mr kabeer a ring yesterday  he arrange to come over  and i wait for 5 hour for him  when i try to ring him to find out where he be  he do n t answer  i call four time  then today he ring and say he be outside my place  apart from the fact that i m work today and he s 24 hour late   hardly reliable  so just a well i m not take him on the upside  i try runway international  they turn up on time  take 10 minute assess everything and ask all the right question  they may be more expensive than kabeer  but at least they ll show up

 i mean  it a good package  accomodation  4000  5000 food  1000  1500 transportation  1500 2000 for rent a car  owning  lease a car be the cheap way  misc  1000 1500 rough idea

salary and allowances faculty salary at qatar university i get an offer to work a a faculty at qatar university  the offer include  free 3 bedrooms villa  fully furnish  free health care  include family member  2 months pay summer holiday  round trip holiday ticket 1 month salary gratuity in a year completion  interest free car loan  60  000  a monthly salary of qr 20  500  would you please advice if this be a good job offer  
oh definitely  
not really  good accommodation but salary be low  in faculty i woul expect at least 30k  
you get me confuse   
just accept the offer and comedown     welcome to qatar 
wow  not much for a professor  
seem reasonable  you should n t expect much more than that  
good offer  geez  
in uk for example  http  www jobs ac uk jobs jv552 lecturer senior lecturer  18  000 and thats before tax which in uk be a lot    also no accom  car loan etc  that seem a very good deal     
whats your job title  lecturer reader assistant professor professor  a native british friend of mine who hold a post doc with a good few year of experience in industry be offer 10k basic  which he decline  to me even 20k be a bit low for a lecturer  it a shame that academic be offer such low salaried here  
should be make more than 20  500 per month  but that salary be certainly enough to live well on and to save quite a bit on  assume you wo n t have a lot of other expense   benefits  no tax  free furnish housing  probably do n t include utility  check on this  free local medical  note that this be only for local govt  clinic and hamad hospital  not the good private clinic in town where folk speak english  and it will not cover you when you return to your home country of origin in the summer  be warn  it should also include free school for any kid you have  you do n t say if you have any   and again  tuition here vary widely  so you need to know their cap on the dollar riyal amount because i be sure they would never pay to send your kid to the american school or something that cost more than  say  qr 25  000 year  here s where some extra expense might figure into the mix  so  not bad  but that salary be rather low for a phd  
salary and allowances 30kqr attractive enough  hello everyone  i ve get an offer from qtel in middle technical management with all inclusive qr30k  anyone experience with qtel work environment  kindly share your comment  plz  what be average cost of living in doha  can i survive consider not to opt for a lavish lifestyle  be it worth leave saudi telecom sar 25k offer  appreciate your kind feedback  best regard 
it s look attractive offer to me   
never do  here cost of living be double than ksa 
you can get an apartment for around 6  000 riyals  2 bedroom  in a reasonably good area  a car can be hire for 1  800 to 2  000 riyals a month  or buy one a you wo n t have a problem to get finance for buy  and the rest be up to you  how much you spend on food  you can go to 5 star restaurant and pay 300 riyals for a meal or go to the shwarma shop and other more simple restaurant and pay less than 30 riyals  there be choice for every taste price possibilities  i would never consider saudi  i would n t want to live in jail   
this be an attractive package  depends really on how you be go to live here  villa living be between 10 14 000qr month for something nice  and apartment living be between 6500 8500qr month for a 2 3 bedroom  so what you will be save will depend on how you be live  good luck  
life in saudi be much cheap than here  but you d be sacrifice the quality of your life for money  your choice 
i think the subject be about qtel offer  either to accept or not  
seem like a good offer also be you single or do you have a family a that will depend if that wage be enough 
they have know to pay more depends on the grade they assign  title   they tend to give you  1  a basic 2  market adjustment 3  transport allowance 4  housing allowance 5  housing adjustment allowance and more pm me for more detail

qatar living lounge buying apartment at the pearl hi everybody  we be consider to buy an apartment at the pearl  so far  we have contact the land  1st qatar  sabban tower and era  anybody who have purchase an apartment  please share your experience with these company  any upside and downside  
i be think the same  prices be on high side if you compare from dubai  not sure if i will buy or not  
can anybody put price or a 1 or 2 bhk appartment  thanks 
i believe a 1 bedroom be approximately 1 4 million and a 2 bedroom be approximately 1 8 million 
can expatirates buy any property or be there any restriction  is it possible to live and pay mortgage amount instead of rent  
cpostier you talk in riyals rite not dollar  everybody be right and everybody be wrong  it depend where you stand 
i recently purchase a 3br from the land  the sale executive be helpful and even take me to the site to see the progress  what question do you have in particular  stay cool  
so what be the approximate handover date for the land  i ca n t remember  be they the one who do n t include any of the appliance  just out of curiosity  why do you choose the land over every one else  yes  my previous post be in qr 
some of the apartment you can buy at the pearl they will let you change a bit of the floorplan that be what we do with a 3 bedroom take away the maid quarter  most of the development be behind schedule  prices be high to begin with but have go even high  say a 3 bedroom for 1 4 million now it like 1 8 and up  foreigners that buy can get a lifelong visa which be helpful if they want to work past retirement age  
well actually  i purchase a 2br from udc back in 2005  i go back to them to buy the 3br but be tell that price be go for 13  000qr per sq  m  the land be price more competitively at 10  000qr sq  m  and have a good payment scheme  i be tell that handover for the land will be in the june  i be tell that udc will handover in may  stay cool  
it be true however taht they do not include the appliance  stay cool  
salary and allowances is 30000 qar good enough salary for a couple to move to qatar  moving to qatar soon  have receive an offer of qar 30k  be that good enough for a couple to be in qatar  we have no kid  
that s good offer  welcome to qatar     
i be receive less than that and i have move to qatar with wife and 3 kid and yet somehow we manage to survive  surely 30k qr will be more than good enough for you and your wife to live and enjoy life in doha  
i be receive less than that and i have move to qatar with my wife and 3 kid and yet somehow we manage to survive  surely 30k qr will be more than good enough for you and your wife to live and enjoy life in doha  
oh come on  be you stupid or what  that be good money and you know it  if you ca n t figure out if that be a good enough salary then you do n t deserve that amount  
it depend on your live standard and expectation for saving  in this connection it be important to know do all allowance  specialy accomodation allowance  be include or not in this amount  for example rent of a villa will be in the range of 12  000  20  000 qr etc  good luck 
do you think that you will earn that amount in your country     cmon   and how come a lot of expats are coming to work instead in their home country      dont be so silly   
it depend if it be exclude the accomodation or include because if you want to live in a villa you need something like 10000 qr monthly and if it it be include then you will end up with 20000 which be enough to live a meduam life for you and your family to be honst i think it be a good salary for an engineer or maybe senior person so go a head and good luck 
depend which one be your life style  is the accommodation pay by company  and the car  3000 for rent   do you like compound villa  12000  or apartment  7000   do you like club  500 per month   do you like drink alcohol  500 per month   do you like go to restaurant  700 per month   your wife like new clothes  1000 per month   qr 30 000 be not enough for western couple  
if it s not at least 3x what you be earn in your home country then i think that would not be enough just my two cent 
for a manager from uk  it be reasonable  not too good  you need qr6500  2 br appartment with out gym  swim pool   14000  4br compound villa with swim pool  gym etc  for accomodation 2300 for car  300 for petrol  2500 for food  if you cook  2000 for week end outing  1500 for child education  all togeter around qr15000 will go a minimum expense  if you be bless with free accommodation  this salary be very good

doha shopping when do qdc close for ramadan  hi do anybody know when qdc close for ramadan this year  thanks 
1st day of ramadan  guess 19 july be the last day of shopping and first day again on 26 august 
i think the good question be why do it close during ramadan  
double allowance   
my guess be it will close on the 18 july  
worst thing be  qdc have to close be it 18th or 19th july     
miss t  it triple   
ha ha  enjoy your close qdc sucker     p 
damn a whole dry month   yikes

thanks for the warning  i have the same problem  rizks offer my 200qr and free papadoms for a month   o  
just make sure they be not undercover cop  i ve hear of that happen in the past  
disgraceful  they should apply for a lience like everyone else and then they can buy as much a they want of the amber nectar  
they would qdc if the company give them a noc for liquor permit  
they must be the guy who want to buy a drink but cant get their hand on a permit to buy some of this drink a their company wont give them a permit 
well they can always brew their own  or trip on other substance   
be there any other way to get a liquor permit without the basic salary of 4000qrs    
just ask    
i know a few people who sell liquor away from qdc  high risk  
qatar living lounge what malt beverage do qdc carry  a friend be go to qdc on my behalf  i do n t have a licence yet   and i need to tell him what to buy  the catch be that the friend i be go with be a strict wine drinker and ca n t recall what s on offer beer wise  for you beer drinker  help a brother out  what be on the beer list at qdc  i want to stock up while i ve get the opportunity  thanks  
carlsberg  tuborg  corona extra  kilkenny  guinness  franziskaner  kingfisher premium  kingfisher strong  heineken  beck  vb  crown lager  tiger  singha     just to name a few  
wow  thanks azamat  big help  
hey  just fyi  it be illegal to ask your friend to buy alcohol for you  
at the end of the day the end justify the mean and after 20 beer who care what you be drink anyway 
never heard or saw a rule to say that buy a gift for a friend be illegal  selling alcohol on to other people after you have purchase be illegal though  sharing a beer with a buddy be just good manner    
if what i have understand  the alcohol be allow to travel from qdc to only the purchaser premise and shouldnt leave the say premise thereafter  sharing it with anybody at the say premise be not illegal but carry it to some other place or it be carry elsewhere when give a a gift seem be n t allow  i would love to be tell it be otherwise    
 yes  with a qdc license  purchase and then take directly home be the only thing allow  if you go to your friend s home when your thirsty  maybe that be ok   dunno i do n t think anyone can buy  legally  and take to someone else s home and   leave it there    seems like someone will think this be break the rule   
are there any beer that azamat miss  
red horse  san mig light  salitos  foster s  chimay  stella artois  budweiser 
qatarisun be partially right  it state there in permit rule   5 it be strictly forbidden to give alcohol to other s whether by sale or gift  but personally i like an ice cold corona   have a good one   
qatar living lounge when will qdc open back up eid 2012 hello qdc be close on thursday due to the eid holiday october 2012  does anyone know when it wil re open  thanks in advance 
i be not sure but it will open either monday or tuesday 
i find there number 44699412 and the recording say they will re open sunday 28 october 
yes  reopen on sunday 
how be we suppose to celebrate eid when the most important shop in qatar be close  they should extend the opening hour not close it  we also need more shop  one in west bay and al sadd would be good 
actually the word out be that they be in the process of open a lot more shop to cater to the heavy demand from card holder and those without the card too  there be talk of one of this shop come up right next to the karwa bus stand in the city 
plenty of people celebrate without a problem in spite of qdc be close  if alcohol be that important to you  then you should have stock up beforehand  you have plenty of notice  
lol i hope it never open up  
it would be even good if qdc deliver  that s the sort of service we need in doha 
you mean home delivery like kfc  wow you should get an award and a box of mc dowell free for make the suggestion of the month  well if they do it this way then business should be boom  boom  boom all the way to the brewery well do  keep those suggestion come 
it be the obvious solution to the disaster of where qdc be locate  plus they would not have to open other branch  just one big warehouse and an web page list what you can buy and a fleet of driver  wallah  happiness for customer and qatar airwyas make lot of money 
qatar living lounge gone off  wine from qdc we open a new box of wine last night which have recently be purchase from qdc to discover that it have go off  it s the same wine we alway buy so know what to expect on open a box  opened a second box and it be fine  has anyone have this experience before  do you return it to qdc and if so how do you get on  
 what do   go off   mean   
that will be why i feel so sick today     p 
are u reffering to stanley s goon wine in a box with a black tap at the bottom   
by go off i mean undrinkable  even by me     it s drosty hof red  
tfs will keep an eye on that brand the next time i buy  
i have this problem with stanley s boxed wine   then i switch to jacob s creek   
i just feel that a whole box  qr136  be too much not to bring back and complain about  so be wonder if anyone else have have a similar situation and bring stuff back to qdc  
take it back and demand a refund or replacement  you would if you be at home  why should it be any different in qatar  
maybe bad spirit in the wine  lol maybe the good spirit just die  lol 
or use a vinegar

vegas   man  u need to chill out a bit  i beileve that this be a one off exemption co of approaching ramadan and you be entitle to your 3 month quota  july  aug nd sept   in this month itself and maybe thats the reason the machine be show such a highrer limit it might come back to your original limit once you satr again in octobe  this be normal every year during ramadan  
this may be for 3 month  b coz of ramadan

qatar living lounge help  talk to me about eid  i know it s a way off  but i would love to hear how people in qatar celebrate the holiday  i imagine it s more fun here than in the u s  for example  because qatar be a muslim country  does anyone have special tradition to commemorate the end of ramadan  i would like to profile some responder in a magazine i write for  let me know asap  thanks   
i remember my eid childhood  it be great  we d first meet up at my grandfather s home  we d all talk and the child would plan 3ayuding  we d all go from house to house  sing a song and look cute and be give 1 riyal  after go door to door  we d go back home and play until it be time to eat the large feast  parents would usually chat  families get together  people visit and they have some tea and snack  we pray  i love eid   cost of living  visas  safety info  tips on moving  facts  pictures  videos  and more  
we all qatari first go for the eid prayer then from there we directly move on to our grandfather or father to greet them of eid and sit for a while and have some eatable and go for sleep in there house 
i can understand your frustration  go to a clinic  have them inject you with something that would give you a comma until ramadan be over  otherwise  can i come to italy with you   ticket  hotel on you  ruffino on me   img nid 27385 title desc link none align left width 180 height 125  
oh oryx  you be so right  ramadan should be a month of less  material thing  and more  spirituality   for a lot it be  our schedule do not change much  eg  we do not eat all night which negate the point of fast in my opinion   we break our fast at sunset with a small light meal  then we have dinner in the evening  we get up before dawn for a small breakfast  we try to be good muslims in this month  in the hope we can carry this on throughout the year  i do see qatar change from when i be a child during ramadan  this be something to do with u  of course  and also the influx of expat   love be the answer  
we tend to do a bit of bake prior to eid  usually the night before  or earlier if you re really organise  we gather the kid around and make some biscuit and traditional sweet  these be then ready to distribute during the eid prayer and also to the neighbour  they be also really handy when people come to visit you during eid  what i ve notice here in qatar be that friend and neighbour seem to visit each other a lot more on eid than back home  i guess it s because we do n t have family here  so our friend tend to become our new support structure  on the 2 eids that i ve so far spent in qatar our new  tradition seem to be go to city centre and get some good sale item  lol i guess that s our variation on spend the day at the park  too hot  or visit the grandparent  too far  or stay at home  too bore   
eid be one of the main celebrating funtion in qatar and be celebrate with full of enthusiasm u find the road glitering with the light and in the evening u will find a very fine fireworks on the corniche side  
 be the only escape relaxation for those poor worker where they can socialize  wear colorful cloth  take photo to send to their family  feel human  in many country there be many national religious social holiday for the people  but here it be only those 3 4 day  or even 2 3 day    be strong but not arrogant be modest but not weak   s h  
not at all  holidays will start from 25th ramazabn to 5th day of eid i e atleast 9 holiodays  moreover just look at ramazan timing  school  only 4 30 hr office  only5 hr 
 i be talk here about the poor worker of private sector in real life  not the cyber govenment  semi government emplyees the 2 eieds per year would be either 2 3 or 3 4 day   be strong but not arrogant be modest but not weak   s h  
look  these poor worker be enjoy more at their work rather then get holiodays and move around 2 3 day be far enough for their enjoy coz they prefer to do work and earn more and more overtime and salary

qatari culture is it in appropriate for western men to wear a thoub and shumagg  is it in appropriate for western men to wear a thoub and shumagg  they look very comfortable especially during the summer  i want to get one but i don t want to offend anyone or do anything inappropriate  
only in halloween  emancipate yourselves from mental slavery none but ourselves can free our minds  
i dont think it s a good idea just because it s too easy to get something wrong when you do n t know exactly how it s suppose to be wear   and especially not for halloween  that s just ignorant  that s a good way to really piss someone off  they should have a sense of humor about it  but it could be a sensitive issue  
no one here look at the colour of the skin when you wear the thobe  and it really comforable to wear in the summer than the suit  for some it a way of life to keep mocking at others and then claim that all be in light banter  
   it s too easy to get something wrong when you do n t know exactly how it s suppose to be wear   i ve see the thoub and shumagg worn in a 100 different way  i think it s up to personal style and taste  i could be wrong  could some from qatar confirm this for me   
i wear an abayya sometimes  the other day when i be wear it  i just didnt feel like be look at  without the face thing  several car be follow me  they be guy with beard inside  i dont know if they be flirt or not because afterwards someone tell me that foreign woman wear an abayya be usually prostitute   i like to think i can pass for an arab  now i m not sure whether i want to risk it or not  it be so ironic  
do n t do it  it be for some reason offend to local  evn though i agree with you  they do look comfortable in the summer i always tell the truth  even when i lie 
   foreign woman wear an abayya be usually prostitute    so if i wear a thoub and shumagg will i be consider a gigolo  hum   mike bigalow  qatari gigolo  i could get use to that  lol  
i think there be a lot of misconception gooing on around here  i dont think anyone over here get offend if someone wear an abaya or a thobe  has anyone ever be tell off because he be wear a thobe  
you can wear white cotton underwear  a white hat and a thobe  make sure that they be iron  clean  for female  i recommend abaya that be put on the head not on shoulder  you could cover your ear  neck   all hair i also recommend that you cover your face if you feel unsafe  
  but local be oblige to wear it  i be tell at work that they even get an allowance to wear the costume  not sure from the company or the state   they be not suppose to wear anything else while in qatar  it be sort display that you belong to a certain race when you re in a minority situation  and i m not go into the vip territory again  as for western woman wear it  as long a you re not walk   alone    it should be ok  at the least you should be walk with another woman  preferably wear the same  if you two get into a landcruiser at the end of your walk  that s even well   moudir

that s a feature  you be keep log in until you press logout  this be pretty normal for website  if you use a shared computer  always remember to logout    please read our community guidelines before post on qatar living  it will save u all a lot of pain

without government approval of your marriage  you wo n t get a family visa back into qatar  unfortunately  marrying you out of the country can cause major problem for your fiance  so i would suggest you wait until your marriage be approve  the only other option be that you relocate somewhere else  marry there  but your marriage will not be valid in qatar  and you will have no claim to any inheritences if god forbid  something should happen to him  does your fiance not have some wasta  that can obtain your release from your company  i be not say that will make thing any easy  since you still need to have the govt approval for marriage  but at least you can be in qatar  near him  
fil im sure she be just naiv  for sure he be married and his family will accept her   never believe me their pride be number 1  ufff i wish girl dont trust them so easily and dont beleieve them everything bhut what to do  
xena  maybe he not a true qatari only he be bear here like a lot of others that claim to be qataris  plus there be other issue will his family ever accept you the answer probably be no  
im sorry mr amyooo not all the same    they can get marry why not  im filipina marry to qatari for so many year i have approval my kid be qataries  if god will permit  no one can stop  and so many qataries be marry to filipina  sorry to tell you  
qatar living lounge what be the way to laugh loudly  i be relationship with an woman for more than two year  we be together for 14 day in these two year but use to be online most of the time  recently i come to know that she be already married and i break up with her  i would like to laugh loudly to get rid of this stress  so ql member share your idea which should blast a very loud laugh without spend money

c mon man find a friend to talk 2 it come handy a always specially during emo problems want to laugh to get rid of stress mean you re be still in the process of get rid of her of course that would not be easy  keep yourself busy and try on for some mental sport will help your problem  gud luck

i think there be a lot of private  international comp which be good than qp jj 
the best company in qatar be the international company such a shell  exxonmobil  occidental  maersk and some others  the problem with the local company be that they can fire you anytime whereas the international company tend to keep people a they have train them from scratch so lay them off be not an option  moreover in the q companies you will not be learn anything and just sit idle  i definitely agree with imz in this regard 
trust me  i know a lot of ppl from q  companies who do shitall work at office  coz the ve get nothin to do  i m sori to say but i cant work in that environment  keep slack your work or somethin  if u c the work at q companies  you be gon na laugh your ass off  although i nvr do get an offer from q company but even if i do get an offer  i ll make sure i join a q company if i feel like not work and that would b when i m 50  lol  shell  exxon mobil  oil co  obv be the best to work for but in case you dint get them you could also think abt co  like schlumberger  bakerhughes  weatherford  etc i e  oil service co  these be the co  you d b proud to work for  dont forget ppl from these co  be hire by qp s rasgas and all  and i personally believe b coz of these ppl only the qp and rasgas sort of company be alive  otherwise they no more than any local shit co  here

how about rasgas  is it good  i have apply for a it job there  but not sure if i should take it  2 reason for be skeptical   1  localisation  2  outsourcing  maybe they will hire me now on rasgas payroll  but late outsource their it to a 3rd party which will be a pain  just some anxious thought  appreciate all he help to correct the same

qatar living lounge drinking in qatar  i want to know what the law be about drink there  is there a licence that allow you to drink a certain amount etc   what about contractor for company over there  is there a certain limit to drink etc  any info that be real please let me know  thanks 
yes you can drink in hotel bar or get a liqour license and you have a ration per month depend on your salary 
licenses be for purchase alcohol from qatar distribution company  to get it you require salary certificate from your company with the follow detail  1  basic salary  min 4500   2  wether company provide accomodation else mention allowance detail  thats all it take religion doesnt matter    
so say that you get a license do that mean you can drink at any bar  what be the normal limit for a contractor  
a license to purchase alcohol mean you buy booze from qdc and drink in your house  you dont need a license to drink in a bar  
and for your information religion do matter  no muslims be give alcohol permit  
depends on how much the contractor can drink    
if a contractor get a license and decide to drink at a bar they can go to any bar  
smoke   paleezz dont rub that bull shit here  i be one and i have my license why bother  why dont you call qdc urself to find out  
i didnt know they suddenly change the rule for muslim to buy booze  
well i do n t know what qdc be  also i be ask because all i know be i be tell that you have to get a license to drink

qatar living lounge cost of alcohol guys  and gal    when i get my booze license  what will a decent bottle of wine cost me at the store  a corona beer  a carlsberg  assume they have these of course  just try to get a feel of the cost of live there before i move  any advice appreciate   
your life  in long term a per my limited knowledge                           we be no more liking truth  so not speak truth 
it cost liver   
it cost liver   
it be perfectly safe to drink alcohol in moderation  why do certain people assume if you drink alcohol you be an alcoholic who s go to contract cirossis of the liver  
a cheap wine  hardy s vr or stamp  banrock station  and such be about 35 qr  you can get some nicer wine for about 50 70 qr a case of 24 corona be about 140 qr  heineken about 130 qr  they have carlsberg  but i donh t know the price  i assume about the same        
my husband just go to the qdc yesterday but the bill seem to have vanish  anyway  the cost be reasonable  the beer usually come in case of 24 and there be a good selection  i have hear of people make request for specific thing when they ca n t find them on the shelf and they have bring these in  they limit the amount you can spend to 10  of your salary  
what       i can only drink 10  of my salary         how do they determine this  
it s reasonable  not ridiculously pricey  but not cheap either  
you have to present them with a letter from your employer  
10  per month  
qatar living lounge bars in doha     why there be not much bars or dance club in doha like dubai   people here enjoy in other way what

be stupid   
there ar n t many bar or dance club in doha like dubai   people here enjoy in other way

doha shopping price of a beer in doha hi  1  a you maybe aware there will be around 800  english football supporters in doha on 14th nov  how much be we look at for a price of a beer  2  do you know any pubs  bar where we can drink with the local cheap than in the rip off hotel  cheer 
local be not allow to go and drinkinside the bar  so you cant drink with the local in a bar  
best palces to drink be either the ramada or the sheraton  irish harp   price be 36qr per pint  nowhere cheap to drink unfortanately  one of the drawback of this crap hole of a country   
sorry  but a i know beer be not allowd to drink in qatar  
drink with the local  this be an islamic country  the local do n t drink  there be no longer any bar except the rugby club that be not attach to hotels as far a i know  you have to show your id card to get into lisenced premise here so not sure how it will work with a visitor visa  it be definitely illegal not only to import alcohol but also consume alcohol in any public place and also be drink in public  sorry if i sound unwelcoming  i really do n t mean to  just not sure if you be go to be disapointed that this be n t what you expect  
 locals dont drink            you must be joke go to the any   joint   bar late night  i hear local  change their dress to shirt  pant and drink  
ok yes  i be sure the qataris will be overjoy to sit about drinking with the english football fan  for goodness sake  the local do not go and sit in pub  which be what this person be ask  and drink beer then go and watch football  it be one of the many reason that i live here and not there  i answer the question  the whole point of the question forum  
just curious  why be it mandatory for these pom to drink beer to watch football  
cheapest place to get tank up be the qube but it ll cost you 80 note to get in  oh  and by the way  do n t forget to take along your passport a id  alternatively  befriend several member of the rugby club  buy them drink all night and you ll still save money    
its not gon na be like go to a match back home mate  no pub to go to before the match  drinking be only allow in your home  if you have a liqure licence and you will need id to get into any of the hotel bar  best you book into a wet hotel so you can have a couple before go    
it may cost u just  1 50 riyal  n if u buy in salwa industrial area  it will cost u 2 riyal   enjoy have fun

a muslim will not get liquor license in his name  they can get it for a company register in their name  
if a person want to drink he can drink it not a matter of religion  
muslims be human  
i be kind of very surprise to read few comments  liqur be haram in islam  and muslim sud not drink it for any cost  islam make rule for muslim if a muslim think he be human and human sud have freedom then get out of islam and try those religion where they allow freedom islam be modern religion with freedom but have it limit with boundries  no compromise over religion 
stupid idiot man who tell u that muslim can get license here for liquor in this county it illegal for muslim and dont come here just for bark if u dont have right information ok get lose now 
hi  ql it not a matter of religion but for those who want to drink alcohol u ca n t stop them ok  they will hide and pretend bcoz it not allow soooooooooo be open that s the answer     
socialising available beer type  i be think of come to doha soon to live  ok i understand about alcohol permit and how there be just one shop  must be very busy with a few hundred thousand expat    as someone who enjoy more flavorsome beer than standard lager i wonder what brand be available  i e  are there any english ale  belgian beer  other than stella   interesting german beer  or be it just bud  heineken etc   
well the place mostly so quiet so u can run around pick your beer   there be plenty of beer brand  corona vb kill kenny amstel light strongbow and so many others happy shopping  dont drive with alcohol smell in your mouth here big trouble  
they have a pretty good variety  here s a few  heineken  fosters  carlton  tuborg  san miguel  kingfisher  and old speckled hen  
do not go shop for alcohol the day before ramadan  the line be out the door  plan ahead    
i cacnt find any laurent perier any more when it a big season like christmas or new year eve and it bloody full of people 
they get budwieser to  the foster taste funny here and they give me a headache  
n i be gettin a beer belly olready  do anyone know where can i get bud light  and do it actually work  or i j need to cut down on beer  hehe 
tsardoz  talking about flavoursome beer  you can buy franziskaner wheat beer here  nowehere as good a schoffer hoffer but a good compromise consider you re in an almost dry nation  so if you re a sh fan like me  drink your fill before you come over  i remember that terrible desperation when dan murphy s stop stock this beer in melbourne  after a brief search i find it at vintage liquors  coles   you can get your share of euro lager a mention by previous poster  as a true blue aussie  i m sure you d understand if i say i can piss good than a bud and wo n t touch fosters with a stick  vb  guinness and kilkenny can be find here too  sadly no xxxx or carlton cold  if you re feel adventurous or want to slum it  try kingfisher strong  as an indian i d also recommend the regular kingfisher  american style macro lager   not similar to the one that can be purchase in oz  that s make in new zealand under license  
 my husband bring home some carlton a few week ago and i m almost positive it say   cold   on it  maybe they just get it in  it s not a beer i m used to so i do n t really pay much attention to it   
i guess the last time i saw it be in rydges  give it a shot  and talkin abt kingfisher i miss it a lot since i use to be in bangalore till some time back  in doha we usually get only kingfisher strong  havent see the premium anywhere  and strong be dang strong  i be knock out in two big bottles   ouch 
i m pretty deject so far  oh well i ll get over it  kingfisher strong  franziskaner  thanks pothole   and old speckled hen sound about the most interesting for my taste  any german or czech lager  edit  hmmm  review for kingfisher strong be n t wild  http  beeradvocate com beer profile 91 1896 i ll make up my own mind though

your salary must be above qr 4000 at least  get the company letter head declare your basic salary and submit to qdc  4699413  they will take 1000 qr a refundable amount  
all answer be correct  no need a permit to drink inside bar

nope  do n t drive after consume alcohol  
soniya  one should not even drive after consume alcohol

qatari culture ny time article on obesity in qatar an ny time article that give an insight into qatari lifestyle and it effect on general health  http  www nytimes com 2010 04 27 world middleeast 27qatar html  scp 5  sq qatar  st nyt health and wealth  they never go together    
funny  what i ve see in the us be real obesity amongst child  teenager  adult  and elder  yes  there be a problem of obesity in qatar  however  it s not that huge in term of number  
qatari femme  2 thing be wrong with what you say   1 of course it not a problem in term of number because us population be 300 time big than qatar and  a the article mention  this only be between the 250  000 qatari s  the percentage of the obese people be where the problem be around 40  of qatari men be obese and around 45  of qatari woman be obese  are these not outrageous number       2 you ca n t compare country like that  thats unfair  how about we work on a solution to this obesity problem around the world  
the percentage of obese people in qatar be really alarming  just look around outdoor eating joint and see for yourself  and this explain why the number of people suffer from obesity related disease be on the increase  also contribute by the culture of marry from the same family tree   
  qatarifemme    not that huge in term of number       be you joke   for a country not even the size of one of the state in my home country  india  you rank fifth  sixth respectively in term of obesity  diabetes in the world  so quite frankly  your sta  
now now  let s not hound qatari femme for her comment  statistics apart  obesity be a serious problem  be it the us  qatar  india or elsewhere  gone be the day when child would beg parent to let them go outdoors and play with friend  all that kid want to do these day be update facebook pic  play console game and order in fast food  the first step be self awareness  as gadarene correctly mention  accept that there be a problem be very important  no amount of research  pill  diet program and goading be go to help unless a person or family sits down and take serious note of his her their current health condition  simple solution can make a very big difference  1  cook healthy food at home do n t order in  2  use healthy cooking medium like canola and sunflower oil  3  reduce cut intake of artery clog food such a margarine  fatty cut of meat  deep fry food  fizzy drink  junk fast food  4  eat appropriate quantity at fixed interval  5  encourage and parti   
what be with new york times and qatar  who care about obesity in qatar  why would it be of the american s concern  lol walla this be too funny  
 rofl new york time be worried about qatars obesity problem  so ironic and so full of shit  typical nosey attitude    yes qatar have obesity issue and most of it come from   american fast food    yep americans be work on their obesity problem  they be make sure other country be eat their very own junk food  spreading their love a usual  hypocrites   
can someone help me put on some weight   
trust me american and the american industry be 2 different camp 
that the only place in the whole wide world where i have see so much chocolate and candy sell and eat be here in qatar  when i first walk down those chocolate aisle of carrefour and the other store in qatar during my first month here  i be astound at the amount of candy be sell and purchase  
qatar living lounge what be the right age to start drinking  any thought  how about my opinion  beer  15 year whisky  18 year gin  17 5 year vodka  10 year rum  18 year now do n t ask for logic just for fun  
   dgoodrebel will always be the rebellious good one    
 now do n t tell me it have something to do with religion lol     life be beautiful  indeed  
better not to drink   it do nasty thing to your body and your disposition  vodka  10years   you ll be dead by 20 year  especially  if it polish vodka  
  u r high man      kids  you tried your best and you failed miserably  the lesson is  never try     
   dgoodrebel will always be the rebellious good one    
whenever it be leagal to drink  or whenever you want to  
actually  i do n t need to respond to that i will leave it for you to decide  now can you please comment relevant to the op  life be beautiful  indeed  
 my own thought  drinking be for mature individual only  now  what age be consider matured enough  number you mention be not even legal in america    dgoodrebel will always be the rebellious good one    
my parent start give u beer when we be about 14  we have whiskey when be about the same age  but for a teenager it be n t really that nice  in summer it be gin and tonic  and wine too  we do n t have vodka in the house  but it s good for teen because you can mix it with juice and soft drink  in my opinion consume the infrequent alcoholic beverage be a much good option than give your kid soft drink  chip  chocolate  sweet snack  candy and burger on a daily basis  obesity and it related illness pose a much big threat to public health than alcohol abuse  
you be ask and then reply also  for me beer  wine  14 year all other drink can wait till  18 year  from then on you can have any bloody drink on this planet 
advice and help loose weight  dieting i do n t believe that i lose 5 kg in 10 days  by simply just count calorie and walk for 30 minute everyday  any one would like to share his her experience  
i m try to loose weight now  what would you say a normal day meal be for you  
i hate you   
count calorie  
zac  probably just water weight  
of course it be azilana  change in weight  calorie consume  calorie burn so if you eat more than you use  you gain weight  if you eat less than you use  you lose weight  magic  
bleu be right  the initial weight loss be water weight then the rest be a little tough to lose  it be really that simple  eat less and exercise more    it be so easy  it s hard  
i ve be so stress over my dog be sick that i ve lose 5 pound in 5 day  yep count calorie and exercise work  but  what you ladies have to remember be that men lose weight faster and easy than woman do  its the estrogen in our body that fight the weight loss  god make it so that we would always have that extra reserve in case there be a time of starvation or deprivation  so that we could maintain our body to have baby  if you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous  he will not bite you  that be the main difference between a dog and man  mark twain  
im try to lose weight and im on my 2nd week now  less carbo  no rice  exercise  green tea and a half cup of warm cinnamon and honey b4 breakfast and b4 sleeping 
scarlett  i just wish my body would understand im not plan to have kid anytime soon  s 
count calorie and 30 min  cardio excercise 5 time a week  
socialising drinking milk after eat prawn drinking milk after eat prawn be harmfull or just a myth  if harmfull whats the effect  
eh  who tell you that one  the garden fairy  
i hear abt drinking milk after eat fish be dangerous can drink milk after 2 hour after eat fish not before that  bt about prawns no danger at all 
ayurveda have guideline about dietary habit  like   in the evening avoid heavy food such a meat  fish  yoghurt  cheese  buttermilk and fromage frais   avoid eat between meal  instead drink hot water  or if necessary eat ripe sweet fruit   avoid reheat or stale food   most of one s food should be cook  a the body can more easily absorb cook food  raw food should be eat only a a side dish  e  g  salad    make use of culinary spice  they not only make the food tasty  but support the digestive process as well   include all 6 taste in each meal  sweet  sour  salty  pungent  bitter  and astringent  the taste also have their own influence on the subtle inner balance of the physiology   during meal you may sip liquid such a water  juice or lassi  do not drink a lot and avoid ice cold drink  they dampen down the digestive process   milk should not be drink with the main meal  it can be take alone or with a light meal of sweet taste food  e g  toast  cer   
i only know yoghurt and fish should not be eat together  
carbohydrate rich food be not combine with acidic food item  eg if you take bread and lemon juice together  it will cause the digestive system to erratically digest both the item  do n t eat grain  cereal or pulse item with acidic item like citrus fruit  grape  pineapple etc  protein rich food item go well with low carb food item like rice and vegetable  vegetables also go well with all type of starchy  carbohydrate rich food item  fruits should ideally be take a a separate meal  independent of other regular meal  milk and meat be bad combination  never take milk and meat in a single meal  separate intake of milk and meat by at least four hour  milk and meat be good for body in several way  when take together  it become toxic  many modern food style fly on the face of this ayurvedic food combination rule  milk be also to be take warm  cold milk can cause indigestion  taking milk too hot also be not desirable  ending the meal with sweet dessert be not allow in ayur   
i be also wait for the answer now   gosh be it harmful   
ice ask your grandma  she will give you the right list   
say what  
most of the people wo n t follow all these  me too so i be award with high cholesterol and uric acid

check out splash   at city center  they have plus size for men  i be sure they would have it for woman as well   
 p 
xena  what a coincidence   d 
haha  thanks  will check there  good to see few of you still awake after the excitement of world cup finale     
 try punto roma at villagio  and popka  upstairs at royal plaza and debenhams  all can be pricy but have good sale 3 or 4 time a year  there s another one i ca n t think of the name  but i hate their clothes because they look like   fat   people clothes  no style  old lady like stuff  this time of year be usually good for sale   
evans  villagio mall  they have size up to uk32  they have ongoing 50  off sale  further reduction when i visit yesterday  debenhams  city centre  also ongoing 50  off dorothy perkins  villagio mall  they have up to size uk22  also 50  off  further reduction  hope these help  goodluck    
there s a place in landmark too  ca n t quite remember the name though  but the stuff look nice  
they have lot of it there  
some shop also have big size up to 40 and up  punto roma for one  
doha shopping maternity clothes any advice on where to buy maternity clothes  so far  the few mall i ve look have either a terrible selection  i e  a selection of 3 different item  or the price be out of control  i m to the point of buy online and pay to ship  any idea   please  serious comment only  i m in no mood for sarcastic  silly  male humor this morning   
hi minoush  i think you probably try these shop already  ie  mothercare  mark and spencer  bhs  next  yup selection be awful  and price be ouch  have you try h  m  they do have many trouser  price range be 160 250qar  the other thing to do would be to invest in good pair of basic colour trouser and get your top stitch  
have n t try mothercare at cc  i hate go there but i may have to  m  s do not have a maternity section  i do n t get this  every local have at least 5 kid  plus every expat seem to be pregnant  where do they all shop for clothes  
i try h  m and their selection be ok  the only problem be the pant have this new fangled design where the waist be suppose to sit below your waist and it felt like my pant be about to fall down  just too hip and cool for me  i m old and i need mom jean     i will try bhs  i m use to target and discount store  the idea of pay  80   100 for a pair of pant that i will wear for 6 month be impossible  checked online  ship from motherhood maternity from the states be  70 for a ton of clothes  i think i will just do that   thanks lady   and thank you men for hold in your impossibly crude comment that you all love to make on every thread   
try babyshop and max in city center  thay have good collection 
hi minoush  you will have to go to mothercare at cc  because apparently all maternity wear from other mc shop be to shift to mc of cc  if not already there  you need to visit the mc inside debenhams  the local wear the abbaya  so a loose gown inside  the jalabiyas  more like the house maxi  be not visible to anybody  among asian clothes there be many loose top in style right now  with lycra tights  so again no problem there  getting t s be not an issue  as long a you be okay with it hug you tight all day  the trouser style  be the low bump style right now  and it doesnt really fall off h  m have the high waist trouser  not sure about baby shop for maternity clothes  else you may have to try the large clothes section  like evans  if you be look for comfy top  check giordano a well  they dont have maternity  but they usually have these loose comfy linen trouser that you can tie under the bump  
based on all our comment  a trip to city centre be on the card     you should find what you be look for in atleast one shop there  you can also check chico  
thanks all  yes a trip to cc will be in my near future  also  i think legging with long loose top  i know of a good tailor who can make some blouse for me  
if you want a bargain  try shopping at mr  price in hyatt plaze  prices range from 60 qar  100 qar  low price compare to the other brand shop  
make a rude  comment in here  i be hold myself since the start of the thread  many congrats  
i agree  pretty bad  even bad if you want to buy something for work  h m be fine if you be look for casual but that be it  bhs do not have a maternity section  i ask in the one in landmark  and mothercare be very expensive  perhaps order over the internet  
doha shopping have u ever notice        yesterday i go to villagio and notice that dresses for fat people be so bad and so shapless that if they wear they ll look more fat and it give a look of old fashioned texture and style  why like this    
people claim tey accept fat people  why they do n t  that s why 
you havent be to america or canada i guess  they be far more bad  i find here still acceptable  everybody be right everybody be wrong  it depend where you stand 
try splash at centre point  you can find something like  14 to 26 size clothes there nice color and design  
ulla popken do stylish size for fuller figure include career wear  not cheap but great quality and not cut with no style or shape 
if u look for the right size and the right style u will find soemthing that will not end up look shapeless  go to evans  they have lot of stuff  go to bhs  in landmark  very nice style and large size  go to splash  a fs they have a wide range of size and styles  h  m in villagio  also have variety  i dont find it discriminate at all  when u look in the right place you find what you want  i never have problems  wysiwyg 
formatted soul  i be look this kind of clothing for my personal use for sometime   ban spoon feeding not me 
clothes for fat people   lol i think it more diplomatice to say plus size lol 
with your size it difficult to find clothes for you  you need to order custom make huge size clothes lol we be talk about skinny people like us lol 
plus sized clothing be a problem everywhere i guess  but i guess us and canada be ok for asians coz their plus size be usual size in us america  no offence pls   i dream of a good tomorrow where chickens can cross the road without have their motif question  unknown 
i hear in blr you have exclusive shop for plus size  do they sell something good

qatar living lounge villagio store  city center new store does anyone know what store will be in the villagio  when will it open  what new store be be add to city center  
villagio be already open  and it be a carbon copy of city centre  do n t expect anything exciting  
there be no store that be new to doha  or at least not in city center  
judging by sign  90  be the same  after all how can anything be new to doha  if all store be own by same group of company  they just endlessly replicate themselves  
i think you be defenitely right  every mall shopping centre will have milano  starbuck  mothercare  bodyshop  next  carrefour  etc etc    
novita  at the same time try buy something useful  like universal remote control or 100  cotton bed linen  i end up buying first through amazon  and the second my wife will bring from home on the come week  and i spend almost a week of my time look for both in doha  
 well  will tell you that they have a river island  topshop  wallis  which r not in the other mall  seems to be very high street  the next store be well and they also have a small home accessory section  the best selling point of that mall be that it be alot quiter than the others so you can get a good service plus there be no where to   hang out   except starbucks so that limit those just hang out to stare at people  happy shopping  
anyone who have something to do anything with administration of these mall put up a website people  some huge mall go around and the only one i know that have one be royal plaza  and when  erm sorry if you put up one update it people with store that have discount etc simple marketing  and it would be good if the mall be open for long at least the entratainment place i e  bowling alley  xworld etc 
universal remote  lulu  ffc  the little cold store  megamart  etc  sheets  we find some at the home store at hyatt  i go back a few week ago and they dont have them anymore  overstock com be awesome for sheet  
i like river island and wallis  love topshop but the one at city center have a small selection  i do n t understand how it suppose to be the big mall here yet they dont have a website  stupid  
 well  it s not   home   but good than city centre and the wallis be not too bad  princess  
qatari culture qatari s attitude towards expat women  why  iam here in qatar for about 6  1 2 year  many people have say to me that they be happy about the qatari youngster attitiude towards the woman because these guy be not star at our wife  daughter in a bad sense like we experience in our country  do you think it be right  if yes no then why  
yes it be right  qataris be interested in arabic lady or any lady expose her body openly   i have see them follow only arabic ladies  they just stare at western ladies  
 depends what you consider   a bad sense    while a lot of religion s claim that lust be some sort of a sin  without it the human race would be in dire trouble a no one would procreate  people lust after people they perceive a fertile and viable for successful procreation  it s actually a biological form of flattery   
most qatari like qatari lady but some like and desire non qatari women  
as good a it may seem that qataris do n t look lustfully after expat woman  you ca n t judge the human mind  
 so who actually star in a   bad sense     
qatari s be more into glamour and dreamy stuff  which u will find alot in the arab female unlike the asian lady  just to update 90  of arab lady will not step out of their house without make up and well dress even if it for buy a bottle of water form a mall  they have to maintain there class   and not the least they want attention from other ppl  so it a mind plan which be insist the arab guy to check em out 
i mean  come onnnn  like who care just ignore  it s different from case to case  plus starnig  sadly  be not consider a rude in the arab world  fact  take it easy and act like you do n t notice  like they re invisible   img nid 7232 title dua desc amen    link none align left width 440 height 56  
i think you have to honest to yourself in every aspect of life  even if it concern your true feeling  hiding something be a sin  lets say you feel lustful and  
almost 6yrs here and have find that qatari men generally be very polite charming smell good respectful giggly 
i always have a feeling that i have qatari blood in me   
moving to qatar ezdan suites hi i be in the process of sign a contract for a 2 bdrm apartment at the ezdan tower in westbay  the sale pitch be great and the show apartment i visit seeme ok  from the early posting i sense there be problem there  can anyone help  should i go ahead or not  
 from experience  insist on see the actual apartment you will get  a some be considerable less pleasant than the show  apartment   only mad dog and englishman go out in the midday sun    
i ve be live in the ezdan for 2 week now  apart from the size and cost of the studio  no issue so far  
i go for the first time to ezdan today and what a complete and utter piece of trash it be  the finishing in tower 3 be atrocious  how could the builder let this happen  the building be relatively new and already broken tile  filthy cielings and wall  the wall tile be still filthy from the worthless masoners who instal them  typical old doha masonry  paint around the light switch  paint on the trim  careless finish throughout  plastic mold doors     how cheap can they be   seriously i would not pay 2000 qr a month for any these crap dwelling  filthy windows  cheap cheapo cheap cheap cheap a thousand time over  all this and i can believe people actually live in this skunkhole  trash top to bottom  i have see well in the old building near musheirib 
do n t beat about the bush  tell u what you really think  o  
that s true  finishing suck  a elsewhere in qatar  furniture be not brand new  but at least comfortable and clean  lighting be dull in the appartments  kitchen be too tiny  windows be small and dirty  but now they start to clean them  to cover all these negative point they provide the best gym and swim pool in doha  free of charge for tenant  free cabel and internet  free shuttle bus from your tower to city center  so you do n t have to spend hour try to find parking there  housekeeping 2 time per week  full maintenance service  small cafe in the towers  you can enjoy a fresh coffee in the morning  the sea food restaurant  small play area for kid with slide and swing  all this be very helpful for the family with kid  especially housekeep    pesonnel be friendly and professional  
my friend live there  it s very cheaply build and you have a hard time get wireless in the apartment  he do n t recommend it at all  
it depend on what your requirement be  i ve live there for a month now and can say it be rather cheap overall  but it s also less expensive than others in the area to be honest  and already have few plumbing problem in my flat  on the other hand it be very convenient if you work on this side of town a it will save you a lot of traffic headache  plus i agree with olivka  gym and swimming pool be very good sic dixit zarathustra  
1 and 2 be suppose to be rubbish  3 and 4 be nice  mr  q s blog  a qatari s view on qatar  
brin 
i ve be at ezdan since mid august  im in tower 4 however  i ve hear some crap about 1 and 2 but 4 be cool  the only pain i ve have be that they insist on do one of the 2 cleaning per week on a friday morning  i mean  really   most people be try to sleep   i would think it would make sense to do it during the week  i have a 1 bedroom  livingroom  kitchen  bedroom and 2 bath  on a 2 month contract  honestly  i think it overprice  and im only on the 6th floor   but other than that  it pretty decent  
visas and permits is there anyone here marry to a qatari  i be work b4 in qatar  i leave qatar last yr but be n t able to get noc from my company  my fiance be qatari but we re plan to get married outside qatar coz we do n t have the approval yet in qatar gov t  now  my problem be how be i goin to go back there with him  can he get me a family visa  thanks in advance  
dream 
why do he not move to your country  problem solve khallas  afterall you r marry him for love and not for come to qatar right  
me  no you cant unless you have approval you have to wait 1 year then he can sponsor you with his own visa  like company visa or kadama under his name so it easy for you to chance later if you get approval  
english only in the main forum  
even you get marry to any country to have to apply here  but make sure he be apply not only tell you or something you have to be wise my dear  he be marry  you will be he s second wife sorry to ask like this cuz this all count  and his family know about you  
uffff omg    hahahahah i dont know what to do to laugh or to cry   listen if u believe him that he will marry u i feel sorry for u  second thing why u leave the country and why he didnt help u to stay and solve ur problem about the noc  that mean he be not serious with u  today im not in a modd to fight so i deleted the rest of my comment  i will let her dream about marriage with a qatari ufff how can she believe him if he didnt even help her to stay in the country  a allah      
without government approval of your marriage  you wo n t get a family visa back into qatar  unfortunately  marrying you out of the country can cause major problem for your fiance  so i would suggest you wait until your marriage be approve  the only other option be that you relocate somewhere else  marry there  but your marriage will not be valid in qatar  and you will have no claim to any inheritences if god forbid  something should happen to him  does your fiance not have some wasta  that can obtain your release from your company  i be not say that will make thing any easy  since you still need to have the govt approval for marriage  but at least you can be in qatar  near him  
fil im sure she be just naiv  for sure he be married and his family will accept her   never believe me their pride be number 1  ufff i wish girl dont trust them so easily and dont beleieve them everything bhut what to do  
xena  maybe he not a true qatari only he be bear here like a lot of others that claim to be qataris  plus there be other issue will his family ever accept you the answer probably be no  
im sorry mr amyooo not all the same    they can get marry why not  im filipina marry to qatari for so many year i have approval my kid be qataries  if god will permit  no one can stop  and so many qataries be marry to filipina  sorry to tell you

just a short piece of information   i actually write to ikea this year ask about the possibility of open the store here and in fact do receive a reply from them that they already find a partner here and be in fact go to open a store  the do not mention a specific time  regards 
bearbull if singways furniture be design by the same designer a their website  i d prefer to keep away from it

qatar living lounge why do they agree  i would love to hear from you  why after so many year palestine have be admit a an observe un member  why now  is there a motive dodgy behind this  does palestine include gaza or it be just the west bank  i would love to hear it from you ordinary guy  not from the news  m e  experts  political pundit  etc  
it be really complicated palestine be probably the most prominent indicator of how unjust the world be be lead by politics and power  to your point  i would say it be due to the evolution of the political scene and the behaviour of the zionist regime which push it into isolation to the point where they could not get adequate vote among un member state  additionally  west be a bit tired of support the zionist s state and clean up it miss so they want to have some stability the west be a key player in create the zionist state but they do not have the same intention zionist s had my think anyway interesting topic   
symbolic move that add further legitimacy to their claim 
why nearly all country agree be quite simple  most believe in a homeland for the palestinian people but not all can agree on what that should actually be  so make palestine an observe state be a statement of intent without back a full independence  israel while continue to build settlement in the west bank be undermine the whole process and it seem obvious they want to swallow all palestinian terrority  shame on them  
it be a sybolic move calculate to send a message to both party to come to the table and try and move thing forward  
two state on the 1967 border be fair to both party and most nation seem to agree  however israel do n t   
yes  palastine include gaza  actually it include all territory and border that be declare in 1967  which be actually an injust resolution  a the zionists have no right in any inch in palestine  
and rationality  yes it should have be do much earlier  however what have happen have happen  and it s best to look at it from a good now than later  and good late than never angle  i also believe that by make such a motion the un have gain some much need credibility as well  again not just with the people of palestine  but with people around the world in general  now how far would this change work in bring about peace among the warring nation be leave to be see  
i think the world be become rather weary of this  apparently  irresolvable problem  this late move be mostly symbolic  but very important and the environment of the region have change  post arab spring  the global community want a peaceful resolution and this should be two states  accord to the 1967 agreement  lets be clear  israel be not full of zionists  but they still seem to hold the power  and the palestinians need to address the problem of hamas for this to move forward  i be optimistic about the move   
 fathimah    what have happen have happen   would you say so when someone take your home  kill half your family  and throw the rest to live in the garden of your home  then start building room after room in the garden until you be cornerd in a few inch of space  it be not   happen    it be still happen day after day  quixote    palestinians need to address the problem of hamas   hamas be not a problem at all  it be a logical response to a terrorist regime that only understand the language of force  the real problem be those who sign peace treaty with such a terrorist regime   
hajji  what about the original arab muslim invader who conquer the land now know a israel palestine  because it be a long time ago we can forget the land be originally steal  if israel exist for a 100 year can we forget the arabs now a they lose the war  
qatar living lounge  guys do u agree with this      a woman s great weapon be her tear   well base on experienced it effective for me because everytime me  my husband get a small misunderstanding or fight  even if his too angry with me  once i cry he will be the one to say   sorry      i will not do it again  pls dont cry     even if it my fault   lol  
 i dont agree          you ladies always cry        i dont speak till she dont stop to cry     lol   drink beer save water    
u have a stone heart sent  lol even if love be full of thorn  embrace it  for in between those thorn there be a rose that s worth all the pain 
uk men be far too cynical to fall for that one  we woman get far more respect for stand our corner and not turn on the waterworks   have you no respect for yourself    keep smiling    you never know who be look 
i do n t even care if my wife quarrel on silly matter    i know  that she will come to me with a smile face after sometime  
my great weapon be my thought  nobody can beat that  everybody be right everybody be wrong it depend where you stand  
for some cry be not abt weakness or want the other person to say sorry or give in to the situation but instead for me when i do cry shed my tear be because i be so angry upset that i want to say thing that i be sure be gon na hurt the other person  say out of anger  but i be try so hard to control it a once it come out there be no way of take it back so to speak  so i be control it so hard that instead tear come flow down  most ppl in an angry state will say thing  hurtful thing  in the moment of anger and when all have subside realize that and it too late a it be already say and do with and hence hurt the other person    my mom once tell me the tooth paste story  only take the amt that you need if you be to squeeze too much of out the tube ya cant put it back in same go for thing say when in the heat of the moment  do more hurt than good  life s too short so make the most of it  you only live but once    
onsoling the unconsoliable be difficult at the best of time and word may only make the situation worse  wait till the storm pass 
tear be my outlet for an impending eruption boil inside  you cant take back whatever you have spit  so well shed tear than spit a mouthful of word bring by hurt or anger that you can never take back when you calm down if you believe  you will receive what you ask for in prayer 
if im right i ll fight for it  if im wrong i still think im right and keep quiet  
well say that be poetic  i be hurt  i do n t want to hurt somebody   so it come out in tear

advice and help which bank to use in qatar  hi does anyone have recommendation for which bank to use in qatar  the account will be use to get my salary pay into and transfer fund overseas  thanks 
i use to use cbq when i first get here  but i be n t happy with the service and product  now i use qnb and it fairly ok  but when it come to send money back home  cbq still offer good exchange rate  
doha bank ltd be mostly prefer by the salary class  
no worry bank  qnb  be with the royals                   
cbq be the good option 
most of the bank here provide good service to the salaried class and i hardly see much difference among them  you should select a bank where your company have a bank account a it will allow your salary get credit to your account very quickly each month  
agree with acchabaccha  go with the same bank a your company  unless you plan to take out a loan in the near future  then go with the bank that you re most likely to get the best loan offer from  
cbq  
thanks for the feedback guy  will find out which bank my company bank with and go with that 
good luck  caramel  super input by acchabaccha  acchabaccha mean lovely baby   
lol  thanks

advice and help car battery life does anyone know what be a typical life of a car battery  new car toyota model sedan  in doha give the hot weather  how often do you need a change  and what be a good place for battery purchase for toyota  
aaa have good suggestion if you be member battery life of sedan can be between 2 4 year 
2 3 year normally  
 18 month for   zero maintenance   battery  beyond that  you be lucky  but advisable to replace every 2 year if you prefer   
nbc  german brand  12 15 month guarantee 
if be it original toyota battery  japan made  life will be 2 3 year  for other brand  like ac delco  it will be 12  15 month  if your car still cover under warranty  then you can replace it for free  for the first time  for the second time only you have to pay 25  of it s cost  for the third time 50      that s only if your vehicle under warranty 
my car battery always die on me  in about 12 month  ac delco  and i always replace it at woqud  
or maybe that s the battery life indeed  
zero maintenance    
you re lucky if your ac delco battery  maintenance free  last one and a half year  
ac delco zero maintenance battery life would be at least 12 month hence they will replace it for free

family life in qatar marriage between a christian men and muslim girl  hi  i m a catholic and indian  i m in love with a singaporean muslim girl we both want to get marry  what be the legal procedure in qatar  she s ready to convert   any help will be appreciate   thank you 
no  no  no  muslim woman can not marry christian men  converting be also illegal  please be careful what you ask for on this forum  
absolutely wrong decision  you should first convert to muslim and then get marry  thats a legal and humanitarian way to lead a successfull and prosperous life in this world and the hereafter  if you want to convert to islam  which be a easy thing in the world   you can call me 66568786 or you can go to fanar  we be ready to help you  remember  peace lie in truth and surely islam be religion of peace and truth  
you can marry whoever you want  marriage be a legal and not a religious contract  
brother go ahead   love conquers all since god be love  but worry not  because it be not a necessity or requirement or any legal issue if you have different religion  if you be both adult  simply go to both embassy  and fill up the necessary form to go ahead with the process  and presto   you be both marry  later on  you can both decide which religion to follow  religion should never be a hindrance to love  it should bind u all  
i think christians be dominate in a muslim country  dear all  respect the nation where you be  
no  a muslim woman can not marry a non muslim guy  it not permissable in islam  but a muslim man can marry a christian woman whoever say it just a contract get nothing to do with religion  well bro it not a job offer ur accepting  it get to do with you and your accountability towards god 
before god there s no christian  muslim  hindu or jews etc  god love mankind whichever religion he hail from  
guy  he be ask the legal procedure here in qatar and the lady be ready to convert  dont make it complicate for them  it their decision  
just answer to what he be ask  
have u ever read the entire bible completely urself  please make sure u do that  before u try to convert any1 else to ur faith http  www freethoughtdebater com tenbiblecontradictions htm i mean no offence   just talk sense   u should read the quran a wel  and then compare and then decide who shall convert  if u convert to islam it easy for you to marry here as well

winnie park house have currently close it wait list for all year  i have two child at phes and so far have be please  one be in year 10 and hat the uniform  the school the teacher   i think he be settle in nicely  we have to wait until last week  end of sept  to get a place for my daughter in reception year  but the facility in the primary section be good  the class room be bright airey clean and invite  they have canopy area for the child to play outside  the school be small  about 600 include secondary   but they be currently build further extension for sixth form  they move into these premise over a year ago  all the teacher i have meet be enthusiastic and bubbly  the head teacher mrs brennan be very approachable and ameniable  they have a very pragmatic approach to education and have adopt the british healthy school policy  there be no canteen so it invent a many way a possible to make a sandwiche look interest for the next 10 year   
i be just this morning talk to a colleague who have two kid at park house a i be consider send my own daughter there  the feedback be very positive  good facility  they have now get their new place and be no longer use the russian embassy building   apparently the teacher be very kind but also exert a strong sense of discipline and manner  cell phone be not allow   they have recently start offer the international baccalaureate  everything i have hear about park house have be very positive  
thanks very much you have really put my mind at ease  i currently work for education here in the uk  it appear your approach to qatar be much the same a mine  give up the housework etc  and a for get trim again i be also go to enrol in some slow toning class  did you find it easy to make friend in doha  my husband have be there a week and could not even get to the beach on friday a it be member only  any suggestion for a place he can relax on his day off  he be wait for u to get there to join club etc  appreciate your help  
my husband come over by himself and he find the first week awful  he nearly come home several time  if your husband like a drink he could try garveys or the rugby club  alot of british use these  i believe you have to join a a member or come with someone a a guest  tell him to buy a copy of the marhaba in carrefours supermarket in city centre  that list all event happen in q and where to go  it be update every season  it be also available at jarirs bookstore  what co  do your husband work for  
i have email you directly a i be sure there be more knowledge you can share with me  do you live in a villa or apartment  our company have provide u with a new 3 bed apartment and i do not know what it will be like with a 7yr old  he be use to play out on his bike etc  i suppose a i will not be work i will have to keep him occupied  any good place for child to play met etc  we already have a copy of marhaba which have be useful  i think ramadan be the big problem at the moment  my husband have a company vehicle but i think i will have to get a car to do the school run etc  do you think i could hire one initially  or lease  who do your husband work for  my husband be work very long hour at the moment a they be so busy  keep him out of mischief i suppose  
our boy have also be regsitered at park house and we be move out from nz shortly  glad to hear all the positive feedback  a similar concern for our kid  
when be you move out  i will arrive early november  it would be good if we could meet up and let the child have a bit of fun together  i be concern for my little boy make friend quickly enough  samuel be start in y3 which year group will your boy be in  
i will be move out in mid november  and rest of family in december  ready for start in january term  making friend at their age should n t be too difficult  but agree it be a good idea to meet up and get them all together  
hi guy i couldt help myself but this topic have catch my attention  reason be be that we have an appointment with phes school this week to enrol my two son  im guess one will be year 6 and the other year 8  from what ive heard about the school it have a really good reputaion and just be new to doha now 3 week werve be tell that there be now space available  we do try doha but no luck there not until next year  so it will be interesting to see what happen  didnt realise get your kid into a school in qatar would be more difficult than get a job anywhwere in the country  
politics un move to protect gay  transgender in a late move  the united nations continue it march to further add homosexuality and transgender to it list of human right  is the un go too far  and what do this mean for country that condemn these thing a unacceptable to their culture  will the un of the future start put such nation on it pariah list  http  www chicagonow com trans girl cross 2012 11 united nations protect transgender  
i wish the un would show the same concern for all the child be murder in gaza  
mn  but a for now un s main concern and priority be to protect gayz  transgenders    
 france be allow   mosque for gay    so it s only a matter of time before it use it security council seat to push for this elsewhere  it s a brave new world  http  www albawaba com editorchoice france mosque gay 452009  
good on the un  nobody deserve to be persecute  
would openly list country where homosexuality be outlaw to be a vagabond nation  the matter of homosexuality be by far a much dispute affair among people of various religion  creed and race  that to simply state it s right and all those who condemn it for any reason be wrong  will not be as simple  that say if they wish to protect those who be gay and transgenders from oppression and mistreatment then i suppose they have all the liberty to do so  however yes they should also then open their eye to all the oppression commit around the world at large  and work towards stamp them out  and not just pick and choose to their convenience which have clearly be the case with un in the recent time  which have cause people around the globe to hold them in contempt for  and not take them seriously  
yes  the un for push for equality and freedom  should it put non compliant nation on a pariah list  no  
 does the un have a pariah list that they add country s who commit human right violation to  or will they just add   persecution of homosexual and transgenders   to their report on various country   
marco but what about the gay and transgenered arab in gaza  who will speak for them  
of course they must have the same right a all other people  after all  they be human and they be people  what difference do their sexuality make  they be still human  
i agree fatimah  but if the un say homosexuality be a human right  then they ll list country that persecute gay right along those that deny press freedom and get involve with human trafficking  etc  qdclover  there be no gay in gaza  
qatari culture can qatari girls allow marry indian     why arab girls not get marry indian man 
if the indian man be hindu  no  it s not allow  mandi 
so qatari female qler answer you that why they dont marry you  
give u some really knockout reason why we should  we re very picky so you ll have to be very persuasive                     
im go to be honest and blunt  i think it because most qatari woman dont find indian men very attractive  im just tell you what i think  im a qatari man and to be honest i dont care where your from it depend if i like you enough  
lol whitefeather  do n t go upset him now                      
                   
i mean no harm  p just type my thought  
 qatari lady  be never be allow to marry any foriegner even to any arab  so why wonder  qatari ladies be bear to marry gulf men only  but i know one  the father of the lady be half indian  and the father  arrange a marriage to her for an indian groom but i be not sure if the indian be allow by the government to stay here or even live here  the lady be qatari  her grandmother be an indian  but many qatari men be marry to an indian lady  i know alot    there s nothing we can do to change the past  if it teach you a lesson profit from it then  forget it     
if that the case  i wonder why the indian movie cinema hall be fill with qatari women  even men  if there be no liking for indian men or shall i say indian actors why be that most of the qatari women see first day first show of indian movies  the curiosity kill me  
be a god fear down to earth person  not be proud just wana share that i have be close to a few  its just that i be not a qatari or a muslim which they only find out after i tell them  or else i would have be marry to one by now  1 thing to appreciate qatari woman know how to respect their men  all other woman too know it  but see a lot in women here compare to their guy

family life in qatar aspire park new rule aspire park have introduce new rule   people who can not enter in aspire park   1  peoples who be wear shalwar qameez  pakistani dress  even if you be with family  2  peoples who be wear sudani traditional dress  sundani thope  3  people who be wear saariiii  indian ladies dress  and other nationality dress     even if you are with family or if your age is more then 80 years     what you say     
i say do n t do these thing if you want to go to the park  
what s leave  mandi 
thats what we call racism  
well feel bad about it     lets follow the rule    and not go to aspire park  what else we can do      
simply go to other park  to avoid disappointment  
that s unbelievable 
not surprise at all  a backlash in progress  chances be they ment no lebanese semi bedroom dress a well  but the punishment must go global  let s see who challenge the rule this time  and we end with harsh one  
do n t go aspire park  they just want expat to only work and eat leisure no included  
very good move by the management of aspire  
racism at it best

qatar living lounge  is there any clique  caucus in ql i be wonder  be there any clique  caucus wroking inside the ql  when pass remark about a post  my last post   is poetry bore   do not invite some of the   famous name   in ql  who use to comment anything under the sun     was it a post  which do not invite attention  or they ignore it in a chauvinist way   surprising  
those who be intersted in poetry will comment on that   its not mandatory to comment on boring thread  
mandatory to comment on boring threads  loooooooool  that s a start to the day  and well birdie poetry i guess be rather more to do a an exclusive subject to comment on  some like smoke would surely want to comment a he do a lot of poetry  below the belt though   p  but yea joke apart  guess it a high price subject so you didnt find much  
yes there s a clique  but no it do n t go as far a communicate outside of ql to make a group decision not to comment on a particular thread  threads with poem in rarely gain much response  so the answer be that it be a post which do not invite much attention  plus you post it late in the evening  which be a quiet time on ql  
 wth  poetry below the belt  what be that suppose to mean kind sir  i m so innocent and cute i have no clue  p anyways this   famous name   be not on ql to a lot to see your poetry post birdie but now that u mention it let me go take a looksy  d good fortune always come knock at your door  when you be sh tting in the toilet         smoke      
and my skill be zero in this art  you can keep nourish your thread by add few verse 
the birdie  poetry be not my cup of tea  if you post a thread about classical music  recital  i ll join in   dont be so too sensitive  
the birdie  it might be worth join the ql poets and writers group where you may find a bit more sympathy for your post  http  www qatarliving com group poets and writers in doha 
 read mode 
not even her own poetry  to be appreciate  lol some old fw  
probably because it be too boring to comment on  anyway what difference would it make if the so call famous  name on ql do post  how bizarre  whats a caucus  
qatar living lounge ql shutdown qlers  how would you feel if suddenly a message will flash on screen advise u that qatar living will be shut down in a matter of day  
i hope it wo n t happen  qling be a my habbit here     
i will start breathin then     
wont you miss ql    
half of me would be glad for spare time  half of me will be sad ill misz my ql friend

orelse do u wish it shud be shut  i smell sth fishy here  p something be good than nothing but nothing be good than nonesense  p

i want to be clear i have no wish for ql to shutdown  i will terribly miss it  but due to all the noise  fighting go on  it might end up to that  but i hope not   
qatar living lounge the new ql  copy  paste newsarticles it seem that most post these day be copy  paste job of upset  sad  negative news from newspaper  is this all we can come up with  where be happy and cheerful news and post  i miss those day  
all but lovely memory of ql   nowadays  i take a peep just to see what s post  and log out  i bid everyone good night  the sandman have come   
ca n t blame you azi  good night     sk  you be really think it will change  hmmm  it have to change start with yourself  it s like crybaby scream harrassment for poster who do n t agree with them  turn every comment into personal attack  racist bashing  attacking this and that nationality  why     
i agree  
but lately people just post it without any attempt to open a discussion  i have n t be around qatarliving that long  although do read it when i live in doha the first time  but from the short time i have be here i see that any interesting discussion be shut down due to whingers  crybaby and over zealous moderator  
do n t know about happy  cheerful but my stupid post will be back from tomorrow  sleepy tonight  hmmmm now let me think what to make fun of in those   
ca n t stand up to scrutiny and criticism be the bad in my opinion  i do n t know about you  but the god i worship be not such a ninny that he require protection from people who do n t believe in him express their opinion  
my motto be  leave the thread you do n t like  and do n t go cry to moderator about what others be discuss  
looks like this thread stir up the hornet nest wk come back with his stupid post    btw they would anyday be good than this copy paste stuff   
yay http  www qatarliving com node 1395231 
ql be like an elephant  everyone want to ride on it  but no one want to own it  and in touch with ql for almost 18 month  i just wonder  why my late grand father be admire from white company  i wish if he could see them on ql  
qatar living lounge to all auto aficianados on ql     can we have a group for autos cars    i m no expert so i dont think i should start the group   
for what rally   img nid 13339 title desc link none align left width 180 height 180  
not juz rallies races  automobile in general  car  bike  review  opinion  technical stuff etc  
decal  dressup  or what   me im a pro bike   
good idea  any volunteer  
someone teach me where to look if the car stop in the middle of the road  if the smoke be come out of the bonnet  what be i suppose to do  happy heart drive safe  someone be wait for you at home 
smoke come out from the bonnet probably your car over heating  you will need to put some water in radiator when the engine cool down  
what color be the smoke  han19  is it white or greyish blackish  has anyone work on it recently  you re suppose to park the car immediately  
what about car  decal  dressup  or what   me im a pro bike   walterdane anythin n evrythin relatin to all dat have 2 3 4 more wheel n move   u cant liv in this part without a ride  and we dont hav a volunteer in ql to start an auto group   c mon guy   wait  
i agree with e46  park the car immediately  there can be several cause  if overheat  you will have a more whitish smoke mixed with steam  do not just put water in the reservoir  you will need to use anti freeze  but you will also need to have your thermostat check out  if it greyish blackish smoke  you re burn oil and you most likely have a broken head gasket or valve  both of these condition be indicative of the bad case scenario  also  do n t forget to check your tire pressure every time you refuel  
in case of black smoke  park your car  get out of the car n away frm it  and if it steamy kinda smoke  do not do a novita sez  cuz if u open the radiator cap while it hot  u ll get a geyser kinda splash of hot water in your face n get burnt

haha why not  it might be fun  life be too short to be take seriously  
 ql will lose it s basic purpose i guess  in about ql they mention   participation be at the heart of our web site  we believe that collectively our member have more knowledge about life in qatar than any one person or guidebook  we want to provide a platform for them to share their knowledge and experience and help newcomer adapt easily to life in qatar    nobody share knowledge or experience or try to help others in a chat room  it will just become a place for guy try to pick up girl  there will not be any participation from all the member on any issue  people will be too busy chat in private  that s what i personally think anyway    live with passion  die with style    
 oh i be very good with research     live with passion  die with style    
don t love me be my friend 
no need coz we can chat by little bit hijack                                                               
 sounds good    i be actually think about that idea yesterday and i be wonder how come they do n t come up with it yet    i d love to change the world  but i ca n t find a big enough diaper    
 they do long back  there be a chat room on ql  get discontinue    live with passion  die with style

qatar living lounge why ql  now that we know of the grow popularity of this site  thanks to all it addict    but what exactly do one look for  friendship  dating  oop s qatari be watch  job s  pass time  i think we could use this thread to voice our opinion  
i think it s a toss up between a way to pass the time  and friend   d 
c mon gypsy im sure you can say more then that  i see that you eat  sleep  breathe ql     wishing you a seductive  wonderful day lick by luv  penetrate by heavenly grace  may all your misfortune be ejaculate  
hmmm  wonder where be han  she too share the same passion like yr     wishing you a seductive  wonderful day lick by luv  penetrate by heavenly grace  may all your misfortune be ejaculate  
i honestly do not know what it be  
sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they be mean to be there to serve some sort of purpose  teach you a lesson or help figure out who you be or who you want to become  you never know who these people may be but you lock eye with them  you know that very moment that they will affect your life in some profound way  and sometimes thing happen to you at the time that may seem horrible  painful and unfair  but in reflection you realize that without overcome those obstacle you would never realize your potential  strength  will power or heart  everything happen for a reason  nothing happen by chance or by mean of luck  illness  love  lose moment of true greatness and sheer stupidity all occur to test limit of your soul  without these small test  life would be like a smoothly pave  straight  flat road to nowhere safe and comfortable but dull and utterly pointless  the people you meet affect your life  the success and downfall that you experience   
is that the reason why we re on ql  quite an explanation for it  did you just write that  or be it a good cut and paste job  also forget to give credit to the real author                       buick s new car be call 71  it carry two in the front and 69 in the back                      www e4u name qa 
rayz  tell me why do you come on ql  its irrelevant if this be write by me or a cut and paste job  more important be gettin the message across and think over it  for now let stick to the topic my friend  btw yr dear friend cutesrk seem to be on a temporary ban  and i see that you be follow on his footsteps so watch out   wishing you a seductive  wonderful day lick by luv  penetrate by heavenly grace  may all your misfortune be ejaculate  
                     buick s new car be call 71  it carry two in the front and 69 in the back                      www e4u name qa 
be that a post  or do i see you sit on a lamp post   wishing you a seductive  wonderful day lick by luv  penetrate by heavenly grace  may all your misfortune be ejaculate  
amazing that the race of human being be  in ql one would find people from many nation voice their thought  concern of the society we all be part of  we always want our opinion to be hear  some people in reality maybe too shy to voice their opinion in person  so dears it different version for different people  end of the day if we could share a light moment at this place with someone unknown and if it bring a smile onto your face then why not ql

visas and permits maximum period of a visit visa  i m currently in doha on a 3 month visit visa  anybody can please tell me  whether i can extend this futher more  maximum of how many month  
maximum 6 months brother after that you have to exit from qatar  
after 6 month you can get an extension also   
i be on tourist visa for 1 month  can i also get extension  for how many month and how much  tnx a lot  
you ca n t get an extension  may be i could be wrong  but extension be valid for family visa holder  after they have clear their medical  
no extension for tourist visa i think  
ok  tnx a lot  do you know any company hiring for office staff  
you can also extend your tourist visa but very costly a compare with extend a family visit visa  maybe what you can do be exit from qatar then  after three month  apply again for a family visit visa  if you have a relative here  
you can extend a family visit visa for a maximum six month  but in any case that you have to extend it again after your 6 month limit  you can do that  too  i think upto 1 month  more  you just have to submit application form again to immigration with your flight booking detail  
hi rtaure tnx  what be the requirement in extend tourist visa and how much  if i exit  i can go back in qatar after 3 month  
you guy be mix family visit visa and tourist visit visa  family visit visa  when you be sponsor by one of your family member  initially be valid for 1 month  and can be extend later for another 5 month  total 6 month stay  after undergo medical examination  tourist visit visa be be valid for 30 day and can be extend for another 30 day  60 day stay in total  
moving to qatar moving from dubai to doha my family and i be move to doha in august  we want to bring our 2 jeep with u  i would like to drive both from dubai to doha  can anyone tell me the procedure and paperwork need  also  can i drive my wife s car or can a friend drive it for her  and finally can i bring some of our personal effect with u in the car  if anyone can help with these question that would be great  
doha to dubai  first  you can ship one of the car  i be tell it will cost about 2k qar aed  you will need to get a transit visa for the drive through saudi  and for this you will need a valid gcc residence visa  aside from this  i would have think that you just register the car with the ministry of transportation once you be here  but not sure if that involve anything different than what you would need for a car buy here   if your car be too old you wo n t be able to register it in doha  i think 2006 model be the old allow this year   no idea about the stuff but good question  i want to do the same  it would not have occur to me that this might be a problem  
i just move in here  if your visa will be cancel come august  then i think you can no longer drive it i try actually all the procedure  if you re plan to export it here through either recovery  truck  or ship  container  the first thing you ll do be go to traffic department  the easy and less crowd be the one near al wasl  10am be a good time to go there  they will get your vehicle for export test and you have to pay for 25 dhs  then if you tell them you ll bring it to truck company yourself  you ll pay around 80dhs for the export plate  blue plate  and they will get your old plate and also the registration of your vehicle  card   make sure too you cancel your salik  which have also a booth inside the building  here be the reminder  1   insist you ll take the car even with the blue plate  some of the guy will tell you to leave your car with them  with the blue plate  you can drive your car for 14 more day from the day you have the local plate cancel   
do n t suppose you know about the other way  be it pretty much the same go from doha to dubai  just out of curiosity  if my qatar visa be not cancel  ca n t i just drive it to dubai and go to their ministry of transportation to register the car  thanks  
hi cath  i m also plan to take my car from dubai to doha  however  i have a couple of issue  1  i just move to qatar a couple of week ago and have n t receive my resident permit yet because they tell me i have to cancel my dubai visa first  even though it s my own investor visa  2  i m go to dubai tomorrow to cancel my visa and then i be plan to come back in my car  will i be able to obtain the transit visa in saudi border if i have a canadian passport  3  if i get an noc from my employer in qatar  will that be sufficient to import my car from dubai to doha  4  will i have to pay the 5  tax if my car be 3 yr old  is there any way to avoid it  thanks in advance  noman 
hi  i m move to doha next week and would like to know if there s any tax or such when i send my box  they will contain clothes and a few appliance  non electric  for the kitchen as well a book  also  what company be best to use since it s only 3 box

hi my husband and i just go through the whole rp thing  we have to give 4 month worth of bank statement so you should double check  will save you alot of run around 
i be go to add  you good check with your company liason officer a to the bank statement  i think it depend on your salary as well because a friend be ask for a 6 month bank statement  
it depend on your company s pro c connection with the authority  i get family visa with 3 month bank statement  no water or electricity bill be produce  
some say 3 month  some say  4 month   maybe i will take chance for 3 months who know  if they reject my application  ill try 4 month  up to six month  be it possible    
better ask first your pro because some bank charge you per bank statement  cbq charge 50qr per bank statement be it 6  4  or 3 month  since they will charge me anyway  i get 6 month statement instead of just 3 to be sure

visas and permits changing your profession on residence visa my profession show in my residence visa be technician whereas in reality i be work a manager  i try to change my profession from technician to manager through our agent but for some reason he be say it be not possible  i have masters in business administration and masters in geology  i really wonder why this change ca n t be do  does any body have any suggestion of how to do this change  
to change the profession there be a charge of qr 550  he do n t want to pay for it that be the reason   
i do hav the same issue  it take my company mre tan a yr to get the profession change  ive also herd tat recently  they have put a report state it not possible to change the profession  im not sure of this  
my cmpny agree to change my prof  dnt knw how long will it take  but ofcos it be possibl wit high edu certficts  every lady hop that her daughter will marry a good man than she do  and be convince that her son will never find a wife as good a his father do    
i be ready to pay for the charge even it be 3000 qr so money be not a problem here but our sponsor here be say that immigration be reject the application for profession change 
 i use to be an electrician in my visa a we dont have a visa for professional way back in 2005  now it be stamp accord to what i do now in our company  it take them 2 week ot process it  they submit my authenticated diploma and noc from my employer    fascinated with supercars but can t afford it yet  so i settle down for a humble jeepney  proud noypi     
you can do it on your visa renewal  just submit your certificates diplomas  they have to change it for you  unless the company do n t have a visa for the certain positions nationals  coz before issue visa on particular name  company have to get an aproval for the certain nationality and position  and then they apply your name to this visa  
i have my profession change upon my renewal  but not the exact profession accord to my diploma since the company have no available visa for such position  i be plan to have it change again on my next renewal  i think i ve discover the secret of life  you just hang around until you get use to it  charles schulz 
it be important  get an noc from sponser  first get the application form for profession change  get your sponser sign  seal on that paper then goto labour dept  near to american hosp  along with  1  sponser id copy 2  munciplaity bill 3  edu  qual copy  should be transalted  4  bank stmt  6 month  5  aggriment contract  3 new   newly print  6  aggriment contract  3 old  already sign  7  your pp  visa and id copy  submit this and get sign from officer he be sit in 3rd floor  once you get the sign goto the near office for attestaion of your contract   new 3   while attestation you have to pay 50 qr  wait for another 10 day and get immigration office  garaffa  and show your receipt from labour by show them the new application for id change with your photo  then go buiding no  1 and submit your application there  you have to pay 300 qr  on the spot you will get your new id and visa sticker on your pp  go ahead good luck for you  i just change recently

hai guy i have be work in qatar since 1995 in a reputed company a a supervisor  the title of my visa be labor as uyou say it do n t make any difference until i try to bring my family here  because we be not able to bring our family if our visa in such title even we be work a a manager  i cancel my rp while i go on vacation and cameback in new visa a engineer  i hear that even we we can visit uae for 7 day if we have a engineer or doctor visa  not sure   
family life in qatar hamad medical card can somebody tell me how to get this card for me and my family  thanks  
hi i get my health card like 3 week ago in a walk in clinic  some where in doha close to the souk  but i dont remember the address  u have to bring copy of your passport and visa or qatar id with 100 riyals  it take like 4 minute once u be in the counter  but maybe it will be a 30 minute line  good service  bad infrastructure  
yeah  shanky be correct  just go to any of the phcs  carry a copy of ur id card  electricity or telephone bill for the late month and two photograph  give it to the lady on the counter together with the charge qr 100 for one year  she will issue one reciept and u can get ur card exactly after one month from the same counter  do n t go by weekend coz it will be rushy  it will be easy for u to go to the nearby phc where ur staying  
they issue the card the same day  within 5 minute only  i saw people with a receive a you say look for the card like they do before  but in my case the make it the same day  
thanks for the info anyway i live nearby to this children emergency  al sadd   be it consider a the phc  
they may do the paperwork there but generally  the phcs have the green sign out front  looks like a stop sign  
i have just have mine do last week  you need to go to your local clinic  one with green lollipop   mornings only  go as early a possible  take  fill in form  2 photo  copy of rp and passport  karama bill  100 qr for each person  it do not take me 5 minute  more like 1 hour   and 2 visit a i go in the afternoon the first time  you will be give a receipt which you can use instead of the card  the card will be issue after about 1 month  not a pleasant experience  
its on morning time  until 12  and a i say once you be in front of the counter take you 5 minute  but maybe 1 hour in line  some labor love to jump the cue  so be rude and tell them to do the line  
what happen if i do not have a electricity telephone or karama bill  because my bill be give by house owner in this case how can i get the health card  
take something else that show your address on it

advice and help dog relocation to doha from the u k klm have tell me my yorkshire terrier be able to travel in the cabin with me from the u k to doha  has anyone do this  2 pet relocation company have tell me i cant and im unsure whether they be tell me this to avoid get their fee or whether i have be misinform by klm  cost be not the issue  the wellbeing of our wonderful pet is i really want the most stress free method of travel possible for her  can anyone help  
dog be dog only 
dogs go in the hold in special container  
both klm and lufthanza allow you to bring pet from the uk  via netherlands or germany  in the cabin  the pet plus the carrier have to weigh under around 8kg  which should be fine for a small breed   price be surprisingly minimal  it be a fixed excess baggage charge of around 70  check with airline   the pet have to be transport in a carrier which fit under the seat  really only during take off and touch down   there be special soft carrier which have a tent like squashable roof which will fit under the seat and spring back up  the brand that spring to mind be sturdibag  good luck  btw i be tell about the airline by doha vets  who be amazingly helpful  and then check directly with the airline in the uk  who agree with this  
thank you so much for this information tiddsmum  have you have experience of animal travel this way yourself  i have check with klm who say exactly a you have  however when 2 company in the u k tell me this be not allow it leave me feel very deflate and wonder if it be maybe doha airport that dont accept dog travel this way  she be our daughter dog but be a very special part of the family and keep our teenager onside for this move be very important  i really appreciate your reply a i have try to obtain this through other blog  websites to no evail  all say cargo  excess baggage in hold  i will also contact doha vets who may be able to help with import certificate and help upon our arrival  
yes  call doha vets  they can clear this up for you  good luck  it be my impression that only lufthansa and maybe klm do this  mandi 
get in touch with dr khaled el hossan  khaled  dohavets com   he can sort all the paperwork out this end  the import licence be valid for 1 month  but it may be worth find out how long it take to get one in the first place  all you will need to do be sort out the export paper from defra at uk end  this be the link to the relevant contact  http  animalhealth defra gov uk about contact us tradeexports html oh  here be an example of the type of carrier  http  www zooplus co uk ask  q sturdi bag  num 20  form search  gclid cmbg7c2d468cfqt66wodhz7nwa this be all theory  i have be plan to bring out my elderly cat  who would have be too stress in the hold   but a we be not stay in qatar  will now not need to do this  hope it all go well for you and your daughter s dog  have to say though  august be an awfully brutal month to be bring the poor thing out there  hope it do n t have a full coat  
oh  just double checked my fact  pet  carrier have to be under 7kg  time to put your yt on a diet      the airline website will give you the maximum dimension of the carrier  but do not be put off by the height restriction  a these special carrier squash down to the maximum allow height 20 cm i think  
i do n t think that yt will qualify under this scheme  remember the weight of the pet carrier have to be 7kg or below 7kg  
yorkies average in at 2 3 kg  my cat be 4 kg and these carrier be design to be super light  for this exact purpose  bar chiuauas  i can not think of a lighter dog  it s worth purse anyway and dohavets and the airline be expert on this  so do n t be dishearten  you do n t get anywhere without try   
i m on a roll now  if you check the link i post  the type of carrier you will need weighs in at 900g  to go over the recommended weight allowance  that would have to be one hell of an obese yorkie

if you enjoy filipino cover band and lot of asian variety in the crowd then the qube be great  however if you enjoy more of the western flair you be down to garvey s  rugby club  and rydges  of these your best bet for fri and sat night  my opinion  so no flame from anyone  be go to be rydges  the bar be under new aussie management with the goal of much good music and faster service  this past weekend be quite busy and the music be good enough to dance to  so there you hav it  one recommendation 
go to beirut  thats where the clubing be i always tell the truth  even when i lie 
is pretty good on a thursday night  nice crowd of people and a good british band  not club though  for club there be only the pearl  with the awful dj jojo  and cloud nyn where the crowd be very very young  i guess if you want club you really do have to go to beirut  
 not good idea to come to have a party in qatar  qatar be a   muslim   country  muslims be not allow to drink alcohol  be in unnecessary co ed place  coming to qatar to have party be strange  maybe you could save money for other purpose other than party   
i agree with tyler and bbksiu  although the best way to enjoy your weekend in doha be by get together with friend in one of our house  have dinner  bbq  and drink  alcohol  you can buy alcohol if you have the license  play some game  e g  risk and card  watch the late dvd  you can put music on and dance  becareful your neighbor      and if you too drink to go home  your friend can get you a lift  or there always a taxi  so you not worry to get cought on drunk and driving  
someone agree with me  that never happen  perhaps i take my mediaction today and have a rare lucid think  p 
 amaru immortal  clubs  i mean night club  here in qatar be no comparison to what you d find in a non muslim country  they both serve alcohol  have music  live djs  but that s where the comparison end    where would you go for rnb and hiphop    take a plane and go somewhere else     i d suggest heat or mercury lounge in melbourne for rnb hip hop      bit of promotion from an ex employee  if you still wan na come to the middle east for clubbing  go to beirut or istanbul  maybe even cairo for that matter  or go to goa  india if you wan na spend xmas at trance party on the beach  or go pub hopping in bangalore    i hear that in qatar nobody go out on saturday  be that true    true  we go out on thursdays  that s the weekend here  happy hour start at 5 30pm   
it suck 
thanks for the info  i have friend in doha and they say that there be a rumour that two top london djs  one playing hiphop rnb the other playing house will be perform  if anyone have far info that would be great

well do gypsy  i be just gon na tell him to do a search  but your cut and paste do the same job  did you google it first

i do n t see the point in re writing what i d already write    
bars in doha  starting from rugby club move to marriott  include drink price  average nationality of customer  musical taste and  of prostitute  rugby club  similar to garveys only maybe 60  british  not a many rig pig and a lot more 16 year old  sometimes a dj play  never see any pro there either  nearly impossible to get into now if you don t have a membership  average drink price  15qr ramada  orion  located on the top of the new ramada plaza  it s 80  male  mostly indian arab  i ve never notice the music but i think there s a filipino band some night  average drink price  30 qr manhatten  tiny little bar also locate in ramada plaza  99  qatari men  average drink price  40 qr bubbles  50  men 50  woman usually in couple with a good line of qatari s hold up the bar  serves champagne cocktails and have a singer and piano player that play too loudly  average drink price  50qr sherazad  the sport bar in the old ramada  70  men  indian arab western  30  prostitute    
nicely do gypsy hhmmm   now which one be with the work girl eh  have a nice weekend cheers all   heard your wife leave you  how upset you must be  but do n t fret about it  she move in with me  
brutus  that s mention  look for percentage of prostitute  
mersure  soffitel  hotel 1st floor bar  mostly indians infest with load of chinese dolls   ban spoon feeding not me 
nice post gypsy                             
boy  gypsy  seriously  wow     
all females downstairs at cube be not prostitute you ca n t teach experience  
socialising cube     hey guy have you be to cube  i think it cool it just at the back of ramada hotel it like a night club  though i think it hard to get inside especially on thursday night i just find last night while make a detour you know the traffic  while i be drive i see this long line little do i know it a line to get inside this new club  do you think it own by ramada hotel  anyway it a good thing they be already permit build club  
i go tuesday  i thaught it be pretty poor tbh  lot of work woman and a bad philipino coversband play rock ballards of the 80  the design be interesting  nothing like a propper nightclub  far too bright  no disco light  very restrictive about upstairs couples vip area  it remind me of nightclub you see in american movies pretty synthetic and fake  i couldnt work out the booze pricing policy a bourbon and coke cost the same price a a coke  and everyone from work have rank hangover despite quit at 11 30 yes it own and staff by ramada  
the place be just too big that it do n t make the room pleasant  just my opinion though  
i go on thursday and have a good time with some friend  i think the band be pretty good  maybe i be hypnotize by the daisy duke short the singer be wear though  everyone that have go before me sum it up a feeling like a warehouse and it s mostly due to the white wall i think  kinda remind me of a high school dance in the gymnasium  buncha guy stand around leer at the girl  hopefully after the asian games they will take everyone s advice and at least paint the wall and dim the light to iimprove the atmosphere of the place  the ratio of guy to girl be about the same a everywhere else  10 guy to 1 girl  
it good place for me for hang out  lot of chinese and pilipina there and specially the performer the 3 beautiful sexy singer and their band great performance  that time i ll go there it be very great because i meet chinese lady and she offer me some deal    its good    
well if thats what you want to go to the doha night club for then thats your deal  night life in qatar hmmmm be there such a thing  from what i can tell they be full of philipino woman and old western men with a few other undesirable in  doha amongst many other city in the world have a lot to learn about night club  what make them good and what make them bad  predominantly what make them bad be the client that frequent them  in the case of doha they will always be bad  face facts if you get to a nightclub to pick up woman  of any culture  then your not in to club  
to the majority of people whom have attend real club  go for the music  to get dress up to impress not only others but themselves  many club be just institution to carry on drinking after normal club closing time and to pick up member of the opposite sex  real clubbing  is   music  dance not what have be describe on here  this be not just my opinion  there be many club web page  and you will find it hard press to find a description of what be describe on this forum  have you ever be to ibiza  grant the drug scene be far to prevalent there but it be all about fun music and dancing  not about pick up woman  
some good party though  sometimes  admirals  pearl  provide that there be enough alcohol in the blood  for club  well fly to lebanon  
you re right spoerry  for real club go to lebanon or wait for a lebanese to open a club in doha like what happen in dubai with c bar 
guys a lebanese club very nearly happen in one of the major hotel  unfortunatly the person in question leave qatar  he be a good friend and i know his plan and trust me it a complete shame it never go further     places like the buddha bar would go down a treat here  or something not quite so big a ministry of sound  liquid  pasha happy hunting  we all need the entertainment 
i cant believe this forum  the cube  a club  are people serious  ha ha ha ha i havent giggle so loudly for age  thanks for the humour  brainsalad you go there and some chinese lady offer you some deal  you be joke arent you i mean no one could be that seedy and be proud of it  dvargas you didnt enlighten u with your wisdom of club      anyone who know about club know it not about standard  it about the music  the dance the adrenaline  not about pull some sweaty speck who come up to you with his checked shirt and fetch gold necklace  thanks guy for make me giggle   the cube a club he he he

i think it should n t be take as just dance and drink for nightlife  i suffer from lackness of cultural event in doha  as i miss anatolian fire  madame butterfly under asian games event  i would like to see such entertaining performance more in doha  much more that if we can not find any place for one  we can go for the other  d for example  there be some nice place make wonderful fruit cocktail  why not play bowl while you drink  a big complex with bowling  billiard  electronic game for adult strongly require  about alaaddin s kingdom  it be the only theme park with nothing  it should be more inviting  with some little theatre show  animal show  high quality electronic video game  good food  some recreation near sea  in turkey  they make people to sit on camel for a little tour and take photograph  sorry i could n t see any camel since i come here  9 month   about sea side  doha have a wonderful corniche people just go and sit on grass  why there be n t some caf   
hey lianna  how you do girl  be you do with the diet center  what be the final score  you seem to have visit most of the joint  where be cloud nyn and admirals  happy heart drive safe because someone be wait for you at home 
thank god that there be not much food joint and cafe in corniche  otherwise the whole beauty would have be spoil  
what you mean by not much food joint on corniche  there be nothing on corniche even to buy a bottle of water  do you think i want to see burger king on corniche  no way    just one or two area to drink tea  coffee  juice  if they really want they can build something nice without destroy the beauty  thats up to the idea and imagination of the architect  
there be one near to sheraton or have you miss it

just go to the web site www cic gc ca  whatever u want u will find it there  if u want i read some promotion in gulftimes about consultant  but i do n t recommend any  
 immigration be process by the canadian embassy in uk  abu dhabi deal only with visitors tourists visa  you do not have to do the immigration through the lawyer or representative  but it always help  i will pm you later  check your inbox    img nid 94186 title desc link none align left width height 0     sun   be not the mother s child  but our galaxy s star    
can you copy furnish it to me  a i m plan too  thanks  live and die with dignity  jayter  
i recommend you do it yourself  consultants take too much money for do nothing  
 it s not really do nothing  yes  if everything be go smooth  then it s ok  not much work to do  but if there be some issue on the way  then people just get lose and start make mistake  and sometimes it s irrevocable    img nid 94186 title desc link none align left width height 0     sun   be not the mother s child  but our galaxy s star    
thanks for all your valuable comment  i agree with qatari sun  we a individual do not know whom to contact i guess they will not entertain in the embassy  consulate  in case of agent  they will be represent our case and act on your behalf  yes  at a high price though but i be still think    
as some of you have suggest  to apply for permanent residency in canada be pretty straight forward o majority of the case  the green card be only refer to permanent resident of the states  not canada  also  the color of the card for permanent resident card have be change to white color many yaers ago though most people still refer to green card  to qualify for canadian permanent resident visa  you need to accumulate a total of 67 point  use to be 75 point  which be base on your age  education level  profession  employment status  english proficiency  suitability  and among others  just go to the official canadian immigration website a state above and u will get all the info  god luck   
 dunno about the consultant  watched a special on the canadian news last summer where under cover reporter pay surprise visit to immigration   consultant   in toronto with question  i forget the number  but the majority be scam artist  they be mostly chinese prey on other chinese though  so you might not encounter so many in that specialisation here   
medengineer  go here http  www cic gc ca english index asp skilled worker and professional  who can apply six selection factor and pas mark will you qualify  if you be eligible to apply a a skilled worker  you will be assess on six selection factor and a point system  learn more about each factor by click on it education maximum 25 point ability in english and or french maximum 24 point experience maximum 21 point age maximum 10 point arranged employment in canada maximum 10 point adaptability maximum 10 point total maximum 100 point pass mark 67 point 
opportunities canada immigration anybody know an agency here in qatar where people can apply for canada  what be the best and fast process in migrate there  please advice  thanks  
 honestly if you can do the application alone the lawyer arent any faster  you just have to be persistant  lawyers will tell you that they have a special arrangmenet but it be baloney    diplomacy be the art of say nice doggie  until you can find a rock  will rogers    
thanks for the info amoud   be it really so  howabout go thru the consultancy office  
do n t matter what you be go through  canada immigration officer do n t care about it  he she be strictly follow the procedure  rule and instruction  and by the way this be the first thing you guy have to learn about canada  you have to be loyal and law obedient and rule respectful  no fool around  no playing game  no middle eastern trick and focus pocuses  if you have gain enough point on six factor  you become eligible to apply for the immigration  it doesn t make you a permanent resident automatically though   you become responsible forever for what you have tamed   antoine de saint exup ry 
you really dont need a lawyer to apply for immigration to canada though it ok to hire one  just look for people who have go through it to guide you in fill up the form and of course you have to do your own reading  i find out late so good get all the info in their website  http  www cic gc ca 
greentea  it s not necessary  but some assistance of the experienced individual might be very helpful  sometimes everything go smooth and easy  sometimes there be hidden problem on the way  filling up the application be a very first and easy step of the process  on the other hand  if the information provide in the application form be correct and truthful  and base on this information the person be eligible for the immigration process  it shouldn t be any issue with that  but sometimes some unpredictable thing happen  here be the example  5 point be give for the relative in canada  let s say the applicant have a sister who possess a resident status in canada  while fill in the application  the applicant add 5 point to his score  and it help him to get 67 point  but  once the immigration office ask for the document to prove the claim in the initial application  and then it turn out  that a sister doesn t live in canada at all  she live  let s say in   
 honesty on the application be a different matter  thats down to moral and common sense  a lawyer or consultant be not all that helpful  if you have question about the application you can usually find it on the site  if any question arise the embassy will call you  also dont believe them when they say their client never get interview  these be also random and if you be on the up and up no worry  a lawyer consultant will cost you between 2000 3000   totally not worth it  just make sure you have all the required doc etc together and understand the process from the site before apply    diplomacy be the art of say nice doggie  until you can find a rock  will rogers    
hi  qatarisun  you seem to be expert in this matter  can i ask how much duration be require for a permanent resident to get the citizenship  one who have n t take risk have n t live 
 if you get residency you need to live in canada for 2 year out of 5  if you dont meet the time requirement you have to reapply for residency    diplomacy be the art of say nice doggie  until you can find a rock  will rogers    
my lawyer give me the form to fill up then send him back the form and the document to go with it  later he meet me again to review the fill up form  in adobe format this time  then if entry be correct and no change make  i sign it then send it back to him again  after a few month  he send me the file number  that s it for 2 year i do not hear from him again  i just have to check the website for the status of my application use my file number  the next time i hear from him  he advise me to download again the same form from the website and fill it up  sign  follow the list of exhibit to be submit that be not yet submit earlier then submit direct to high commission of canada within 90 day from the date the letter be issue  good thing i make a photocopy of my original document to avoid discrepancy  so basically  in the end you still have to send updated form direct to the high commission 
i be an expert in a lot of issues  just lazy to express my knowledge  opinion and thoughts  lol  you have to live in canada 3 year out of 4 to be eligible to apply for the citizenship  it mean if you don t leave canada for 3 year at all  then you can apply  in case you go back and forth  you have to collect 1095 day during 4 year  you won t be able to apply for the citizenship  until you collect 1095 day during last 4 years   you become responsible forever for what you have tamed   antoine de saint exup ry 
moving to qatar australia and canada  which country be the best for immigration and why  q234 
 i do n t understand the question  surely you must have decide before you apply why you want to go to a particular country  if it be just to have a   western   passport who care  canada be cold for much of the year  austalia be warm but have some   hotspot   sometimes  this be not a very specific question  to be honest  if you be go to any other country other than to reside there permanently  you be not emigrate for legitimate reason  you be emigrate to get the passport  what be the matter with your birth country s passport   
for residence point of view canada be good but for job oppurtunity australia be good but from the current scenarion in australia on india if your indian you should not go but if you be some other country citizen you should go to australia 
canada for sure 
marycatherine  what be wrong with you  if you do not understand let those who understand answer  you can also ask question to understand because we lean and understand by ask question  dont judge people please i hope you understand this  
canada suck big time     really cold and not good for outsider   big racism issue too  
mmyke  you probably mix canada with some other country  in canada any expression of racism be a punishable crime  and i agree with marycatherine  if you do n t know where you want to go  why do you wint to go there   it be nonsense  i hope both canada and australia will start differ those who want to live in the country from those who want to get a passport  
every country be get strict on their immigration  recently australia have announce some insane change in their immigration policy   every country require that one should live in it country but people use to live anywhere else after get immigration  now they realize and change their policy and force immigrant to live in the country otherwise they will not renew the residency  but i be think if they do not increase their birth rate and skill set  they have to soften their policy for immigrant   
qatarisun    i be bear in the first european settlement north of the virginias  and the first in what be now know a canada  in a place originally call port royal  now name annapolis royal  circa 1604  population be still about 800 people  and extremely beautiful  i be sorry and i apologise if i make you think that i do n t know what be go on in canada  thanks and all the best  michael 
very much depend on your reason for migrating  is it economic opportunity  education  life style and anything else not the least  which country will accept you  as general rule  for economic migrant  i assume you be  apology if wrong  from ghana  your profile   both be good  never live in canada so i can not comment but for australia a someone else mention  there be a bit of resistance from earlier migrant  after all australian aside from the indigeous people be migrant or convict at some stage of history  about allow more to come  basically it affect mid level skilled person tradesman such a cook  hairdresser  carpenter  electricians etc  for high qualification  engineer  doctor   i believe the door be still open  cheers sk btw  if you decide to go to australia  you do not need to enggage the service of a migration agent  they mostly act a an administrative assistant  ie  remind you of which document to submit etc  and have no impact on your selectibility  
qatarisun and marycatherine  be you try to give me bad impression about canada people or what  i think you be try to do that but you can not because you do not represent canada people in this forum  actually i know some good people from canada and they tell me more about canada  but i just ask this question to hear from foreigner who live in canada before or still live there  this be because foreigner experience in a country can not be the same a that of citizen  i be wonder why you think i want to immigrate to canada  or go there for passport where didn t i mention that  it be very funny hahaa does my question about immigration mean that i want to immigrate to canada  why don t you that it could be research purpose or any other thing else  i don t think we should think one way  especially when we have job tile like teacher or manager etc we shouldn t think like someone who hasn t be to school  i want to repeat again don t judge peop

advice and help canada or australia migration this be for my brother who be work a an it professional in dubai   he be plan to migrate to canada or australia  but he be still not sure where to migrate   i would really appreciate if somebody who have experience in this could give valuable suggestions  is canada or australia a good place to migrate   pls give ur valuable advice and suggestion  
 trust me on this stay in the gulf and make lots money  i know lot of people who leave good position and job here just to experience the whole   canada   life and then start repent  so unless u have truck load of money dont think of migrate to these place      smoke      
www cic gc ca and look for simplify skilled worker application form and download it fill it up sign it  and send it to the embassy in dubai with 550cad  almost 550 usd   later on  he will be ask to send his document  no need to send any doc before they ask for it  
depends on what he want  canada be next to the u s  have a high migrant population  but be extremly cold for part of the year  australia have great weather  lay back people  but be far from anywhere else  
try good guatemala oh honolulu   img nid 94788 title desc link none align left width height 0  sun and i 
if save money be not a important anymore for your brother  he can migrate to any of these country  consider britexpat suggestion in choose which country to migrate to  but otherwise  stay here in the gulf  earn more and save more  although consider that life in gulf be only good til u retire or ur contract expire  if ur host country do not kick u out   then u have to go back to ur homeland and bid d gulf and ur friend farewell 
smoke  do not agree i can earn more in oz for my job   
yes  smoke be right  you can definitely take his advice  my friend be have very big canadian dream  he know about the initial 3 year struggle  he be well prepared mentally as well a physically also with a strong financial back up  he be ready to do any kind of odd job  which you have to do in canada a your educational qualifiaction beomes simply 10 2 as soon a you land in there  my friend be a well settle dentist in india  he just could n t get any dental assistant job too  he never ever yold u that what he have to go thru in his 4 month stay in toranto  he come back to india after 4 mths with a huge hole in pocket  again after complete a costly course in gemology  he go there to try his luck again  and this time too he return after 2 month again with a huge hole in pocket  i be not write this to discourage your brother  this be ground reality one must know before proceed for it  still i know those too who have go thru all the struggle and now be well se   
well well well  a topic that i have be thru  trust me man  a smokey say  only if you have money and lot of it think of migrating  it isnt a cake walk exactly up there or down under  lots of tax system which be the big killer  so take your decision base on the fact that u either have lot of money or you dont make any money when u go there lol simple  
family friend of ours  the whole family  migrate to canda about 10 year back  the parent think it be extremly cold  they be basically from south india which be more or less tropical   the kid do their college education there and love it there but the family be back in india although the kid be canadian citizen now and want to return  the dad be work in qatar petroleum for at least 15 year before they migrate so they must ve save a lot of money before they go  upto you dude  i donno abt australian though  
 what r u talk about    he know about the initial 3 year struggle     but   he come back to india after 4 mths   and   he return after 2 month again    what a nonsense   and how do you think hundred of thousand of immigrant make it    if all of them go   back to india after 4 month    no immigrant would live in t o  by now  lol   and for the doctor and lawyer everywhere be the same rule  you have to start your study all over again  or at least to do a very very very difficult exam before your practicing  which be absolutely right   norms and standard be different in different part of the world  please understand it  it people s health and life in their hand  every normal government want to make sure it have do accord to it rule and regulation   and how many people can not find a job here in qatar either     and if you know   someone   who could n t succeed  it do n t mean other thousand and thousand of immigrant can not succeed either  and     
advice and help  canada recruitment i meet one of the person here in qatar through the gulf times advertisement  recruit the skilled worker to canada  the recruiter company name be   m98world    how i wil check whether this one be fake or not  they are ask for 1500 qr for the visa processing also they inform a this process will take 10 month after the registration  so any one have any idea to verify this recruitment  there office be locate just opposite side of the al safa hotel near the jaida bridge   
hello  for my information canada immigration process take from 2 to 3 year minimum    also require some skill ielts 6  and bank credit   etc  so take care 
scam  mandi 
my collegue be work a journalist and he s planning to go to canada  i can assure you what prince ahmed say  take care they seem to be scammer 
you do n t just pay for a visa of any kind  except perhaps a visit visa  to canada  and you deal with government office and agency  not recruiter if you want to be sure you re not be overcharge or cheat  
two of my friend already get a job offer in canada thru online and without give any penny  if there ask for some payment i think it a scam  
i would strongly suggest you skip the recruiter  you can fill in all the document on your own  look for the canadian embassy in kuwait in google and you will find all that you need there  unless you have lot of money  skill that be in demand  and paper to prove your qualification   or be a refugee  it be very difficult to get in to canada  it can take year for the paper to get through so if someone have tell you 10 month  that be probably completely unrealistic  
if you have the skill a company require in canada they will obtain the work permit for you  this be almost certainly a scam  
where all the trust have go from this world    god bless all    
hello oslec2011 if it ok if i can get the site where your friend apply for job in canada   thanks 
agents be truly helpful for any person who be not too much into computer  some be not have credit card  so on   
family life in qatar where i can find a reliable birth tourism company that ll help u have our baby in canada  we re interested in have our baby in canada  i d like to see if anyone out there have do it too  
 there be no such thing a birth tourism in canada  in fact  you will probably either be deny a visa or turn away at immigration if there be any suspicion that you be there solely to give birth  this be an immigration   scam   because canada confers nationality on child bear in canada  but reserve the right to deport the parent  be very careful  there have be case where the baby get to stay  but the parent have to leave   
why do n t you have your baby in your country  
 another issue  how about the hospital cost  just to   sit   in a hospital bed a a non canadian cost about cad1500 day  on a ward with 9 other people  not be see by a doctor  no food  no medicine  no treatment   that s nearly 5000qar day before treatment  can you afford this   
do such thing exist  
yes it does exist and it still be legal to have your baby both in the states and canada a a visitor anyone who be bear in usa and canada be automatically deem to be citizen regardless of the parent s status or residency or citizenship  there be such agency back home in hong kong  singapore and seoul  just type it on google i be sure you ll find a few  young asian couple be really into this idea  in fact  my young sister do it in canada about a year ago  so my niece have become canadian by birth and have get a canadian passport  neither my brother in law nor my sister be canadian resident or citizen at the time of birth  the ob gyn  the housing and the hospital all cost them around 30 000usd  they do it in toronto and stay in a furnished home for three month  my si say everything go good and that they never be treat badly just because they happen to have a baby there a non residents  so i think it s for sure worth do if you want the us or canadian citizen   
it be not legal to operate a a birth tourism company to have a child in canada  canada confers citizenship automatically on baby bear there not on their parent who can and are deport  thereby separate family  this is a scam to try and gain access to canadian citizenship by circumvent the immigration rule and regulation by have a baby in canada  immigration in canada be well aware of this and do take step to circumvent it  again  i ask  why do n t you want your child to have your nationality  
we just want the citizenship for our baby  we think we can offer the cost that come with this  btw  i be well aware of the fact that only my baby get the citizenship by birth not u  the parent  so in this case  there be no scam that i get drag into  
i would be very careful  canada immigration do not look kindly on those who try to get citizenship for their child in this way  they will be ask hard question at the immigration desk and if you ca n t answer them  you re on the next plane out

moving to qatar personal loan and work termination i be currently work here in qatar  our employer inform u that they will transfer to contractor with less salary  but we have option not to accept  but the problem be i have personal loan in one of the bank here in doha  what if i will not accept the offer  what will happen to me  i mean do the bank will force to pay or not  
haha  so you want to get away without pay the loan  
not really  but iam just curious what if the company be the cause of termination  
yes  but your loan and contract be with the bank  
you mean even the cause of termination be the company  the bank will force me to pay   and wat if i find new job with less salary war will happen do they reduce my monthly fee  
i be sure you can renegotiate the repayment with the bank  
ah okay  because i be just worry  but not pay and run from my debt be not my option  i do believe in karma  thanks for the info  
you re welcome  i hope it all work out for you  
fact  if your company terminate you  take that letter to your bank  you wo n t be require to pay any remain amount  bank will use it tact  do n t yield  after few day of delay  finally you will get clearance from bank and fly home  insurer of your money  bank would pay that amount to bank  may be insurer and bank be have office in the same building  or manager be cousin  they be after your money  so escape clear from both party  pray hard  good luck in find another job soon somewhere  regards  
would you believe if i say 1000 have leave without repay a single coin in case your company terminate you  what for you pay premium every month my friend  
this be interesting  i do not know this  to be honest  i be surprised that this be possible  but good for those who have bank loan  
qatar living lounge why is many qataris  driving not satisfactory to many expatriates  i would like to know what make many qataris drive a problem  list your idea  please  land transportation be a real problem in qatar  
it seem to be an attitude of be able to get away with anything  i do n t know if that be accurate but it what ive see  the driving here be awful  
they do n t have to do simple thing like test to get a liscense  they be give the key to massive suv s with little or no experience acutally drive a vehicle  they have little or no respect for traffic law or anyone else on the road  they have speed issue in that anything under 120 km an hour be two slow  there be no way that the woman have any side vision in their veil  they have no idea how to actually drive in a round about  that enough  i could go on  
munozchick  here in doha when you drive the big the good attitude  and when you break the law you will rely who you know to get away from it  
how long have you be in qatar  i do not think you have be here long   if you be new and you drive  then wait and see a few land cruisers cut you off  make your heart come to your mouth with their speed limit break speed and piss you off by flash their light behind you in the fast lane and honking at you at roundabout like they get shit in their pant  i have be here for 15 year and i have not see anything change with regard to the way qatari s drive  like munozc mentioned it s a downright attitude problem  they just think  i can drive in my country the way i like and get away with it  you drive and be careful and weep when you try to mess with me  i have friend who have have skirmish with these guy at time and they have insult them and even go to the extent of try to hit them when they have be prove wrong  right in front of the cop  one indian friend be insult so bad that the qatari guy say you indians be at par with my shoe an   
yes  and this make it doubly gob smacking to be hit with a you re cop  park ticket outside hamad hospital this week for park on the kerb  200 yard away from the entrance  i simply need to catch up with my son who have arrive in an ambulance   surreal stuff and so unfair      
the flash light thing really irks my nerve  i stay in the lane when they do it  if someone drive up behind me and they do n t flash their light or get right on the back of my car  i move  i have respect for the patient people here  i m a fast driver but these people be nuts  i drive fast when i know i have a clearing  i have see people speed through compound  i find it nice that when you re on a 2 lane road and there be a bit of a wait at the r a  people make 4 lane  crazy  
they  many qataries and many expatriate  be a danger to other road user  and the authority do nothing to ensure road safety  
it would be good if the police  or traffic police  first follow proper driving techniques rules  ie  1  hand free phone or preferable park and then speak on the phone  2  follow speed limit  3  not drive over footpath in private cruiser with uniform on  4  immediate fine to anyone drive while hold the phone  or child on driver lap  or driver with foot on the dashboard  or without seatbelt  5  point system should be start in qatar a most of the people break the law have the necessary fund  the list can go on  these be the one i think need immediate attention  the first three point apply to the police  
in fairness it s not just the qatari s that be poor driver  but alot of expat as well  allowing your child to roam around in a moving vehicle be not only dangerous  but stupid  road accidents cause 62 death in seven month doha  the death toll in road accident in the country be high at 62 between january and july this year and a total of 107 people be leave critically injure  a local arabic daily report yesterday cite figure from the department of traffic and patrol police  a majority of the death  36  occur in the satellite township of al rayyan  follow by madinat khalifa  18  and old airport area in doha  05   at least 700 case of road accident be refer to the court over the seven month period  a total of 6  654 accident take place during the period  while minor accident totallled an incredible 26  697  please  wear seat belts  buckle up your child and drive safely    
they be taught wrong as well for a start my friend take her test over here and be tell that she need to drive with one hand a you need the other one for your mobile    wtf     they do not use lane  they do not stop at the end of road what else can i say  and it be not just qatari s either i think it be mainly indians myself

hi mandi  al fardan towers be on the list but havent heard of asas or falcon till now  will definitely check them out  i see youre still here  you be super helpful a year ago when they first start talk to me about this gig  how be thing  s  as a matter of biology  if it bite you it s probably female  
falcon towers be my favorite  but see also beverly hills towers in west bay  and i m do great  thanks  sitting at home with about 8 inch of snow  more to come  but i ll be back in doha wednesday  mandi 
asas be nice i have a couple of friend who live there  beverly hills be nice too  a be the w residence  i second mandi  just go to their office and do n t bother with an agent  you ll get a good offer that way  
chuckling here   snow  ah no thanks   jfk and ohare be bad enough  weather here be nice  come back     olive  you happen to know the asas website by chance   as a matter of biology  if it bite you it s probably female  
yup  http  www asasqatar com asassite index html 
awesome  thanks for the site olive pictures look great and will check it out this weekend   thanks   ps  to anyone else hit this thread  initial reaction after call with craig from mirage  re agent who post in ql  be very positive  responded to a single post here in ql with a call half a day later  call be very easy and he understand exactly what i be request  follow it up with confirmation of same in several email that same day  calling off corporate relo agent to see how mirage play out  so far very impressed   as a matter of biology  if it bite you it s probably female  
chuckling  or i could just look out my window from the bloody ezdan   lol i think google earth must be the devil   as a matter of biology  if it bite you it s probably female  
the westbay cc area be pretty small  so you should be able to drive yourself around and visit each building   maybe a dozen building  i think they all have onsite management that can show you what be available  personally  i think the pearl and falcon towers adjacent to the 4 seasons hotel be the best unit and best locate especially if you be able to join the four seasons spa  health club  al farden tower  where the bmw dealer be locate  be very nice  but no balcony if that be important to you  44 westbay tower also have very nice unit and great view from the upper floor  the residence at the w hotel be also quite nice  but no balcony  
aye  would definitely prefer a balcony if available but not a deal breaker   as a matter of biology  if it bite you it s probably female

buying a pet show you ve get money  adopt a pet show you ve get heart  
lol so i have no heart  i just know wat i want and cant seem to find it anywere so look in a store maybe my only option  plus it not people like me that keep them open im not a pet store inspector  maybe they shud do there jo a lil well   
pet store inspectors in this part of the world  be you serious  
you re waste money if you buy a cat kitten from the pet shop  most often  these poor creature be not feed properly  sick and by the time you get them  you ll be spend lot of money take them to the vet  and eventually they will die  we re tell you coz we know  but if you really want a headache  go ahead  just dont come around moan that you ve be dupe and fleece by these pet shop owner

doha shopping parrot hi all i need to buy a parrot any help for good price   thx 
in al nasr street there be one shop deal with all kind of bird in front of turkia central restaurant 
thx do u know abt price  
please do n t buy from the pet shop in doha  they be renowned for their poor treatment of animal and supply of illegal animal  buying from them be support this  
no bcoz we r unexperienced in this criterion 
i can only support tallg s post  
have you guy visit pet shop in al nasser  it really filthy and it stink  aquarium be not well taken care of  cat crap on the cage  etc  cheer  paul 
right tallg  but those poor animal be in the pet shop have a very bad life there  i really feel sorry for them  the best would be to have pet shop with normal condition for animal  why can  they do it here  it s true that have working have n t kill anyone yet  but why to take risk  
a parrot be a lifetime investment  these creature can live for many decade and could conceivably outlive you  so if you want to take on this really big commitment you may want to look for a very healthy bird  not one from a pet shop a tallg and md recommend  price should not be the major criterion in a long term  commit care taking relationship with a beloved pet  mandi 
very well say mandi  cheer  paul 
herne  obviously it s hard not to feel sorry for the animal in the pet shop  but the bad thing you can do be take pity and buy them because that will only exacerbate the problem  since it give the shop owner a profit and the incentive to go and get more stock  
half sister can my half sister apply a family visit visa for me  
qatar living lounge any favour for qatar bear expatriate  well  as far a the western country be concern they be give special care for the expat bear there  i doesnt seem to happen here in qatar from the government point of view or i may dont know any such favour kindly reply with ur experience please   
absolutely nothing  0  
do n t expect anything     this be qatar  you wo n t get any benefit  not even if your grandfather be bear here too  we all live under the same sky but we do not all have the same horizon  
the new born child in doha will be issue two year resident visa for free if parent have resident visa status here  thats all you get 
i m so agitated that i juss dont want to comment  
oh please dont even think of it being bear here givs nothin   so forget abt it  
two of my grandkids  twin  be bear in qatar and they gain no benefit  to the contrary  if they in turn have child bear outside the uk  those child will not be guarantee british passport  be warn  
the person bear here can get a job in royal force army 
air force   do you mind  
if a female qatari marry a non qatari male  their child will not receive any benefit that qatari s receive except a passport even if they be bear and raise in qatar   tra la la 
 i find this so strange  should n t you beable to get the passport of the country you be bear in  i mean  if you be bear in canada you be canadian  that simple    i fight with love and i laugh with rage  you have to live light enough to see the humor and long enough to see some change    ani difranco  
politics quraan teachers i be look for a quraan teacher  or perhaps a good school for memorisation  perhaps someone can help me with this  does anyone know if class be give in the mosque around doha for this as well  i be particualrly interested in the umar bin khattab masjid  
 welll  i think there be halaqa in masjed umar  ask any imam there they must know about it  many masjeds have   tahfeeth   system too  just go there and ask them    good luck   
aisha what be halaqa n what be tahfeeth  happy heart drive safe because someone be wait for you at home 
i forget to mention early that i be look for ladies only class    it seem there be many class but primarily for men  halaqas be when people get together to disucss religion  learn new thing together  etc  tahfeeth be the arabic word pertaining to memorize the mushaf  hope that clarifies those word for you  
thankyou faz    but you mention another new word now  mushaf  what do it mean  be it passages of the quran  be you look for halaqa in arabic or someone who can help with english a well most mosque would have it in arabic  i would presume  happy heart drive safe because someone be wait for you at home 
i seee  then for woman there be plenty  ask awqaf  for each earea there be a closer center  dar   i know that eid charity  near land mark  have one  i prefer charity because it s not every day there  only 3 day a week  i dunno if they change now  if you re not busy  then join a dar  you ll learn more there if you like to compete  go for the dars  
absolute pleasure    mushaf be the copy of the quraan  i be look to do tahfeeth  not join a halaqa  i do n t speak arabic  and that be pose to be a slight problem    
ask any islamic center here  they know  i ve hear a lot about shiekh bilal philips  he give course  
yes of course  i ve be in tahfeez  there be many sister there who do not speak arabic but be learn quran  bless them  
yea  where have you do tahfeeth  
for female awqaf have arrange centre for hifz in different area  i know there be one in abu hamour area and hilal  for male i think you can check the main mosque in you area  uaually it there right after asr prayer for 1 1 2 hour for kid  sometimes they do allow adult also to study there  i think in umar khattab it will be there  
socialising qatari men and western women ok guy i be go to prehaps tick someone off again but i have a question  not sunny but me  will a qatari man go out with a western christian girl  have sex with her and then move on because he think woman from the west be wild and sex crave  sunny have receive quite a bit response from qatari men who want to date her once we arrive  i even get an offer myself  but i believe it be a trap and i tell sunny be careful  any advice out there  
it be a very rare qatari man that would want anything more than what you just describe  it be a very rare man in qatar that want anything more to do with a western girl than you just describe  meeting men here be like step through a minefield  9 out of 10 of them just want sex  and they will do and say anything to get it from you  i be not bitter  i do not hate men  but i have be live in various part of asia for the last 2 and a half year  trust me when i say if you do not want to get burn be very careful who you date  asian opinion of western woman be not very high when it come to sex and dating  tell sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first  
if you be not look for a long time relationship  go for it  when it come to a question of sex  nationality  religion do not matter  that be my humble opinion  angelo 
i must tell you redcajun504 arab youth can go to any extent to get sex  but so be men from any country  men have always sex on mind  it be always advisable to be cautious  but why be you worry  there be a huge expat population here  which include indians  europeans  americans and even australians  so  it s not a problem basically  ask sunny to be prudent and approach the thing casually  without any pre conceived notion  though caution be utmost require  you never know you may actually get a gem of person among these arabians  after all  many of them have marry westerners  but dohagirl a such be correct that youth here always look for sex  on my own experience i must tell you they see russians  lebanese and filipinos a someone always available for sex  actually  this part of the world have many prostitute from these community  throng star hotel  use your common sense and thing will be cozy for you  i wish you and your sister best of luck  ambrish  ambarishjha  gmai   
life be not easy if you be a western woman  and the main reason a man from this part of the world would want a western woman be mainly for sex  however  please do not for one moment think that the men and woman here co n t have premarital relationship  they do it just not talk about and it be not caried out in the open  due to the conservative background of the boy they will always return to their family and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the family would not be happy about it  i think it be much good to be very cautious out here although there be a great many handsome men and they can be very charm go through the arab and asian world of men they be all interested in sex  one of the thing be that be find to be together whoc ae not marry can get into very deep trouble here  just a little food for thought  
sadly this have be the case for many year  maybe it originally stem from the day when arab have load of money  visit capital city  mainly in the west  and be naturally surround  a they be rich  by hooker  word spread when they return that they have be with western woman  the assumption would then be make that all western woman be loose  that be the assumption that we come to many year ago  rather like the western men go to thailand 
thanks dweller you have be fair  dg your point be sensible i tried to see if the shoe fit on the other foot and it same ironical    lol   it be a very rare western man that would want anything more than what you just describe  it be a very rare man in the west that want anything more to do with a asian girl than you just describe  its impossible to believe that the thousand of cripple shake 70 year old western men move with 21 year old asian beauty do so  because the guy be so romantic  love and responsible that the girl fell head over heals in love with him  i have see western men in various part of asia for the last 2 and a half year  trust me when i say if you do not want to get burn be very careful who you date  western opinion of asian woman be not very high when it come to sex and dating  here i actually mean woman from china  phillipines and thailand easy prey for western men in other country south asia and middle east woman be not availabl   
i am an unmarried indian from kerala looking for a life partner of any nationality aged below 40 unmarried divorcee widow serious in getting married to a true man are most welcome to mail me immediately no demands  
 hey be this   gineeshlee   geniune or a virus  seen this post a couple of place today   
why don t you date our friend here  gineeshlee  he want more than sex  or so it seem  anyways  on a serious note  i ve see too many fat red drunken western turists around here lately  and you know what  qataries be much good behave than that  at least they be rich and handsome  and don t get completely drunkenly smash in public  so don t worry about date them  thing be  if you behave like a slut  all men will treat you like a slut  if you behave like a lady  chance be that you might find someone that treat you like a lady  
 redcajun504  is this your first time date or deal with man  is n t it a fact that generally man  of any nationality  always try to get into woman s pant  you discuss this issue like you re from the outer space  if all this date stuff be too complex for you  sunny  my advice be go for   gineeshlee    he s the safe bet   
qatari culture can qatari girls allow marry indian     why arab girls not get marry indian man 
if the indian man be hindu  no  it s not allow  mandi 
so qatari female qler answer you that why they dont marry you  
give u some really knockout reason why we should  we re very picky so you ll have to be very persuasive                     
im go to be honest and blunt  i think it because most qatari woman dont find indian men very attractive  im just tell you what i think  im a qatari man and to be honest i dont care where your from it depend if i like you enough  
lol whitefeather  do n t go upset him now                      
                   
i mean no harm  p just type my thought  
 qatari lady  be never be allow to marry any foriegner even to any arab  so why wonder  qatari ladies be bear to marry gulf men only  but i know one  the father of the lady be half indian  and the father  arrange a marriage to her for an indian groom but i be not sure if the indian be allow by the government to stay here or even live here  the lady be qatari  her grandmother be an indian  but many qatari men be marry to an indian lady  i know alot    there s nothing we can do to change the past  if it teach you a lesson profit from it then  forget it     
if that the case  i wonder why the indian movie cinema hall be fill with qatari women  even men  if there be no liking for indian men or shall i say indian actors why be that most of the qatari women see first day first show of indian movies  the curiosity kill me  
be a god fear down to earth person  not be proud just wana share that i have be close to a few  its just that i be not a qatari or a muslim which they only find out after i tell them  or else i would have be marry to one by now  1 thing to appreciate qatari woman know how to respect their men  all other woman too know it  but see a lot in women here compare to their guy  
doha shopping only for ladies i be n t sure where to post this  have any of you try body sugar  can you recommend a place that will be gentle to beginner  not too painful  not too judgmental  not too expensive  
be that like wax epicurean  
what s that  
i think so  although i ve see it where the halawa be in a pliable lump that be apply and remove at the same time  
ohhhhhhhh watz that    hearin first time  
body sugaring be a method for remove body hair that be a cheap  homemade alternative to wax  or shave   the theory behind body sugaring be that the hair be remove by the root  and when it grow back there will be less of it  and it will be soft and not stubbly a it be if a razor have be use  body sugaring be do by make a paste of sugar  water  and lemon juice that have be heat to the softball candy stage  http  www care2 com greenliving ancient egyptian body sugaring html  sounds painful already   
i just do it at home   
it do n t sound any different to wax   when you look at the texture of the wax use in salon s here  i see a grainey look to it   think it might already be in use in most place    
when you pull the hair from your body  it gon na hurt  p 
xena  i understand that it s go to hurt  but a colleague s wife offer to do it for me and she use the veet strip  ended up remove more skin than hair  if such thing be possible  and i spend the next couple of day peel my skin and still have to shave  i figure maybe she do it wrong  or maybe i m just to delicate  
if u knw da method y dnt u do it at home 
qatari culture qatari wedding secrets  okay im not sure if this be appropiate  a i be not try to offend anyone  but i keep hear some middle eastern people tell me that the qatari wedding be know for get down and dirty  behind all these smile  no one tell me what this mean    what the heck happen at these wedding     i would really like to know  
i ve only be to one  but if you mean dull a dogshit when you say down and dirty  than i guess thats right  the party be separate into two group  men and woman  and there be no alcohol  at least at the womens party  they dance to loud disco music and dress scantily for other woman while critizing what every other woman be wear  not exactly the great party of all time  
doha girl   be u call our wedding dogshit    the least u can do be show respect in the country ur in        by the way  u ca n t judge wedding here by attend only one   im a qatari and i attend soooo many wedding and this be how it be here  no alcohol  no mixing if u want alcohol and what ever u have in mind then find what please u somewhere else    scantily dress u say  a i say u cant judge all wedding by just one  it depend on the wedding and family  oh and whats wrong with dance 2 loud music   dont u do that every now and then just in a diffrent place   
hello bobo  i dont exactly know what u mean   i ve be to so many weddings  it be nothing like down and dirty  sorry bobo   
 the men s part of the wedding be pretty straight forward  invitees congratulate the groom and his father  brother  you sit next to him for the traditional coffee and tea  have a picture take with him  later on there s a buffet and an   ardha   which be a traditional sword dance  very nice  beautifully decorate garment  after that groom go to the woman s party and join the bride  at least these be my first hand observation  there s no   down and dirty   part there   
 qatar girl   dull a dogshit   be an expression  i do n t mean your wedding be dog shit  i mean they be bore   
the internet be international territory  i have be to several and i agree with dg  obviously i be in the lad section 
dig away dg  
well super it be slightly more interesting than the korean wedding i go to  at least it have a party afterwards  and i hate loud music and dance unless i m drunk  so a qatari wedding be n t my idea of fun  so sue me  i ve say lot of nice thing about qatar and qataris but there wedding be not fun by my standard of fun wedding  
qatari wedding be not fun  the woman party be there so that the prospective mother in law could select future wife for their son  i be at a loss what men party be for  to be honest  
no drinking and importantly no single woman in romantic mood with 10 glass of champagne in them  nah barely any point go 
qatari culture which language be spoken in doha what be the spoken language in doha be it urdu or arabic  please let me know a website where i can learn the spoken language in doha  
we spreak arabic in qatar but english be also widely speak  plenty of urdu speaker too   love be the answer  
doha be a cosmopolitan city all the language be speak here but the main be arabic  english  malayalam  and hindi in this order  if you ca n t change your fate  change your attitude  
i guess the spoken word here in doha be arabic  however  not unless you speak the language of people of different nationality  indian  asian  westerners   english be your best option  my two dirham worth of opinion    what you be be what you have be  and what you will be be what you do now   buddha 
thanks for your opinion  i can speak hindi  english and telugu and can understand malayalam as well  please let me know any good website where i can learn arabic language  
you would not have much problem here if you could speak english  hindi  some qataris could undestand english as well a hindi  
some qataries understand malayalam also  2 day back my friend meet his company sponsor first time  he be a sheikh and start talk in broken malayalam  my friend reply in english and the sheikh shout at him and say talk in your language   
do n t hate me diamondgirl  this certainly do not apply to everyone  but my personal experience here in doha be that most do not speak english  even people who be not local and come from the subcontinent and claim to speak english do not understand you or prove able to articulate their thought in english  i m not try to upset anyone  but i m call it like i see it  this be a true story  i call the information number provide on the qatar foundation website to get some information on the american university you hear so much hype about  and be shunt through 4 different people who could not speak english  this be n t an obscure gvt office in the ministry of islamic study or whatever  this be qatar foundation   so  no  english be not a main language in qatar  and be mostly speak by the european and north american expat communities only  stay safe all  perfection do not exist  the question therefore  be  what level of imperfection be we willing to settle for  
hey guys  why do you forget phillipino  in qatar if you know malliyali and phillipino  no need to know anything else  on a serious note  english  with absolute ziltch grammer   hindi  not what we speak in india   urdu  malliyali and arabic to a great extent be common language here 
some company here prefer market executive speak malayalam and english only  qtel  qpost  trafic dept etc have their advertisement in arabic  malayalam  english and urdhu  i think hindi and urdu almost same but how many people here can read urdu  
good morning  unfortunately  this be a melting pot for different language tagalog  hindi  urdu  arabic and english please forgive any language i forget  now not wish to offend anyone but arabic and english be the main business language  however  indians have derive their onw english after the british left and even i have difficulty understand many of them  wen i go to a shope and there be and indian salesman i have to aske at least three time what he be say an this be meant seriously  there be other whose english be wonderful  most people in government position be well verse in english although i have to admit we there be a nuber of employee who speak very little english  you seem to have encounter the very few that do n t speak english  may i add this comment here  many more arabs speak english than english speaking race speak arabic  
qatar living lounge qatarization i have just be inform by my hr department that all secretarial  position now must be qatarized  can some one confirm this please  
i cant confirm  but i hope they wont qatarize cleaning job 
yes 
the low rung on the totem pole will get the high pay  visit www qatarhappening com 
do n t that hurt     oh sorry qatarized not catherterised  sorry my mistake   xx 
it could very well be true  qatarization be a very high priority here  but with that say  say that qataris should fill secretarial position and get them to do so be two different thing  a national be go to have to want the job before the job be qatarized  i m not sure how this would be handle so i do n t see it happen overnight  i m not sure if this refers to replace people already in position or for new position open up  one would like to think that expat will keep their job until their contract run out at least  also  it could be that a qualified qatari be give first opportunity at a new position and if it be n t fill then it can be open up to expat  in any event  it will take time to sort out  
 i can see it happen overnight indeed  in my organization we have four administrative position sit empty that have be reserve for qataris  no one want them  we have one woman for a while  but she quit after a month a her husband think that it be too far for her to drive  what silliness  we ca n t hire anyone to fill the position a they be reserve for qataris  but we ca n t find any qataris willing to take the job  and nothing be get do  why be administrative position consider to be   unskilled   anyway  a good admin assistant be worth their weight in gold   
light of the subject but think it be a valid point that gumby make  if there be people willing to do the job  myself include but the position be empty be reserve for qatari s it seem so pointless   please excuse me i be at the moment mesmerise by the above signature     lol 
me too  who be that  visit www qatarhappening com 
 the   pecking   order for job have always be qatari first  second be other arab and third be any other nationality  admin job  particularly hr  have always be see a an easy qatarisation option  it s not like an operational job where  if somebody screw up  there s often a big bang or an accident  hr and it system can slowly deteriorate with no apparent effect   until the system do collapse and by then it s often too late  enter the expat again to sort thing out  one comment  if the job have be vacant for so long  do you actually need the job   
i think it s me   oops my bad  i m not a blonde  lol lol lol 
visas and permits is there anyone here marry to a qatari  i be work b4 in qatar  i leave qatar last yr but be n t able to get noc from my company  my fiance be qatari but we re plan to get married outside qatar coz we do n t have the approval yet in qatar gov t  now  my problem be how be i goin to go back there with him  can he get me a family visa  thanks in advance  
dream 
why do he not move to your country  problem solve khallas  afterall you r marry him for love and not for come to qatar right  
me  no you cant unless you have approval you have to wait 1 year then he can sponsor you with his own visa  like company visa or kadama under his name so it easy for you to chance later if you get approval  
english only in the main forum  
even you get marry to any country to have to apply here  but make sure he be apply not only tell you or something you have to be wise my dear  he be marry  you will be he s second wife sorry to ask like this cuz this all count  and his family know about you  
uffff omg    hahahahah i dont know what to do to laugh or to cry   listen if u believe him that he will marry u i feel sorry for u  second thing why u leave the country and why he didnt help u to stay and solve ur problem about the noc  that mean he be not serious with u  today im not in a modd to fight so i deleted the rest of my comment  i will let her dream about marriage with a qatari ufff how can she believe him if he didnt even help her to stay in the country  a allah      
without government approval of your marriage  you wo n t get a family visa back into qatar  unfortunately  marrying you out of the country can cause major problem for your fiance  so i would suggest you wait until your marriage be approve  the only other option be that you relocate somewhere else  marry there  but your marriage will not be valid in qatar  and you will have no claim to any inheritences if god forbid  something should happen to him  does your fiance not have some wasta  that can obtain your release from your company  i be not say that will make thing any easy  since you still need to have the govt approval for marriage  but at least you can be in qatar  near him  
fil im sure she be just naiv  for sure he be married and his family will accept her   never believe me their pride be number 1  ufff i wish girl dont trust them so easily and dont beleieve them everything bhut what to do  
xena  maybe he not a true qatari only he be bear here like a lot of others that claim to be qataris  plus there be other issue will his family ever accept you the answer probably be no  
im sorry mr amyooo not all the same    they can get marry why not  im filipina marry to qatari for so many year i have approval my kid be qataries  if god will permit  no one can stop  and so many qataries be marry to filipina  sorry to tell you  
politics un move to protect gay  transgender in a late move  the united nations continue it march to further add homosexuality and transgender to it list of human right  is the un go too far  and what do this mean for country that condemn these thing a unacceptable to their culture  will the un of the future start put such nation on it pariah list  http  www chicagonow com trans girl cross 2012 11 united nations protect transgender  
i wish the un would show the same concern for all the child be murder in gaza  
mn  but a for now un s main concern and priority be to protect gayz  transgenders    
 france be allow   mosque for gay    so it s only a matter of time before it use it security council seat to push for this elsewhere  it s a brave new world  http  www albawaba com editorchoice france mosque gay 452009  
good on the un  nobody deserve to be persecute  
would openly list country where homosexuality be outlaw to be a vagabond nation  the matter of homosexuality be by far a much dispute affair among people of various religion  creed and race  that to simply state it s right and all those who condemn it for any reason be wrong  will not be as simple  that say if they wish to protect those who be gay and transgenders from oppression and mistreatment then i suppose they have all the liberty to do so  however yes they should also then open their eye to all the oppression commit around the world at large  and work towards stamp them out  and not just pick and choose to their convenience which have clearly be the case with un in the recent time  which have cause people around the globe to hold them in contempt for  and not take them seriously  
yes  the un for push for equality and freedom  should it put non compliant nation on a pariah list  no  
 does the un have a pariah list that they add country s who commit human right violation to  or will they just add   persecution of homosexual and transgenders   to their report on various country   
marco but what about the gay and transgenered arab in gaza  who will speak for them  
of course they must have the same right a all other people  after all  they be human and they be people  what difference do their sexuality make  they be still human  
i agree fatimah  but if the un say homosexuality be a human right  then they ll list country that persecute gay right along those that deny press freedom and get involve with human trafficking  etc  qdclover  there be no gay in gaza  
is it illegal to bring liqour to qatar  one of my friend be come to qatar for the first time on a work visa  he buy 2 bottle of liqour from bahrain duty free shop  but when he reach doha airport it be take away by the custom people  is it illegal to bring it from duty free    and also i want to know  whether there will be some problem for him to get his rp  pls  your view

u could buy liquor carry choc from qatar  then who could have problem in take it out to us  what a question  
should n t be a problem  except if it get warm on the tarmac your chocolate will melt inside your bag  mandi 
why cant you take it from airport duty free  
you may only buy such thing in the duty free upon departure  transporting alcohol in this manner be illegal  
technically you should n t  but no one will check your outgoing baggage  it s only what you bring in to the country that anyone care about  
you can carry alcohol chocolate  not a problem  in check in luggage  i purchase some form the dubai duty free  bring them to doha and carry them to the us  
thank you very much  everyone  for your reply  i appreciate the information that you all have provide  
they will not be check if the chocolate you carry be with or without alcohol  
from what i know  you ca n t bring any foreign food into the us  but i may be wrong  although i have see many people who have their food take away by custom in the us  well check to make sure  
no clue  i doubt there be any check at the airport  that airport be in such a messy condition anyhow  slow check in  long line at passport control  full departure hall  people sit on the floor  filthy toilet      
qatar living lounge drinking in qatar  i want to know what the law be about drink there  is there a licence that allow you to drink a certain amount etc   what about contractor for company over there  is there a certain limit to drink etc  any info that be real please let me know  thanks 
yes you can drink in hotel bar or get a liqour license and you have a ration per month depend on your salary 
licenses be for purchase alcohol from qatar distribution company  to get it you require salary certificate from your company with the follow detail  1  basic salary  min 4500   2  wether company provide accomodation else mention allowance detail  thats all it take religion doesnt matter    
so say that you get a license do that mean you can drink at any bar  what be the normal limit for a contractor  
a license to purchase alcohol mean you buy booze from qdc and drink in your house  you dont need a license to drink in a bar  
and for your information religion do matter  no muslims be give alcohol permit  
depends on how much the contractor can drink    
if a contractor get a license and decide to drink at a bar they can go to any bar  
smoke   paleezz dont rub that bull shit here  i be one and i have my license why bother  why dont you call qdc urself to find out  
i didnt know they suddenly change the rule for muslim to buy booze  
well i do n t know what qdc be  also i be ask because all i know be i be tell that you have to get a license to drink  
qatari culture i m visit friend in qatar soon  be it ok to bring packed bacon into qatar  q238 
 no  it be illegal  people sometimes   sneak   it in but out of respect for the law  i would n t do it   
you can get in big trouble a pork be ban in qatar  the same for alcohol  after you collect your luggage at the airport  you have to pass it through a scan  i recommend you do n t bring any pork or alcohol with you  they wo n t even allow the one you buy at the duty free shop before your flight  
lol  seriously do n t bring pork here 
if you re ask for trouble  by all mean do so  but dont say we do n t warn you  
i must confess that people have bring pork into qatar by strap it on their inner clothes  some people even have bring in in baggage  it be just your luck  if you get through  
 if you be visit   friend   here in qatar then you should have ask them  if ever you do and they say   yes   then i doubt they be indeed your friend  if they say   no   and you still ask here in ql then you definitely do n t believe and trust your friend  for whatever the risk  do n t bring in pork and other product with pork  qatar be a muslim country and for u muslim pork be haram   
it be not unknown for people to bring in the odd kilo or five include ham  pate  bacon  lincolnshire sausage etc however due to the ongoing swine flu thingo i would n t think it would be the most opportune moment to do so  
no dont just risk your life  it not nice to do illegal things its not legal over here 
you can sneak it in between brick of cocaine  that way the dog ca n t smell the bacon  just make sure your visit  be schedule for the next 20  year  
i come back from europe last week with 2  kilo in my checked bag  a do at least a dozen others on the same flight  alcohol will be confiscate  no doubt about it  but the pork seem to be wink at a it go through the scanner  i ve never hear of anyone be detain or arrest for bring either into the country  the alcohol be simply confiscate and they be warn not to try and bring it again  nationality and ethnicity may play a role here  i m a white western middleaged female  asian and other people of colour may have a different experience and perhaps someone can speak to that point  many westerners here travel to uae or bahrain and bring back pork with no incident  in my 2  year here   
qatar living lounge  ca n t ask what s   illegal   in qatar  what the hell  i ask what s the situation with marijuana in qatar meaning like what be the law  be it common  etc  and my question get delete because it s illegal i guess  that s so dumb because what if you want to know the law there  and what if what ever your asking be illegal in qatar  you could risk go to jail because you be n t inform of this   
come on big guy  you should know the answer  drug and booze among other thing be illegal in this country  
here be a zero tolerance policy towards drug and penalty for drug trafficking include the death penalty or life in jail  penalties for possession or use of illegal drug include imprisonment and heavy fine  qatar have issue a warning to visitor to be aware of it strict law against illegal drug possession  the presence of illegal drug detect in blood or urine test be consider possession  you may also be charge with possess drug if trace amount be find on your body  clothing or luggage  amounts of 0 05 gram or less can lead to guilty verdict  medication available over the counter or by prescription in your country may be illegal or consider a controlled substance in the qatar   
wait for another 1 month plzz  i can answer u ur question   
i know i need specific though  because i smoke marijuana regularly in the us  i want to know the specific laws please  thank you  
 dracula  so how would the country qatar ever figure out i m in possession of marijuana  bloodstream wise   because they do n t drug test you in the airport or something or at school  be i correct  
   blood test   when you re get the rp  resident permit    
 dracula  do every citizen of qatar need to get a blood test before they actually become a citizen  
 yes u hav to hav some blood test before get rp but that does nt include a test for illegal drug  so no way they can catch u unless u hav it in ur bag  which they do check regularly  lolz  and stop dream become a   citizen   of qatar  well remain an   expat    
that you be not really from the us  it be very apparent that you smoke cannabis all the time your friggin  brain be go  it be not just a qatari law it be an islamic law also  put your doobie down for a few minute and do some research on google  i do n t think we need to do anything in the name of god  he s a big boy and can take of himself  
drop the leaf for a month before you come here  drink lot of water to cleanse your system  you ll be fine  you wo n t find any around here  you can forget about it  whatever you do  do not attempt to bring any in here  the custom will figure you out and you ll be in the house of pain  you wo n t be able to score a beer either unless you steal from your folk  if this doesn  t sound too entice  a i m sure it do n t  try the well proven begging screaming to stay back home with your grandparent or something  
family life in qatar why in qatar they be issue liquor license even to muslim people  q238 
because few muslim consume liquor more than other religion people

why do n t u mind ur fxxx business 
try to mind ur own business in a country you make ur living from     
a muslim will not get liquor license in his name  they can get it for a company register in their name

hey  just fyi  it be illegal to ask your friend to buy alcohol for you  
at the end of the day the end justify the mean and after 20 beer who care what you be drink anyway 
never heard or saw a rule to say that buy a gift for a friend be illegal  selling alcohol on to other people after you have purchase be illegal though  sharing a beer with a buddy be just good manner    
if what i have understand  the alcohol be allow to travel from qdc to only the purchaser premise and shouldnt leave the say premise thereafter  sharing it with anybody at the say premise be not illegal but carry it to some other place or it be carry elsewhere when give a a gift seem be n t allow  i would love to be tell it be otherwise    
 yes  with a qdc license  purchase and then take directly home be the only thing allow  if you go to your friend s home when your thirsty  maybe that be ok   dunno i do n t think anyone can buy  legally  and take to someone else s home and   leave it there    seems like someone will think this be break the rule   
are there any beer that azamat miss

welcome to qatar can a lady get liquor license  quick question  can a lady who be under her father sponsorship get a liquor license  she be work and meet the salary requirement and not muslim  any clue anyone  if yes what be the procedure  same a men  if no then have a good day visit again   lol 
i have the same question but a wife under husband s sponcership in this case 
are your own quota not enough  
women can get them but i do not know if they must have their residency permit first  they just need to go to the proper agency  i believe the fee be  1  000 qr  
according to the license department  if the girl be live in her father s home  with her family she ca n t get one  if she have her own appatment even under the sponsorship she would be able to  charan  same go for your wife a i think she be still live in you home  but perhaps you can ask one of the many lady follower  lol lol  
everbdy can get a liqor permit evn muslim too  coz i have see some muslim hold liqor permit  the only thing your require be a noc statin your salary and entitlement from your employer sponsorer  and accorrding to your entitlement the ministry will decide how much quota weekly be permit to you  i e if your entitlement show that your accomodation be provide by company u ll be permit for big unit and if you own a car with trnsportation allowance the unit will increase and if your jst state ur salary without acco  and allowance the unit will decrease  
does anyone know the allowance for each wage band  
the husband or wife of someone with a license can get a license for themselves  the allowance be share between the two of them  
a lady can be get liquor permit as long a she be sponsor by a company and not husband sponsord a only one member of a family be allow to have  
i be also sponsor by my dad and i go to qdc last week to apply  they check my company letter and salary detail  they say that as long a my basic be at least 4000 riyal  i be eligible for a license  the only conditon be that the rp  id card should be valid at the time of application  i get my license instantly and my company plan to change my sponsorship around 1st november  thats when i complete my probation period   also your allowance would be equal to 10  of your salary  hope this help  
telljax  i want to get a license too so that i can quit bug my dad but thing be i do n t want my visa to be transfer under any company just yet  i enjoy go in and out of qatar and not have to request for letter and permit  can i still get a liquor license  
qatar living lounge liquor permit hi we arrive in doha ten day ago  we will not have our residency visa for at least another 45 day  is there any way to get a permit to buy liquor for your own home use in the meantime  or  is there anyone who could purchase some for u  thanks scot 
alcohol consumption in doha make me cry  oops  sorry channel bbskiu for a second there  no you ca n t get a liscense till you get your residency  and i would look to your co worker rather than ask someone on an internet site to do something illegal for you    
there be plenty of alcohol in qatar  if you ca n t wait to get your residency just hit one of the bar at the hotel  
no it be n t  if it be  please send the cop to arrest me  
why do n t someone do something about it  very sad  
alcohol be good  porkchops be good  bacon be good  yum yum 
this be what i get for get drunk so early in the day   p 
drink wisely and occosionaly  but ask somebody in internet to buy some alcohol for you i think be not appropriate  please go to hotel or bar around for now until you have your own liquor license  
i do not recommend drink for anyone  instead of drink khamr in qatar  we could drink camel milk  maybe zamzam water  rise water drink  mint tea  
a lot of qataris do not use english  they do not know about what expatriates do here  
i do  makes you forget you live in doha  
qatar living lounge drinking in qatar  i want to know what the law be about drink there  is there a licence that allow you to drink a certain amount etc   what about contractor for company over there  is there a certain limit to drink etc  any info that be real please let me know  thanks 
yes you can drink in hotel bar or get a liqour license and you have a ration per month depend on your salary 
licenses be for purchase alcohol from qatar distribution company  to get it you require salary certificate from your company with the follow detail  1  basic salary  min 4500   2  wether company provide accomodation else mention allowance detail  thats all it take religion doesnt matter    
so say that you get a license do that mean you can drink at any bar  what be the normal limit for a contractor  
a license to purchase alcohol mean you buy booze from qdc and drink in your house  you dont need a license to drink in a bar  
and for your information religion do matter  no muslims be give alcohol permit  
depends on how much the contractor can drink    
if a contractor get a license and decide to drink at a bar they can go to any bar  
smoke   paleezz dont rub that bull shit here  i be one and i have my license why bother  why dont you call qdc urself to find out  
i didnt know they suddenly change the rule for muslim to buy booze  
well i do n t know what qdc be  also i be ask because all i know be i be tell that you have to get a license to drink  
doha shopping where be the wine  liquor shop  hi  newbie here in doha  i be old that with a resident permit  one can obtain alcoholic drink in a distributor shop in doha  will appreiate anyone to let me know where exactly be the ditributor shop for alcoholic drink  and what be the amount one can get  thanks a million  regards  
in islam  it be not allow to muslims to drink alcohol  i beg you please do n t support alcohol sale in qatar  we be very sad because alcohol could be consume in a muslim country        environment could shape your behavior too  
cant help with the location but my husband be about to get his alcohol permit  if you do not know already you will need an application form  a specific letter from you employer allow you to have alcohol  copy of rp and i think photo  and qr1000 deposit  
well  i be afraid the one who own the bulk store be a muslim    
i quite understand that a a muslim you be against alcohol consumption  for sure  alcohol abuse have wreck many life and be a grow problem around the world  what i do n t inderstand be why you be against non muslim drink alcohol in a sensible moderate way  is it because you believe that alcohol may be too much of a temptaion to muslims  do tell me  i be very curious to know your reason  
place be a bit tough to find at first but it be near al jazeera academy  they use to have a website but it disappear  the number be 4687547 and 4699412  hour for the shop be sit  thurs 10 30 be to 7 30 pm and for the permit office they be sun  thurs 8 be to 7 30 and sit 10 30 be to 7 30  how much you can buy per month be dependent on your salary  you must have a letter from your sponsor to get permit  very nice shop  good selection  
 the muslim who sell alcohol for non muslims do a sinful act for sell alcohol  i should double check for that  i think that  might be require too  all people who be in a   muslim   land be encourage to behave accord to islamic law   
hi  thanks for your kind info  that be great  i be surprise that some people be voice against selling  buying alcoholic drink  well  it be one who can control and at the same time to enjoy the taste to decide  thanks indeed  fredie 
hi  thanks to all of you guy  well  who know the art of drink shall enjoy it and control it to one s ability  besides  30 50 ml of alcohol per day be good for prevent cardia attack  well proven fact  well  i am going to find out who owns the store    thanks again  fredie 
the qdc or qatar distribution centre be locate off the whole sale market road  if you turn south of salwa on the whosale market road and follow it up to the qatar technical school turn right on the road in front of the school and follow the road or the traffic  you will get to a gate  if there be room to get in you will have to go first to the permit office with a letter from your sponsor  your i d  card  a fill in form and a 1000 qrs  
as for drink alcohol in qatar  it be not neccessary but it help  when i see the uptight driver with a severe case of anger  i think maybe less coffee and more alcohol would result in people with less anger and more patience  
doha shopping  people outside of qdc qlers  have you see some people outside of qdc  well  last thrusday when i be park there for buy my boost  a couple of guy  with a strong and recognizable accent  come to me and ask me for buy 4 bottle of whisky for them  and they would give me 500 qr for the   favor   on top of the bill  watch out  do n t do that  keep on mind you be responsible for the liquor purshased in qdc  pay attention to stranger outside qdc  cheers  
for buy boost  why do u go to qdc  its available at any supermarket like indian supermarket  ffc or lulu     
thanks for the warning  i have the same problem  rizks offer my 200qr and free papadoms for a month   o  
just make sure they be not undercover cop  i ve hear of that happen in the past  
disgraceful  they should apply for a lience like everyone else and then they can buy as much a they want of the amber nectar  
they would qdc if the company give them a noc for liquor permit  
they must be the guy who want to buy a drink but cant get their hand on a permit to buy some of this drink a their company wont give them a permit 
well they can always brew their own  or trip on other substance   
be there any other way to get a liquor permit without the basic salary of 4000qrs    
just ask    
i know a few people who sell liquor away from qdc  high risk  
qatar living lounge al khor  food and drink hi  which of the club in al khor serve alcohol  or where can i get a drink of nice cold beer in al khor  except at home  
benson  reason i be ask be my friend live in al khor for almost 2 week  he claim that the club do not serve alcohol  like the waha club and so on  be that true  i be come to visit him over christmas and i be sure he be wrong wrong  he be also yet to get his resident permit  will the supermarket serve him a few can of beer or not  
dude  it be a muslim country  i doubt beer be available anywhere outside hotel club and a government run outlet  your dream if you think you can get beer in a supermarket  
you need a liqor permit  and then you can buy at a place call qdc  manage by qatar airways   from there you be allow to bring the stuff to your home and get drunk  alternatively you can go to a five star hotel bar and pay 50 or more riyals for one lousy can of heineken  
i live in a couple of muslim country where beer be freely and not so freely available  just think this might be one of them  
and since it s a muslim country  your permit be limit to approximately 40  of your salary per month  
so you reckon smuggle in a bottle of vodka or two and a pork joint for my mate xmas dinner be a no no then  
and  yeah  you need an noc  no objection  from your sponsor to apply for the permit  
universal  the custom officer will be glad to get some pork and vodka for christmas  
 the al waha club be a recreation facility within the al khor community gate mean it serve people work in rasgas and qatargas  such club inside this kind of facility do not serve alcohol  there be no beer sell in supermarket or convenience store  as say above only those with a qdc liquor permit will be able to get some booze and drink it   at home    if you still want to go   a club   and get a few drink then you  and your friend friends  will have to drive to doha  regards    
lp shld be serve for free he often get on a roll after get drunk   
lifestyle in doha hi  can you please give u some background regard doha s lifestyle  in term of cost of living and quality of education  i m a nurse by profession  be there many career oppotunities for me as well  we have plan in join my husband in doha with my 8 y o  son  what s your advice  thanks  
qatar living lounge lifestyle i have be offer job  both in dubai and in doha  i will be visit in sept to look at both place and form an opinion for myself i get the impression the lifestyle be well in qatar  le traffic  easy to move around etc  accomadation be cheap in dubai  can you give me your pro s and con on both place  appreciate jr 
 qatar be less developed than dubai but it s on the rise and will be a large construction site for the next decade  accommodation be just as expensive in dubai if not a little more  qatar be a less hectic place than dubai  if you do a search   qatar dubai   on this forum you can get an idea of what have be say in the past   
 let me give you a skewed perspective on this doha vs dubai debate though you can search around and find out  salaries and expense may be similar  add 3 hours every day in traffic waste on dubai road to half an hour in doha  in dubai you would   see   load of party oppurtunities and fantastic night life  the operative word be see  but your employer will load you with enough work that you would only have a thursday  now friday dubai have change to friday saturday weekend like doha  night to get wild if you stretch yourself and try it regularly workplace and health will take a quick toll on you   in doha you would   have   load of time to party  but you wont   see   much oppurtunities other than a couple of jaded   let get on with it   type    the only excitment i get from these party be the one that i generate myself   type gathering  loads of forum discussion be definite pointer  if you be come to the gulf with a family in tow  and your family prefers quite    
nice comparison tg  do u have an idea a to if one have to go to dubai from qatar  wat ar the visa requirments and wat will be the cost of say emirate economy ticket and wat will be the cheap airline to go to dubai thank you in advance  
thanks for highlight the life style in qatar  could you suggest some good place to live  preferable a semifurnished accomodation with reasonalble rent in qatar which be close to grand hamad avenue 
close to grand hamad avenue with a reasonable rent  
i mean to say that if your work place be grand hamad street which be the best locality to reside 
reasonable rent do not happen in qatar anymore i would get a job where they provide the acommodation if i be you  
its fine but even to opt for that one must have the idea of locality  so which one of those happens to be a place for decent living and near to grand hamad avenue 
jimroddy  if u want to ask about dubai go to britishexpats com middle east section  lot of guy work in dubai there  agree that if u could you should get a job with accommodation  house price in doha go crazy at the moment  
the only thing grand about that area be the grand hamad avenue or else it better to stay away a far from there  if you be keen to have a house in that area make sure you have dedicate parking in the compound or building  
family life in qatar doha v abu dhabi i know this may be a biased question in a qatar forum  but honestly  what s your advice for someone have 2 quasi similar offer  one in doha and 1 in abu dhabi  and of course mutually exclusive    
horses for course  abu dhabi and qatar be similar  abu dhabi be a lot more congested and try to move towards be on par with dubai  probably more social outlet  thing to do in abu dhabi and surround area  
are roads similar in abu dhabi  qatar  there be no ring road  dono  work in abu dhabi  but please pay a visit to u  in qatar  
any one who compare the two city prove he hasnt be to one of them  as someone who just come back from uae last week  doha be not even close to what abu dhabi be right now  no contest  ad have much much much more social night life  infrastructure be generation ahead  the road in abu dhabi be second to none  traffic be well take care of and life in general be much well  women be way way way nicer and much more social as well  build quality of the house be far ahead of what be available in doha and the city be much clean  greener and about a million time well organize  as for road  ill put it this way  i be at the officer club in abu dhabi late for my flight  so i tell my taxi driver  mercedes e class wagon  to plz hurry to the airport  he be drive at 200 220kph only slow down to 140kph for the camera  and drive at that speed for a good 10 min  and have me at my destination well before time  roads in abu dhabi be amazing  abu dhabi be the rich city in the   
it s a green city  there be everything and they have more vision than here   
abu dhabi rule  doha be nothing and never will get close to what abu dhabi be  better life  good people  friendly environment  good local   trust me doha need to educate all people how to treat people  abu dhabi do not have noc system u can change job once u complete one year doha you get a 2 year ban even if your with a company with 20 year and they refuse your release qatar be prison my friend you come here and thats the end of your life in the middle east  hope this help dont make the wrong choice that i do comming to this shit hole 
http  dohanews co post 13628725222 
tsk tsk tsk  
i have be to abu dhabi for 2 year and now in doha since last 2 year  as everyone say ad will be surely good choice for you  
i have live in both place and there be no comparison  abu dhabi be 5 10 year ahead and the gap be only widen  better road infrastructure  no exit permit system  easy lifestyle  concert at yas island  etc  
you obviously have n t live in abu dhabi itself  parking be chronic and parked vehicle often damage  we do over two year there and there be time when we return late and the near parking spot be almost a taxi ride away  it have get more to do than qatar in particular the club be outstanding  
moving to qatar doha v jeddah does anyone prefer one over the other and why  thanks  
be i go to compar doha with jeddah yea talk about riyadh then we can talk like alexa who be once upon a time resident of riyadh and be dream of have a dream house in riyad  d in life style freedom doha be alt more good than jeddah i have be to jeddah about 8 time in 8 year it all the same yea few construction might have take place but i think you will live with ppl and drive on road so 
i love riyadh  great social life  jeddah be nice too  a strange mix of old and new  amazing diversity  much cheap than doha  if you be muslim  than what more can you ask for than have makkah and medina within easy reach  jeddah be also closer to jordan  however  qatar be a lot more open and freer  but i find it more boring  you can travel out a and when you want  it si very peaceful and people can visit you more easily  the choice be yours  
thank you both  britexpat  why do you think doha be more boring  
doha be much small  less of everything  rstaurants be expensive  one other thing be that qataris be far more easy go than saudis  
thanks  
 i visit all the gulf contry  i live 2 year in ryadh and i really felt home i love and miss everything there  poeple be kind  frindly  and helpfull and food be really good eccept   hayat el amr bel marouf   jeddah be a nice place too  true qatar be the most boring place but it s a very safe contry   
jeddah without a doubt  qatar be all hype and no substance  besides in jeddah you have access to the sea where a here you go to the corniche and just look at it  i would n t be surprise if they start tax for that soon  
 qatar be a nice place though boring  i miss jeddah so much specially their   haraj      corniche    during ramadan some people from russia and turkey be sell their good in a cheap price   
so jeddah be actually more fun than doha   i really think it would be doha bc they do have club and bar and potential concert  all which arent allow  or in the open in saudi   
doha be good than saudi  a woman do not have dress restriction  you can buy liquor  there be party  and religous workships for other religion  so it more liberal than saudi

it all depend on your nationality  if you be western passport holder  the salary be peanut and you will not be able to survive  however  if you be a national of an asian or an african country  it be a good salary and in all the above a b c situation that you have mention  you should be able to save some money  
it be good for a single  grab it  
good for single only  
mohd  are these option focus on a single bread winner  or  in fact you have not consider two major section of the society  d  family who fall under the  3 5  kid  bracket e  dink couple  double income no kids  
if you be single it s okay but if you have a family this be small  unlike expats from europe or america  they be receive atleast 40 50k minimum a month  
it be depend upon your profession and experience  if you will not get such kind of salary anywhere presently it be good for you  rest be your choice 
it depend on your nationality  qualification  experience  your offer position status in a company  
you will end up pay 8500 per month for a good 2bhk family accommodation in musheireb  bin mahmood or al saad  for single you can share a flat with someone  2000 per month  it really depend upon what be you get presently in your current company and then add up the additional expense for the high cost of living here  
if i have that kind of salary i d be a king in my country  lol  
it be good  even with family also   
doha shopping make up  hello everyone  i have recently move to doha  i be base in the uae before and whenever i want to buy cosmetic  make up  i would go to specific small shop to get them  the reason behind this be the price would be about 30  less than the perfume in fancy store at mall  and yes  the product be absolutely genuine  sme brans i buy be estee lauder  loreal  bobbi brown  so  be there such shop in doha too  if yes  please give me their location  thank you  
sister go to souq market nearby fanar  
try lifestyle in centerpoint   
yesterday you be ask about brand perfumes  today it be make up and for your information brand cosmetic like estee lauder  bobbi brown  lancome etc  be not sell in small shop or in the souqs  if you be look for a mass brand like rimmel  bourjois etc  you can get it from lulu hypermarket  if you be look for branded item you must pay the full price in the showroom like faces  salam  4u  pari gallery  51 east  sephora etc  could you please tell me which shop in uae be sell those brand you mention at 30  cheap  
boxbe  lifestyle in centre point be not sell premium brand cosmetic and they be follow the price of the distributor  
cherukkan be right  you will not get brand cosmetic at discount rate here except during the sale at retailer 
to pay even 30   there r many home tip   
in souk area there be one shop who sell in whole sale price  hameed something name  check there   
boxbe  hameed hamad be sell branded perfumes at cheap price but they be not sell cosmetic  i suggest that shop to op for branded perfumes  
if they be sell in dodgy little shop at low price  then they be fake or very old  if you want quality  you have to pay the price  
nomerci  branded cosmetic  genuine  be not sell in any such small shop in dubai and if so it could be a fake or counterfeit product a mention by you  i know the distributor in uae and the suppliers of all those brands have get offices in dubai so there be no question of such item be sell in small shop  they be available only in the major shopping mall of uae  all of them really care the image  
welcome to qatar calling all filipinos  help  hi guy  just want to have an idea on how to live there in qatar  im from philippines and ill be assign there in new doha intl  airport a a site technician  with offer of 3400qr  600qr  allowance  be it enough for me  my co worker say that 600 be good enough for every month  hope you can help me out for the cost of live there  il be there on or before sept1 2011  guy pls help me  give me insight guy on how to survive there  
the cost of living here be quite high  but whether your salary be enough would mainly depend on your lifestyle  other factor  such a whether your company would provide you with accommodation and transportation would be very important a well  if you have to pay your accommodation  from your own pocket  then i m afraid your salary would not be enough  
you will be provide with free accommodation and transportation  these thing cost a lot here in doha  600 allowance  i think it s enough if you will prepare your own food  cost of living in doha nowadays be very high and i prefer to make it 1  000  food  personal item   
 does your contract provide free accommodation  transportation  food plane fare etc   these be important factor for u to give you a good advise  also  there be a lot of post in   cost of living   in doha which you can enter and search in the above box  which can help you decide good  
yes  they be right  600 allowance be not clear  be it accomodation housing allowance  food allowance  transpo  if this be for housing  it not enough i believe the 600 allowance you mention be for food because usually here  employer provide transpo and housing  
if ree accomodation and transportation and the 600 be food allowance and you will cook your own food it two much enough for you 
if it free transpo and accomodation  accept it  well than nothing   
you can survive with that package  a a 1st timer  just live a simple life and stay away from bad things good luck   
if they ll provide you with free accomodation and transpo  and you do n t have a big family to support back in the philippines then that offer be good enough  
no worry kabayan accept and enjoy it  
take the offer  you re lucky that you have that offer for a site technician  some filipino technician be get much low offer yet they be accept it  i agree with fellow qls  it may depend on your lifestyle  good luck and welcome to qatar

i like doha well then dubai  because be more quiet city and i get everything i need here  i have wonderful life back home  i have my family  friend and place to hangout enjoy  but once i settle here  all change but good changed  it just different and i somehow can appreciate the differences

it quiet  but you can find thing to do if you really want to  now being happy will depend on a lot of thing  to be honest  are you single do you have a very active night life  etc  i do n t have a curfew i think that might depend upon what job you have and the requirement  active night life there be one but it limited  i see you be from the uk will be honest with you and say it nothing like the pub scene back there  clubs and pub be locate only in hotel  easy to get around if you drive but you have to be aggressive in your driving manner and defensive    i just like it here  for many many reason  but you do need to look at all the perspective before come here  one main one be that the riyal be peg to the dollar not the english pound  
i be here because my husband  he be my sponsor  i have work but i dont change my sponsorship  i can leave the company anytime i want and leave the country anytime i want  i have friend around keep me busy  i have solon to pamper my self  i go to nice restaurant when i miss home  i go to club when i want dance  i can find all i need here in doha  dubai be nice and big city then doha  sure the malls there get more to offer but so much traffic just to go one place to another  doha be well in my opinion for living  dubai only for shopping  
i would n t say i enjoy live in doha  but right now i do n t hate it either  let s say i m ok with it  because i know it s only a few more month                                   http  www freewebs com qatarpets

why ask only the lady  i would rather have one rise and a kind word from a friend while i m here than a whole truck load when i m go 
either that or i m pretty simple lol i think i ll take positive attitude   actually  i m easily entertained and do n t believe in get bore because there s always something to do might not be what you have in mind tho  but look at the star on a clear night  go out with friend for coffee and laugh until you get silly  ok do n t take long   simple pleasures  i enjoy your sense of humor bc  you re a bit off the wall    
be always busy look at women   just kid hon

have patience  mod have not delete your other question here be the link  http  www qatarliving com answers computers and internet can anyone solve this problem 
all you have to do be activate your software online if you be use a genuine software  and if not  buy a legal one  
you be use a pirated copy of the operating system and that be why you be get this pop up  which os be you use  first of all you should not use a pirated copy and a you be already use it you should have inactivate the genuine windows validation earlier  now i think you can stop the pop up with a software but the screen will be black with a watermark  not a genuine windows  
just my friend have reformated my laptop and instal new os windows 7 ultimate  maybe it not genuine but do you think be there any other way not reformating again or by not buy  just to remove this  
just buy a legal one and do n t ask for any illegal option to correct your problem here in ql  piracy and copyright infringement be punishable by law  
as i mention in my previos post you can stop it but the blue screen of windows 7 will change to grey black with a watermark  you should either re install a genuine copy or do a re installation and inactivate the wgv with the software which you may find in the internet  
that would be good  need to check the price on this first  
moving to qatar please  someone who truly know the answer  do i really need a no objection letter  i be buy a used car from a private individual for which i be pay cash  i have do a search and be not quite find the information i be look for  do i need a letter of no objection to do the transfer  i need an answer from someone who really know for sure  not someone who be just guess  
no objection letter require only in that case  if you wish to buy the car on your s company name i e if the company be go to give you cash to go and buy the car on your own choice but under company s name  but if you be buy car for your personal use  only for your home and for other transporations purpose  no need any kind of letter  just go to traffic department with the owner of car  fill the form  submit your copy of i d and insurance  
you d need an noc  no objection certificate  if your company be not a government firm  secondly  you would not need an noc if you re here in qatar on your husband s sponsorship  you d need an noc if your company sponsor your visa even if you re married and you stay with your husband in qatar  hope this help  
nadarojan  you re wrong about what you say  i have to present company letter both the time when i buy my first car in may 2008 and second car in december 2008  my visa be sponsor by al mana  my colleague who work for ashghal  public works authority  which be a semi govt  firm do n t have to submit noc  
if you be an expatriate in qatar  wish to own a lmv  car suv upto size of a small van  you would need a no objection  aka arabic letter  letter address to the traffic department from your sponsor  this be one of the document that should be present for transfer the ownership of the vehicle  
ladyjane  you good check with your company s hr dept  who deal with visa sponsorship  they d give you accurate idea about where they stand on this issue  check with employee of your company  your colleague  
leatherface  et al  i do ask my employer  and i still could n t get a straight answer  i be happy to see the 1st response to my question then the water get all muddy  again  with the 2nd response  c mon  who know for sure what the answer be  
well short  simple  you need to have no objection letter from your sponsor if u want to buy a car   new or used one   100  valid information  
leatherface  no i be not  because i dont care where you work what you have do in your case  but if you be say like this  i also have proove with me  one of my friend s sister who be work in one of private company and off course under it sponsorship  she get the car and change the ownership of the car with out no objection letter  and this all process do by my self and her brother  first day we go and ask for the requirement and they say no need  and we have do this process in two day  yes it quite possible may be at the time ownership  they be look to company s name  may be from some company they need this  
for buying any car you need noc from your sponcer  
i agree with leatherface  the rule be like that  if u r sponsor be a company other than govt  you need noc for buy car   i submit noc for my car  
visas and permits can some body answer my question please  i be work in doha for last five year  this be my 02nd sponsor  i be work with him for last three year  can i get release from him a i get a good offer in qp  
why do n t you ask your sponsor  
a a normal case you should get it but even it s depends on his mind wish u all the best 
i need to make sure regard the law in qatar before ask him  my friend 
the law be that he do not have to give you an noc  
the law say your sponser have to be agree  it not you full right to get the releas  try to talk to him   
kindly request your current sponsor and make him understand the situation 
if your boss agree yes 
as you tell it be your 2nd sponsor  it mean you transfor your old visa to the new sponsor  so i think he dont have any problem to give you release bcoz he did nt buy your visa  he hire you localy  but even though everything be in his hand  most of the company be not give release  bcoz they buy visa and if they release it mean they be give visa  but in your case you just transfor your visa to the new company  so i think if you request him when he be in good mood  i hope he ll deal you good  inshaallah best of luck 
did you understand   you be a slave  your master tell you if he let you go or not  get it in your head  y o u h a v e n o r i g h t s i n q a t a r  
hi friend  it tottally defend on your current sponcers hand  if agree only you can get release from him or else no way okie  wish you best of luck you can try with him while he his in the good mood

advice and help please help me answer this  if you be on a plane go the speed of sound and walk from the back of the plane to the front  would you be walk faster than the speed of sound  
answer not find 
no  it be impossible that a simple walk be faster than the speed of a sound  
 even you sit idle inside the plane  it can be consider like   move   to the speed of sound  hence   walking   wont change any much   
yes your speed will be great than the speed of the plane  it will be the speed of sound plus your speed walking towards the front  
no 
the speed relative to a body in earth will be the speed of plane  walk speed 
to prove yourself right  go to top of plane in air and then walk  
if you walk on a plane while be move as fast a speed of light than the time on a plane be slow than the time on earth and even you walk inside of plan while it s in speed of light your speed will remain same a the plain b cuz of gravitational force it create inside of the plane wont allow you to walk or run more than the plan speed even in that speed your clock will start to work slow than the earth time so technically you be travel to the future faster with the help of speed  
a few of above answer be right  this be all about reference point  in case you be consider observation from a stationery point outside to that plane then answer be yes a relative speed concept of physics say that the speed will be speed of plane  your speed in same direction  
be careful of speed radar   you be fast than the plane

qatar living lounge need a serious reply on this   can a foreigner obtain a firearm license in qatar  i know most of you must ask why would i need a license in qatar  but that s all together a different argument  please answer only if you have understand about arm and ammunition law of qatar

i be die of curiosity  to know why you need a gun here in qatar  
well i think i know why the op wants a firearm  it could be relate to the news that the citizen of uae can buy weapon   
agree  i for one do now wish for anyone  except police and military personnel  to have gun  so please do not ask and do n t ever think of own a gun here  if you want  buy gun in your home country and use it there anytime you want  
 try to live with buy a white landcruiser  it be a good killing machine for beginner  then  you need to get a no objection letter from your sponsor state that he have no objection on register you a   007   then mr ban ki moon can certify that your fire arm will be use only for peaceful  scientific matter then the fire brigade will issue you a lisence for arm that do not ignite fire then you be free to bring as many bow  arrow a you wish that be as serious a i can get

visas and permits tourist visa to work visa good morning all  i want to buy a tourist visa  hotel visa  from any hotel for my wife  indian   my quesion be this hotel visa can we change to work visa   be it possibile or not   please give me advise  
hotels do n t usually give nocs  so i do n t think it can be transfer to work visa 
not possible to convert tourist visa to work visa  why do n t you bring your wife here under your sponsorship  
yeah you can transfer that but be sure that she havwe work visa before come here or else she will pay the penalty which be 200 day afetr expiry  
why dont u get a family visa for her  and she will be under your sponsorship which allow her to work easily  and save her from noc issue later  
elia you be the only sensible tiny voice in this silly insane choir  blu  wtf hotels have to do with noc  and why the hell his wife need the noc in the first place  since she have never have an rp in qatar   susan  you mix all in one big bunch of crap  if she have work visa prior to come  whf he would need to buy a tourist visa for her  and why the hell she would pay penalty 200 per day if she come here on tourist visa  be there any sense in your answer  gosh  why all these people be try to answer the question which they have no any clue about  and not only they be lack of basic knowledge  but most important they be lack of basic common sense  pity  
i dont have more than salary for sponsorship  i be hold one vacancy in my company for my wife  last month her visa application reject from labour department  thatswhy i try to hotel visa  after convert hotel visa to work visa  one another question be hotel visa need noc for work visa   because she be come in like a tourist after she get work visa from here  
alphy  since her work visa be reject  what make you think that switch any other type of visa to work visa will be easy  you misunderstand the process  mol do n t know where the perosn be  they do n t even care whether the person be here in qatar or back home  they either issue a work visa or they do not  once the work visa be approve and issue  then either the person be come to qatar  if he she be outside of qatar  or switch his her present visa status  tourist family business  to work visa  but the work visa must be approve and issue in any case regardless to where the person be  so it absolutely do n t matter where she be  you will only waste your money and time bring her on tourist visa and get rejection of her work visa again  does your compnay have a quota for indian female in the first place  it be very difficult to get nowadays  
it be very hard to get work visa for south asian and southeast asian lady  it be best to get her a family visa and get work under your sponsorship  all of our recently hire lady be husband sponsored since the company could not get work visa for single  lady  
the answer be no  there s no such thing a noc from hotel visa ok  hotel visa be valid only  base on your stay in the hotel in qatar  that s it  if you want her to come here in doha  it be either you sponsor her  from your company   or complete her cv and submit it to company which have vacancy  some company  one they accept the application of the employee  shoulder the visa from the country of origin  ticket to doha  etc  that s what i do  i m not sure why your company reject her application  maybe you should try other company  goodluck  ciao  
i want to work in qatar  can anybody link me up with a sponsor so i can easily get noc

my cmpny agree to change my prof  dnt knw how long will it take  but ofcos it be possibl wit high edu certficts  every lady hop that her daughter will marry a good man than she do  and be convince that her son will never find a wife as good a his father do    
i be ready to pay for the charge even it be 3000 qr so money be not a problem here but our sponsor here be say that immigration be reject the application for profession change 
 i use to be an electrician in my visa a we dont have a visa for professional way back in 2005  now it be stamp accord to what i do now in our company  it take them 2 week ot process it  they submit my authenticated diploma and noc from my employer    fascinated with supercars but can t afford it yet  so i settle down for a humble jeepney  proud noypi     
you can do it on your visa renewal  just submit your certificates diplomas  they have to change it for you  unless the company do n t have a visa for the certain positions nationals  coz before issue visa on particular name  company have to get an aproval for the certain nationality and position  and then they apply your name to this visa  
i have my profession change upon my renewal  but not the exact profession accord to my diploma since the company have no available visa for such position  i be plan to have it change again on my next renewal  i think i ve discover the secret of life  you just hang around until you get use to it  charles schulz 
it be important  get an noc from sponser  first get the application form for profession change  get your sponser sign  seal on that paper then goto labour dept  near to american hosp  along with  1  sponser id copy 2  munciplaity bill 3  edu  qual copy  should be transalted  4  bank stmt  6 month  5  aggriment contract  3 new   newly print  6  aggriment contract  3 old  already sign  7  your pp  visa and id copy  submit this and get sign from officer he be sit in 3rd floor  once you get the sign goto the near office for attestaion of your contract   new 3   while attestation you have to pay 50 qr  wait for another 10 day and get immigration office  garaffa  and show your receipt from labour by show them the new application for id change with your photo  then go buiding no  1 and submit your application there  you have to pay 300 qr  on the spot you will get your new id and visa sticker on your pp  go ahead good luck for you  i just change recently

nice trey so pwede ko n pala apply ng residence visa yung wife  son ko  khit 3 month bank statement makita ko   
hi my husband and i just go through the whole rp thing  we have to give 4 month worth of bank statement so you should double check  will save you alot of run around 
i be go to add  you good check with your company liason officer a to the bank statement  i think it depend on your salary as well because a friend be ask for a 6 month bank statement  
it depend on your company s pro c connection with the authority  i get family visa with 3 month bank statement  no water or electricity bill be produce  
some say 3 month  some say  4 month   maybe i will take chance for 3 months who know  if they reject my application  ill try 4 month  up to six month  be it possible    
better ask first your pro because some bank charge you per bank statement  cbq charge 50qr per bank statement be it 6  4  or 3 month  since they will charge me anyway  i get 6 month statement instead of just 3 to be sure  
is birth certificate of wife be really require   and bytheway  waht be mofa  
ministry of foreign affairs  
visas and permits family visit visa what be the requirement and cost for family visit visa and whom should i contact to arrange for me the visa  
check at moi qa website for more inforamtion  you need to get sponsor by a relative resident in qatar  
submit your document  filled form  your passport copy  letter from your job  family passport copy  they will charge 200 per person  khallaaaas   
contact no one do it urself 1  fill a family visit visa aplication form  online or at any typist for 5 qr  preferably in arabic 2  passport copy of yours and your visitor s  3  company letter state your salary  must be  5 000qr  and that they provide u family accomodation  if not  provide no 4  and no objection from your sponsor that u bring ur family for visit  4  rental contract  stamp by baladiya   5  qr  200 processing fee for each visa but in credit card  no cash a  in case of a wife  attest marriage certificate b  in case of child  attest birth certificate  all the above mention for each visitor visa  so 3 visitors  3 copy of ur passeport  3 company letter  3 visit visa application  
i hear moi require 6 month bank s statement  it make difficult for new comer  they have to wait to complete six month in qatar to sponsor their family  
no victory  6 month bank account for family residence visa  
my application for family visit be reject by immigration dept 2 day before even with qar9000 salary    
its very difficult to believe your above comment  becoz  salary requirement for visit visa be 5000qr or 5500qr definitely not above that  your family visit visa application might get reject not because of ur salary  it might be due to some other reason  
laidahmad agree with sanooj  who be u try to bring  if close family member usually there be no problem  but i know many who saw refusal to bring mother in law  or distant relative is ur accomodation a family one  if ur contract say bachelor accomodation be provide  than they may refuse it  is ur occupation compatible with the 9000 qr  a driver maid construction worker for example  just an example  no bashing  say that he get 9 000  the commission may doubt it  just ask them why they refuse the application  and accordingly bring proof  rental copy or a kahrama bill to proove a family accomo  6 month bank statement if they doubt ur salary  family document to prouve family tie    
in the case family visit visa   marriage certificate or birth certificate need not to be attest   no need of company letter for each  only one letter but copy should be attach with each application   no need of baladiya stamp on rental agreement  just to get a rental agreement from a real estate license holder  try to prepare all the document before you go to moi  if one they reject  it be very difficult to get it approved  good luck  
thanks everyone

how can i live in doha for long time  say easy but come to reality isas easy a say  come here doha for a few month only and now feel like to live here but a a family condition this be not an easy decision as well  none of family member be not possible to come and live with me  so what be the best option to live here in doha without family  
qatar living lounge how to spend time on weekend at doha  gets very bore on weekend i guess  last weekend be one of the slowest in a long time i be wait for it to get over what do people do on weekend here  
   only in dreams never in reality   get use to it   that be life in doha  dry and boring  try to find out how you make ur week end worth  go for tennis  go for dancing  go for cinema  go for gym  go in the kornish  to see crowd    if you have car  just drive and drive road trip if you be not easy to gain weight  do the food trip    
go to beach  mall long walk  health spa etc etc etc so many thing to do only no time weekend go so fast when you have good friend to spend time with but when alone doha be a hell of a place to be so make some good friend fast but take care on how you choose your friend 
think of something  then try it here  like visit the desert  well  i know it s not new to some of you  but it s new to me  doha have plenty of nice restaurant to go to  after eat  peace and relaxation be easy to find here  it s everywhere  go for spa in al sharq  go have a drink  try the night life  try cinema 9 at city center one of those have nice couch  try horse back rid  learn how to motorbike  try skating  try moroccan food  try indian food  filipino food  thai food  try play a ps3  try wii  sorry   get carry away   hunt for new gadget  doha have quiet good price item  laptop be cheap here compare in most country  the high demand for it have bring down the price  if i be n t able to help you still  there be lot of group who always socialize every weekend  there s some nationalistic group  art group  religious group  hobby group  you ll be able to find them in book guide like marhaba  qatar ha

here be a few  not try and test  but you can always get adventorous  1  ask personal question to the most snobish salesman at a snobish outlet  2  talk in a higly accented english with the same snobish salesman  rehearse beforehand  another way to kill time   3  give a fake smile to people at corniche  make it snappy like a flash  4  make funny scary face at kid on corniche  5  make a list of all swear word you know and keep the list ready for use  in purse besides phone in your car   6  if you be work than prepare a list of important phone number in the small font possible and stick it on your computer monitor with a bright sticker  think and analyse the reaction of your work mate on weekend  bye and cheer  
shop  eat go for walk  play some sport  join a gym  go for water sprts like jet sking and stuff  meet up wid frnds  ton to do mate  
alexa  do u have any recommendation for good tailor  i go to the souq waqif this morning  on my own   and buy some material  and want to make some simple long trouser  no idea where to go  use to go to fitwell in the past the one near burger king roundabout  but i think i ask around first if any other recommendation  
it s not what you do  or what there be to do  it s who you do it with  a weekend alone be not good  you need to meet someone or some friend to spend time with  then the weekend will be too short  although there be much to do in doha  it be bore do it alone  take up a new sport or hobby that involve meet people  i start play golf and meet load of people  let me know how you get on  rob 
normally in the week end if dh be not work we go dune bashing n then camp for the night o rif the weather i snot good for that we will have friend come over for dinner and drink or we go over to friend  always make sure there be something to do else ya will get bored    o  life s too short so make the most of it  you only live but once    
right alexa no problem go and lie down to get well for friday xxx 
moving to qatar commute time doha airport hi all  husband and i will be move to doha in january  we re look at lusail pearl area  but he will be work at the doha airport  any idea on what the commute time be in the mornings afternoons  thanks so much  kiki 
morning  6 30 7 00am   it take almost 40 45 minute  afternoon  if there be no traffic  30 minute                            i do n t want a signature line to prove that i m great   
thanks  how awesome  i be think it be more like 1 5 hour from what everyone have say about doha traffic     being here in the usa be a bit difficult to find out what area be best to live in doha  my husband and i love be at home  we prefer high rise with a nice gym though give we be bring motorcycle over i be think somthingh be a garage might be best  we have no kid so school and have other kid around u be not a top priority  given this  which areas buildings would you guy recommend  we do n t want to commute more than say 30 40 minute each way if we can help it  to and from new doha airport   what information be there out there about the pearl  i imagine be still be mostly a huge construction site but be there finish buildigns there worth commute to and from  are shop area and restaurant nearby already finish  thanks so much  kiki 
wow  in lusail pearl area    hmmm that s too expensive to live on there  hehhe  there s a lot of villa s here which you can stay peacefully  i ve forget the name of it  so  you re from florida   because your name be kikifl  kiki your name then fl be your place  be i right   hehehe  then   you like photography also  professional   hehehe  that s cool  there s a lot of nice place here to be take a shot in your cam  
 qatar s property development website be mislead a most of qatar itself  what you see be not what you ll get  lusail be a   plan new city   due to open soon but you go there now  all you ll se be an empty desert land with maybe 2 tower crane  pearl be nearly complete but with a lot of infrastructure and other nature problem  both location be at the north outskirt limit of the city  while the new airport be be build at the southern outskirt limit of the city  you do have to across the whole city and the traffic here be another nightmare  not only the traffic jam but also the aggressive and risk drive local style   if no traffic  it will be a 20 30 minute drive  the best location for you would be near by the marriott hotel  a friendly advice  be prepare for the big frustration you ever experience at professional and social level and you wo n t be disappoint  i wish you all the best   
then you go around the place and select for your self  there be plenty of accomodations available with few people to occupy it  depend on your budget  real estate be come down  taste differs from person to person  good luck 
 yes i m from florida and yes photography pay some  of our bill   husband get contract to work in doha so i be think the expensive part of live arrangement there will all depend on what his contract stipulates  thanks for the real estate agent contact mdobrasz  will see if we can start line up some visit to different area and take a look at villa v condo  not sure what be best for u yet  i think give we be go to try to bring our 2 motorcycle a house with a garage will be best  nic  thanks for the advice  i think we ll probably opt to be closet to airport than to drive 1 hour to get to and from work  so far i have see very little   real   picture of doha  mostly plan and projection image of what it will  look like so we figure we re in for huge construction site in the desert    
if you be in doha for a long term contract  it may be cheap just to buy new bike than have them ship  pay gcc taxes  registration etc  etc   just a thought   
dohadiesel  do you know where i can go to find out how much tax be and what need to be do to clear the bike through custom once we ship them  they be custom chopper  doubt i will find anything like it there  grant  give what i d hear about drive in doha i m not sure we ll even ue them there  after a first visit we ll decide    thanks for the info  
hi  i be not actually in doha yet myself  arrive at the end of this month  the only vehcile import i have do in doha previously be for the oilfield market  and be do slightly differently  you might be surprise  i see a couple of big bike shop here in doha when i visted a few week back  anyhow  in dubai a few year ago  i import some chopper from the guy off discovery channel program  the duty be 5  of the cif value   eg  bike be us  20000 cif then duty will be us  1000  i then have to pay a local agent commission on the import of us  1500 each a they hold the import licence agreement for the bike  therafter  police inspection  registration and other detail be approx   1200 per bike  then of course you will have standard insurance and road tax  which i believe be approx   100 per month in doha   someone can correct me if i be wrong  pm me if you need further information  i do work in this field and can get a colleague to check all the in and out if require  have   
my husband be a life long motorcycle junkie  got his first when he be about 10 year old  he would never consider rid one here in doha  traffic be very dangerous  they have the high accident rate per caput in the entire world  check out some you tube video show all the spectacular car crash in doha  you have to see it to believe it  seriously most people see a car crash every single day  riding motorcycle on the street in doha be only for fool in my opinion  
salary and allowances working in hamad medical center  be it good  anyone here who s a filipino work for hamad medical center  was it ok to work there  as a filipino who will be get qr 6  500 be that enough  
is that qr 6500 altogether include your allowance or be it just you basic salary  
if you re single and do not have a big responsibility to provide financially for your family then it s more than enough  btw  be that you re basic salary only or the whole package  dura lex sed lex  
that be the total package  all inclusive  obviously they be not give you housing allowance  qr5  000   then they should be provide housing  i guess thats the best package that qatar have to offer  if they can house you at the medical city  with shuttle bus service to work  then it will be the best  
5500 be just the salary  allowance be at 1000 total of 6500 
housing be free by the way  thanks for answer my question

moving to qatar personal loan and work termination i be currently work here in qatar  our employer inform u that they will transfer to contractor with less salary  but we have option not to accept  but the problem be i have personal loan in one of the bank here in doha  what if i will not accept the offer  what will happen to me  i mean do the bank will force to pay or not  
haha  so you want to get away without pay the loan  
not really  but iam just curious what if the company be the cause of termination  
yes  but your loan and contract be with the bank  
you mean even the cause of termination be the company  the bank will force me to pay   and wat if i find new job with less salary war will happen do they reduce my monthly fee  
i be sure you can renegotiate the repayment with the bank  
ah okay  because i be just worry  but not pay and run from my debt be not my option  i do believe in karma  thanks for the info  
you re welcome  i hope it all work out for you  
fact  if your company terminate you  take that letter to your bank  you wo n t be require to pay any remain amount  bank will use it tact  do n t yield  after few day of delay  finally you will get clearance from bank and fly home  insurer of your money  bank would pay that amount to bank  may be insurer and bank be have office in the same building  or manager be cousin  they be after your money  so escape clear from both party  pray hard  good luck in find another job soon somewhere  regards  
would you believe if i say 1000 have leave without repay a single coin in case your company terminate you  what for you pay premium every month my friend  
this be interesting  i do not know this  to be honest  i be surprised that this be possible  but good for those who have bank loan

visas and permits deportation a friend of mine get deport in february and he need my help  he be not a criminal no  he have problem with his manager and they didnt get to an agreement  the company couldnt release him and his stubborness get him deport  his rp be only cancelled normally a a normal exit and he doesnt have a deportee sticker on his passport  is there any chance for him to return to doha  and who have this information  can i call someone and check if he can return back  immigration maybe  
the best person to answer this would be your pr guy  in principle he can return  
deport  so i think no chance of come back 
maybe come in on a tourist visa but without an noc can not work 
no i mean  i also think it impossible  but i want to call and check with the person concern  my experience with the goverment be actually not bad when i inquire about him before and just want to do him a favor and check  
do they put a cancel stamp on the rp page in his passport  if so  he can enter only after 2 yrs  
if he be cancelled without deported stamp  he can come back immediately on a business or visit visa  he can not transfer to work visa without an noc  he might need to wait for 6 month before he can work again  
take his passport copy to immigration department near departure terminal and check if he have any ban or not   
humanresources doha  he can not come on business visa without noc  when you people will understand that business visa be a work type of visa  but for the short period of time   and he can not work in qatar without noc  and ban period be 2 year  not 6 month

i like doha well then dubai  because be more quiet city and i get everything i need here  i have wonderful life back home  i have my family  friend and place to hangout enjoy  but once i settle here  all change but good changed  it just different and i somehow can appreciate the differences  
i m not enjoy my stay here coz we have curfew  we have to work  work and work that s why we be so sad and bored i d like to go to dubai   img nid 48103 title  desc link none align left width 98 height 98  you will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consist of  you will never live if you be look for the meaning of life  albert camus 
it quiet  but you can find thing to do if you really want to  now being happy will depend on a lot of thing  to be honest  are you single do you have a very active night life  etc  i do n t have a curfew i think that might depend upon what job you have and the requirement  active night life there be one but it limited  i see you be from the uk will be honest with you and say it nothing like the pub scene back there  clubs and pub be locate only in hotel  easy to get around if you drive but you have to be aggressive in your driving manner and defensive    i just like it here  for many many reason  but you do need to look at all the perspective before come here  one main one be that the riyal be peg to the dollar not the english pound  
i be here because my husband  he be my sponsor  i have work but i dont change my sponsorship  i can leave the company anytime i want and leave the country anytime i want  i have friend around keep me busy  i have solon to pamper my self  i go to nice restaurant when i miss home  i go to club when i want dance  i can find all i need here in doha  dubai be nice and big city then doha  sure the malls there get more to offer but so much traffic just to go one place to another  doha be well in my opinion for living  dubai only for shopping  
i would n t say i enjoy live in doha  but right now i do n t hate it either  let s say i m ok with it  because i know it s only a few more month                                   http  www freewebs com qatarpets

why ask only the lady  i would rather have one rise and a kind word from a friend while i m here than a whole truck load when i m go 
either that or i m pretty simple lol i think i ll take positive attitude   actually  i m easily entertained and do n t believe in get bore because there s always something to do might not be what you have in mind tho  but look at the star on a clear night  go out with friend for coffee and laugh until you get silly  ok do n t take long   simple pleasures  i enjoy your sense of humor bc  you re a bit off the wall    
be always busy look at women   just kid hon    
tcom    you should now better  woman have a different way of look at what make them happy and what they need to feel happy and enjoy themselves     we men    well we see thing differently sometimes 
visas and permits maximum period of a visit visa  i m currently in doha on a 3 month visit visa  anybody can please tell me  whether i can extend this futher more  maximum of how many month  
maximum 6 months brother after that you have to exit from qatar  
after 6 month you can get an extension also   
i be on tourist visa for 1 month  can i also get extension  for how many month and how much  tnx a lot  
you ca n t get an extension  may be i could be wrong  but extension be valid for family visa holder  after they have clear their medical  
no extension for tourist visa i think  
ok  tnx a lot  do you know any company hiring for office staff  
you can also extend your tourist visa but very costly a compare with extend a family visit visa  maybe what you can do be exit from qatar then  after three month  apply again for a family visit visa  if you have a relative here  
you can extend a family visit visa for a maximum six month  but in any case that you have to extend it again after your 6 month limit  you can do that  too  i think upto 1 month  more  you just have to submit application form again to immigration with your flight booking detail  
hi rtaure tnx  what be the requirement in extend tourist visa and how much  if i exit  i can go back in qatar after 3 month  
you guy be mix family visit visa and tourist visit visa  family visit visa  when you be sponsor by one of your family member  initially be valid for 1 month  and can be extend later for another 5 month  total 6 month stay  after undergo medical examination  tourist visit visa be be valid for 30 day and can be extend for another 30 day  60 day stay in total

200  300 qar hour be the go rate out here  if you do n t want to pay that much  i know that the not native english speaking folk here charge much less for private lesson   
asking 250 per hour   it good to hire one teacher permanently for you childern

shortening be available all over  try the oil aisles  down with the ghee  i think i buy mine in the carrefour in city centre  have n t see bran  have n t really look though  not sure it that readily available  try the cold cereal aisle  perhaps that explain the rather white brown bread  the rye bread i buy today must have have only 1 grain of rye a well  be delicious  but not very strong in the rye department  another ingredient that seem to be fairly rare be bake soda  can always find baking powder  
bake soda  i just buy it yesterday at shoprite   life s too short so make the most of it  you only live but once    
yes  i bake  a lot   you can find shortening  crisco  at carrefours and or megamart  or shoprite  occasionally  wheat bran i saw at megamart just this morning with the other grain  3rd aisle from the left of the store  back section  i believe   postmodernman  bake soda be now readily available at megamart and shoprite on a regular basis  if you have problem  look for bicarbonate of soda same thing  ohh and i just find jif peanut butter at megamart  yeah    most folk be about as happy a they make up their mind to be   abraham lincoln  1809  1865  
scarlett  do they finally have creamy pb  or just chunky  
i love jiff and be about to have my son ship me some from texas but i be saved    most folk be about as happy a they make up their mind to be   abraham lincoln  1809  1865

ooh  i ca n t get there till tomorrow  if anyone go to megamart tonight  can you hide a jar creamy pb behind the spaghetti sauce for me  lol 
let s bake ksa some peanut butter cooky  lololol ksa

i know  seems like they always have kisses  except when you need them  then they just have two packs bundle together of the kind no one want  i e  white chocolate  white chocolate be not chocolate   
doha shopping food allergies my child have recently be diagnose with food allergy  where can i buy wheat free product  or milk free product  or cheese free product  
my god  there will be nothing leave to eat for the poor thing  what about calcium    
i have to try that diet for one of my kid briefly to test for allergy  turn out she be just always sick a her allergy test come out negative     not too much in doha  but mega mart probably have the best selection  
or cook from scratch  
i have start cook from scratch which be probably healthier but it time consume with three different diet  in the uk you can buy wheat free  milk free and lactose free product  i do find wheat free flour sporadically from megamart and soya milk be n t too hard to find but most of it taste bad  
i be suppose to be wheat intolerant but in this country i have give up and be bloat all the time  mega mart also have wheat free flour to make your own bread  double up great for pizza base  carrefore occasionally stock wheat free nut bread  simple treat for you to try be 1 c peanut butter  1 c sugar  1 egg  mix all together  put spoonful on a greased tray and bake at 180 for about 20min  golden   they may come out a little soft but will harden  good luck  i may be blonde but i be wise smile lot laugh more 
 megamart do have the best selection  edensoy milk be some of the best tasting  especially vanilla   it come fortify in some variety  read label on everything  if the product be from the us  it will list contains milk in bold letter on the bottom of the ingredient  some poptarts be milk free  cinnamon  strawberry  and apple flavor   be cautious with chocolate  milk be in all cadbury chocolate  some dark brand be vegan  megamart also have soya margarine and   smart balance   butterflavored spread on occasion  my advice be to stock up when they have it  also be careful when buy bread  a many have milk a an ingredient  i have n t find any dairy free cheese in doha  is the allergy just cow s milk  can goat or sheep cheese be use  the pharmacy in city center have chewy bear calcium vitamin if you be look for supplement  good luck   
i be just focus on milk free  so what i say about pop tarts and bread do n t count  
megamart have wheat free loaf of bread and box of pasta  well  the pasta be kamut  which should be ok   the bread may be sell out if you visit just after my wife s be there  
veni  vidi  viva

qatar living lounge how can i cook these fish  can anyone help me to choose and cook some of the fish i see in the supermarket  but have never hear of  i also find many of the vegetable new  can anyone list the most frequent fish and recommend a recipe  many thanks 
why do n t you buy a cook book  martha stewart be sick so she could n t possibly help you at this moment     cheer  paul 
 just go online  find out what it be  then find recipie that you would like to try  
here alot of fish type  the best  easy be hamoor filet just put them in salt  lemon  crush garlic for few minute then cover with flour then fry them 
do n t forget to tell me the result  
there be also kana ad fish but you ll get them slice with a small bone in the middle same recipe like the hamoor 
throw it on the bbq  
add some ginger with the garlic and limon 
grill them  then they do n t taste of burnt oil  better still  steam them over a bed of baby spinach  you can even do this in a microwave    did you google it first  
this work with any white fish fillet  it s particularly nice with parrot fish  examine the fillet closely  and remove any scale and bone miss by the fishmonger  fry some finely chopped onion until soft  then add crushed garlic  dice carrot and celery  with a little salt  cover and sweat for five minute  add about 500ml vegetable stock and simmer until the vegetable be cook  remove the vegetable with a sieve  then cook the fish fillet in the simmer stock until the flesh have set  no more than 10 minute   serve the fish and vegetable with creamy mash potato  
take a whole sherry  gutted and clean  stuff the cavity with mix pepper  onion and garlic  coat the skin with thinly sliced lemon  wrap in foil and stick it on the bbq for 10 minute  the fish will cook in it s own juice and the lemon stop the flesh from stick to the foil  o  did you google it first

qatar living lounge help  the preview comment function be get on my nervs  any chance i can get rid of it and post comment straight away  
 it be there for a reason  earlier  there be instance when people write something before check what they have write  it blow out of proportion and there be a lot of hungama on line  ql mod instal it just to make sure that you be type exactly what you want others to read  it be a way of avoid people from make the excuse that   i didnt know that be what i type    etc  it may be annoy  but it necessary  just my thought   
 yes  the reason be that when the site be slow  which happen every now and then  the preview function make it even more annoying and slow to post a comment  i don t think it serve to any purpose  i never bother to re read what i type and and roll down to press submit a quickly a possible  i don t think that the preview function will stop some people from post bs at time  i wonder how many member   really   preview their comment before post   
try use firefox for ql that sure will help alot and it faster then ie too   img nid 21285 title desc link none align left width 180 height 180  
delete 
i really hate it too  i never reread again what i write one time  you can preview it even if you just double check before you post it  so this function be just so unnecessary  
i be the only one  even with the preview function i either still get it wrong or dissatisfy with what i write  it just slow me down but on the upside im more picky when it come to contribute to certain thread and more concerned about the quality of my writing  which be still bad me think   p 
 i love the preview function  makes me think twice before hit   post    also  i hope it stop user from use this forum a a casual chat lounge with one line message   
but certainly have use the edit one    
because of an irritate few everyone else suffers  even after the introduction of this feature the irritant be still there  its the ordinary ppl who suffer everywhere 
 i despise the preview function  i ca n t be bother to edit what i put on the internet    i fight with love and i laugh with rage  you have to live light enough to see the humor and long enough to see some change    ani difranco

did you try to read well what i write    gossh     put on your eyeglass and try once again to read well  i raise a topic to know opinion about it  not to date or encourage date  people like you be one who lead others to misunderstanding  besides  how old be you  you remind me of a friend in elementary who use to threaten u to tell the teacher that we be eat in secret  grow up  and read  understand  analize think and then answer  me  myself   i 
i think it work about 45   since you dont know anything about the person  so it will be luck to find someone you adapt to  try me  he he he  
will be salacious  i know very well how ppl will express their blind date you say share you opinion and experience 
mortal  i guess it work less than 45   usually i dislike be in darkness or walking to the unknown  that be why i want to know if everyone think the same a myself  but it might work for others  who know  me  myself   i 
eco  if you be seek blind date in website  not everyone be do the same dear  express yourself the way you want but do not let your expression bother others please  i can not believe the way you react to a simple discussion  we come here to breath away from our tough life and hard work  to communicate  to find some nice new friend  not to compete and show muscules      you think you know people  well  try harder  me  myself   i 
hey  next time get yourself to a place where u r comfy  with ppl around  dont go walk alone with him anywhere  especially dark place  there be plenty of hangout like that  make it semi blind  dont budge out with a complete stranger unless your heart tell you so  always take pride in yourself and limit yourself not to be open up on the first note  show that you care about your womanhood  best wish hunting  
mortal  what do you say  you also do not get my point  seems my english be a little bit tough on you  lol walking to the unknown and be in darkness be a metaphore  phrases to discribe an emotional sitaution not something i do  i be a girl who respect herself more than you can imagine and educated mannered enough to know right from wrong  thank you for your comment anyways  me  myself   i 
qatar living lounge  traffic in india v traffic in doha i be curse here many time for be   racist   when i say that the big danger on the road be bus  truck and bike driver from subcontinent  just watch this video  http  www youtube com watch  v rjreqag5jpm they come to doha use to drive and walk like this  no lane  no rule  no traffic light  and continue behave exactly the same way on the street of doha  ca n t wait for the police to enforce the new traffic rule   
i will personally make up flask of tea  after iftar   and take biscuit to the traffic police so they will enforce the rule and do n t need to go off and get a cuppa  i be sure i be not the only person really hop that these rule will be enforce to the max  terramax i totally agree  
at least we have a road network n in all that chaos there be a system n we don t have much accident http  www youtube com watch  v ag9jwwkv2ru  mode related  search  http  www youtube com watch  v t54jhkr1jz8 if you ca n t change your fate  change your attitude  
some more for u to ponder ppl who stay in glass house should not throw stone at others http  www youtube com watch  v gga9nbx8ezc if you ca n t change your fate  change your attitude  
agree with you terramax  should n t i migrate to brazil now  i love the samba and footballer there  
note one more thing in that indian  video terramax  just observe the speed of vehicle  not more than 30 40 i be afraid and not a single 4x4 drive  now imagine the same thing on doha or brazil road with all suvs with speed over 120  just imagine  you can even add drunk driver from another video and watch the fun  with tea and biscuit   img nid 22259 title fruity kitty desc link none align left width 135 height 180  
 t  i agree there be a system  but this be your system and it work there  the fact that a majority of the driver on the road be from subcontinent  do n t mean they can bring their   system   with them  lara123  there be enough brazilian football player in doha  but definitely much less than indian driver  btw  i see no point in you guy attack brazilians  for your info  i be not a brazilian   pointing finger will not change the fact that the majority of the driver on the doha road be your compatriot  and the   industrial    especially those who drive white tata bus with worker  driver should n t be give license even to walk   
shreeya  sure  that s my point as well  they behave same here  i e  drive 40 without observe lane  turn where they want to  without indicate  jaywalk in the middle of the road  so when someone  not only a suv at 120  but a car driving at 60 to 80 come  the accident be inevitable  just go to najma in the end of the day to see the same  there be even kid play in the middle of the street  
u r wrong driver here adder to the rule n speed limit of qatar n talk of walking  u wont see much from the subcontinent ppl jay walking in the middle of the road  next time open your eye n u will know who r jay walk n talk of play on the road indian parent never allow their child to go out without supervision leave alone play your view r so distorted this be why we have label u racist  n last of all if u r not from brazil plz do change your profile be proud of your country n not sham of it if you ca n t change your fate  change your attitude  
terramax  people from all country be reside in najma area  there be pionys  pakistanis  bangladeshis  somalians  egyptians and all others    why to blame it on only indian driver  the road be so conjusted with the unique beautiful design of biiiiig roundabout and smaaaaal circulate road  still i be yet to observe any big accident on these road  believe me a i be a daily commuter on these road  you have to agree the fact that behind every accident there be a suv  fortunately not drive by subcontinent driver   img nid 22259 title fruity kitty desc link none align left width 135 height 180

investment and finance  nri banking wanted to open a bank account where fund could be transfer online from a local bank here in qatar to an nre nri rupee account to an indian bank in india  came across two such option but unable to decide  which be the good option in term of feature  ease of use  exchange rate and security  doha axis bank tie up or commercial  icici bank aka   nridirect account   for indians in qatar   
go for commercial bank  a you can have direct investment option in indian equity and mutual fund link with your icici nri account in india  
if you be just look to open a nre account where your overseas earning can be save  i will suggest you  citibank   if it branch available in your city of india or you can choose the near available city to open a account  the best thing about this bank be there be no charge for bank transaction unlike other private bank charge  kindly visit www citinri com all my best wish 
in these time of financial turbulence go for sbi  u can open an nre account and thats the best bank  never ever think of hdfc bank as they have a very poor service lots of formalities and the dsa here dont even know the rbi guidelines  talking to them is like talking to unprofessional people  i wonder why qnb tied up with them  by the way all banks give u now same intrest rates  repartiation  cbs services and additional portfolio services 
according to my experience  open nri direct account with commercial bank  icici bank  this give you current account in commercial bank  nre account in icici bank  if you be interested in share mutual fund online trading then icici online trading account facility be best  you can transfer money from commercial bank account to your icici nre account online  transfer happen in one work day  also i would like to mention one point here that for online money transfer  dohabank exchange rate be always good than commercial bank  so for me i have also open a dohabank saving account which i use for online money transfer to icici nre account  this transfer be also fast  most of the time one work day  
go for nationalised bank like sbi  trust exchange will assist you to open an account with sbi  all the best  
my opinion be to go for doha bank axis bank better exchange rate axis bank service be much good than hdfc or icici bank  
gentlman  go for sbi nre account  safe  secure  reliable they have online banking with all good feature like save account with international debit card  demat  bill payment and fund transfer through neft rtgs  24x7 toll free customer support etc  gone be the day when we use to look for bank in qatar with a tie up with indian bank  now with e remittance facility you can quickly transfer fund to almost all bank in india  have a nice weekend  
dohabank axis bank this is best link for remitting money to india  online transfer be very easy and on the spot no any concern  im use this facility from last 4 year  
my experience with doha bank axis bank for the past 3 year have be very satisfactory  the transfer online occur instantly most of the time and the rate offer by doha bank be the best in here compare to all other bank and the exchange house  the customer service by axis bank in india  at least in kochi  kerala  be excellent  i do have an sbi nre account but i still would prefer remittance do to axis bank a the money get credit to axis bank account much fast than to sbi account  
go for axis bank with doha bank  get a reference you can contact 55982586 for the account opening process

lol    
 this topic have be widely cover in many previous thread  use the search engin to find several forum topic that treat this subject  the bottom line be  there be no such thing a   best bank    the concept of customer service and satisfaction be unknown  they be all sub standard  procedure and response time  light years away from western bank  choose from the name mention above  the most convenient for you to use   
the one and only best bank be qnb  in my 14 year of experience 
any idea about cbq   img nid 22259 title desc link none align right width 135 height 180  
avail the low interest rate for car loan  
well i think it s a rip off  no such thing a the best bank  i leave doha bank because of poor customer service and go to qnb which be happy with  with qnb  you have to have a minimum of qr 3  000 in your current account always  it s a compulsory saving scheme  plus  you get 25  in your saving account and if you take out a mortgage loan you pay 8 5   be careful  read the small print  i do n t trust bank here

advice and help bank account question i be new to doha and have only be here for 5 week now and my company be apply for my residency now but i wonder if i can open a bank account without residency or do i need to wait  also which bank do i go for  my only requirement be that the bank must have internet banking so i can transfer money to my bank account back in the uk so i can pay my mortgage etc  thanks 
you can open an account with just your passport and it have get internet banking  
you ll hv to get a letter from your company state your salary term and allowance  they ll immediately give you a new account  atm card along with a pin  credit card and cheque book  depend on the type of account   ofcourse you ll hv to submit your rp  once obtain  detail in a month time else they ll have to close the account so basically you can open you account and have your atm credit card  as well a their pin number  in 10 mins the best facility i ve see in this region the only thing i m not happy about be their qr 5  000 average balance to be maintained tht be a bit too much cash to have lock  
which be the best bank to go for then in either the hyatt plazza or the villagio  preferably one with internet banking and one that do n t need to have so much of my cash tie up  also do i need a letter off my company to get an account or can i go with just a copy of my passport  
cbq  commercial bank of qatar  have internet banking and a branch in hyatt plaza  if you make an initial deposit of qar 5000 i do n t think you need a letter from your employer  but you need a passport copy and rp copy  ibq be a very very nice bank  great customer service but they do n t have internet banking  
i do n t have residency yet but will have within the next couple of week max  so can i just go in with a copy of my passport and say qar 10000 and open an account or will i have to wait until i get my rp  
anyone   
i be fairly certain that you will need a letter from your company to open an account  
yeah you do i need a salary certificate a i pop in to the comercail bank in the hyatt plaza yesterday 
you need company letter to open an account 
a company letter or a salary certificate or would i need both

as you say  it s a new school  so it s difficult to confirm anything  i believe the building be not yet 100  complete  but it s nothing for you to worry about  since the school year will only start in september  good luck with the move  and with the heat when you get here   
they be well established in the uk  you can see their website here http  www acs schools com acs doha aspx i have tour the campus and have to say it s quite impressive  my son be at compass  which i be quite happy with  but you wo n t go wrong with acs doha either  here s some info from their website  the programme initially we will be offer our prestigious early years  lower school  and middle school curriculum  base on globally recognise american and international standard  with an aim to deliver the same range of academic programme successfully offer at our three uk campus  learn more   as the campus develop a high school we will also seek authorisation to offer prestigious us college board advanced placement  ap  course  acs doha will also offer an american high school honours diploma  the school will shortly be a member of the council of international schools  the doha campus offer a rigorous academic curriculum of english  mathematics  science  humanity  worl

qatar living lounge gyms in doha i   39  m move to doha soon  for five month initially  though it   39  s possible i may settle long term  i   39  d like some advice on any good gym in doha  i can   39  t seem to get any comprehensive information on the net  i   39  d like a pool  sauna  gym  and a climb wall would be a big plus  any idea or recommendation  how much would it cost  thanks for any help you can give me  
there be a couple of pure  gym i know of sas gym and gold s gym  this one you may not know of it unless you be american  which cater for the gym freak  the latter gym i believe be spoof in dodgeball  w  ben stiller and will farrell  however  there be a few that be health club which be what you be after in your description they be   al dana club diplomatic club doha club  but close soon  and club in major hotel intercon ramada ritz sheraton etc plus al sharq ritz carlton open soon and some other hotel i think most be pretty full  prices for single range from 3000qr to 8000qr per year appr  do not know of any with climb wall  can i ask do the numerous stadium have gyms that can be use  also  somewhere like aspire  can you use any of the facility there  plus  many housing compunds have all these facility  the quality depend on the compund offcourse  some be real nice such a mirage  al fardan  beverly hills  tbah etc some not so  
hi  would you know how much gold s gym s membership be  we have a lot of those in the philippines  also  would you be able to give me the address of the gold s gym  
i have n t get a clue  angel face  but i m glad you ask the question  maybe some doha veteran will help u out  i hear about gold s gym  but there do n t seem to be website  not a good sign  
i believe it s on d ring road  somewhere in the vicinity of the airport lulu s  
i personally have not be to it  but i would think that it the vast majority would be men  correct me if im wrong and i think you d feel uncomfartable  they be locate on d ring road  between mall r a and airport light  they have a big building and it be gold colour  do n t know about rate but my guess it not cheap a usual member would be weight lifter and bodybuilder  
gold s gym be close to the harley davidson showroom  at least i think it a harley davidson showroom  on d ring road  it s a big ugly golden building so you pretty much ca n t miss it  i do n t know how much the membership cost but i ve be tell it s a bit on the expensive side  
i hear this be the best  and from the photo it look killer  http  www qatarembassy net qatar  20gallery entertainments slides diplomatic  20club asp but i also hear it s expensive  anyone any idea what it cost for a 6 month membership  
do n t get take in by the name

sealine al wakra  al gharriya inland sea al khor just do n t rely that there would be a public beach around doha  everywhere there s development   
 i cant forget that place  me and ma auntie use to go there for swimming and hang around sad to know this story huhuhuhuh

the only really good beach for swim in doha be replace by the al sharq spa  the near beach now be outside the reach of anyone without a car  sad really

qatari culture be there any baptist church there in qatar  q247 
baptist here  i do n t know  but i think there be  you can also try a search in the search box  there have be a few discussion about this on ql  but seriously  why baptist or make this more complicated and divide by separate it into denomination  sigh  incase people do n t know what a baptist be  http  en wikipedia org wiki baptist 
 questions of labeling  excerpt from wiki  some who reject the label baptist prefer to be label a christians who attend baptist church  also  a recent trend  most common among megachurches and those embrace the   seeker movement    be to eliminate   baptist   from the church name  a it be perceive to be a   barrier   to reach person who have negative view of baptists  whether they be of a different church background or none the label denomination be reject by some because of the local autonomous governance system use by baptist church  being a denomination be view by them a have a hierarchy that substitute for the roman catholic church  another reason for the rejection of the label be the influence of the restoration period on baptist church  which emphasize a tear down of denominational barrier   
the baptist church be in the al khor valley of banana next to the born again virgins temple and the klu klux klan s burial chamber  yippeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  i love gin hic  
you can try doha fellowship   
it s near the virgin forest  
ofcourse yes  the church that bring the message of salvation to every creature  
there be a christian church at the abu hammour area where you can ask where the baptist congegration be  come on guy  the man be ask a question  how would you feel if he do what you have do  what do your belief say  do not do unto others what you do not want others to do to you  
not sure  who be the crowd who sing their hallelujahs at doha college on a friday  
hu wan  many people visit this thread do n t know what a baptist be  even many baptist themselves  
there be a qualify word church   have n t you think about that  ignorance be not an excuse  you could ve simply googled  it  
family life in qatar school wait list i have see some comment about wait list for school  i would like to know be this for all grade level   my son will be go to seventh grade will this be a problem     
at the moment most school be shut for the summer  there may be a few school where the admin staff be still in  all grade be full in most school  most school have very long wait list  however  come september there will be place because a lot wo n t come back from summer holiday and some get 1st 2nd choice  leave gap in wait list  
expatmomaua  7th grade be probably not as bad a the low grade  have you contact any school  when will you be in qatar  
hi love  it depend on the 7th grade  if it be year 7 english schools  busy a and full  grade 7 from other place  there may be place    x 
hi cabbage ok  thanks  do n t have that much insight a mine be in high grade  
no problem at all  i think we all forget at time when ours be old how difficult it can get    
he will be go to 7th grade us school system guess year 8 british schools   
yes that will be correct  most school ask for the child to take an entrance exam and he will be place in a year accord to his ability    
any recommendation on school   we usually look for school first and then housing  so location of the school be not an issue     
places have be fill by now and wait list will have be update  schools be not back now until begin of september  by that i mean school office  and i be almost sure that whatever school you pick  you will be place on the wait list  have a look at school suitable to your requirements   but be aware that the more waiting list you join  the good chance you have to get a place  but first you need to get here a no school will give you a chance to even join the wait list if you be not physically in qatar  
this be really late to be try to find a place for september  try and get his name into as many school a you re interested in asap  there be the asd  dess and doha college which be all probably consider to be the best  but because they be good  their waiting list can be long  some have recommend compass or sherbourne as well  do a little googling to see about facility and contact info  then start communicate with them

rayyan be the best    
there be two type of water natural mineral bottled drink water  go for natural choice rayyan great test value for your money  or try massafi  
manhal and nestle a the best  safa doesnt taste like mineral water a all  delivery for manhal and nestle be the best  ive be use for years

cleanest be giant s mineral water    
i would suggest that you boil the tap water and use for drinking or run the tap water through a filtration process system such a aqua guard or brittanica  agents be here in doha who would give you a demonstration and i understand the system cost you around 2000riyals but you have the liberty to pay in installment  but i have see the demonstration and you would see the difference what a tap water or mineral water  any brand  offer  the result be amazing and be sure that you would forget all this mineral water and opt for this system  unfortunately i dont ahve th no  of these filtration company agent personnel number  whenever i get it  i shall surely post it  cheer bob

salary and allowances is 30000 qar good enough salary for a couple to move to qatar  moving to qatar soon  have receive an offer of qar 30k  be that good enough for a couple to be in qatar  we have no kid  
that s good offer  welcome to qatar     
i be receive less than that and i have move to qatar with wife and 3 kid and yet somehow we manage to survive  surely 30k qr will be more than good enough for you and your wife to live and enjoy life in doha  
i be receive less than that and i have move to qatar with my wife and 3 kid and yet somehow we manage to survive  surely 30k qr will be more than good enough for you and your wife to live and enjoy life in doha  
oh come on  be you stupid or what  that be good money and you know it  if you ca n t figure out if that be a good enough salary then you do n t deserve that amount  
it depend on your live standard and expectation for saving  in this connection it be important to know do all allowance  specialy accomodation allowance  be include or not in this amount  for example rent of a villa will be in the range of 12  000  20  000 qr etc  good luck 
do you think that you will earn that amount in your country     cmon   and how come a lot of expats are coming to work instead in their home country      dont be so silly   
it depend if it be exclude the accomodation or include because if you want to live in a villa you need something like 10000 qr monthly and if it it be include then you will end up with 20000 which be enough to live a meduam life for you and your family to be honst i think it be a good salary for an engineer or maybe senior person so go a head and good luck 
depend which one be your life style  is the accommodation pay by company  and the car  3000 for rent   do you like compound villa  12000  or apartment  7000   do you like club  500 per month   do you like drink alcohol  500 per month   do you like go to restaurant  700 per month   your wife like new clothes  1000 per month   qr 30 000 be not enough for western couple  
if it s not at least 3x what you be earn in your home country then i think that would not be enough just my two cent 
for a manager from uk  it be reasonable  not too good  you need qr6500  2 br appartment with out gym  swim pool   14000  4br compound villa with swim pool  gym etc  for accomodation 2300 for car  300 for petrol  2500 for food  if you cook  2000 for week end outing  1500 for child education  all togeter around qr15000 will go a minimum expense  if you be bless with free accommodation  this salary be very good  
family life in qatar grocery budget    what be the average grocery budget here in doha for the family of 5 people 3 kid and two adult   serious answer only please i always make my monthly budget and always spend more  
maximum qar 2  000 per month 
5k month http  www youtube com watch  v bqvi48kzfmq 
all depend on what kind of livestyle you wan na live  you want to have nive thing  fresh milk  juice  cereal  good vegetable such a brocolli  mushroom and so on  then you gon na spend quite a bit  if you happy to have khubuz and cheese spread with a cup of tea then you wont be spend much  al depend  
everyone s monthly grocery expenditure will differ because of the place we shop at  someone shopping at lulu will have a different budget in contrast to someone shopping at megamart  shoprite  your expense will always depend on the brand of product you buy  
minhajj    you must be joke  5 people on qr 2  000 per month  my weekly shopping bill come to no less than qr800 so i think you must be live really really on basic thing 
veg or non veg 3 time daily heavy light meal place where you buy foodstuff all these have to be take into account 
2k or 3k or 5k  gone up by 40  in a year time  
now you re sound alien to me  40     
hmmm right i use to do my shopping from family food center then i switch to lulu but no difference i have 3 kid and for their school lunch and 3rd one be a toddler so for him offcourse milk bread and other thing like fruit  veg  mutton  chicken cheese these r the basics but minhajj a u say 2000 it be really impossible i start from 2000 but couldnt control to spend more  than i start 2500 which be also get not possible in the end i have to spend more  ahh now i be think maybe i be not a good house wife who can not make a right budget for my family or maybe here in doha thing r expensive     
is it that you ca n t afford it or you re just crib about the expense  it s for you and your kid anyways  so it be only befit you give them your best

i see a lot of people have already write a reasonable answer  but keep in mind following   about flat or car rental  depends who negotiate  if a european person or a westerner in general  forget it to find those rate  for them everything be double   a many have mention  depend on lifestyle  for example one of the most difficult issue for woman here  to find a normal hairdresser  beautician  etc  usually too expensive and very low quality  level of hygiene  if you go to a normal place  price be ridiculous for what you get

qatar living lounge diet pill inquiry my friend be quite overweight these past month upto these day      and she want to loose so fast   she s do exercise and all  but she want  u know  take some pill  so now  she find this xenical  i just want to know if anyone take this pill and be it really effective  just want to know all the info before she buy something   thank you   
get her to rule out any medical condition first for be overweight  always relate to hormone  u say she have be overweight for a few month  pls get it checked  if there be a hormonal imbalance u will put on weight  then you put on more weight and the hormonal imbalance keep on  it a vicious cycle   exercise n proper diet  which mean low fat and meal ateast 5 time a day  but small meal  how long do she exercise   u need to really workout max of 80mins to bring about weight loss  new study   keep a target of 3 month to see some proper weight loss and u have to keep at it  i dont know of xenical  have hear of actrim which be fruit extract  happy heart drive safe co someone be wait for u at home 
 xenical seperates the fat from the food that you eat  it teach you to eat healthy food that be low in fat  of course  the fat that be seperated have to come out somehow and i m sure you can guess how they come out  it s not a pretty picture  some friend of mine be take this and quit take it within the month  they do lose some weight but the   accident   be not worth it i guess  i think about try it but after their experience  i do n t think so   
i have read about actrim  it suppose to be side effect free  bcos they be just fruit and plant extract  and it available in the pharmacy  their literature state u can lose upto 4kg a month with actrim u eat and drink normally with exercise it shud be take after meals 4kg for over weight people come off easily  happy heart drive safe co someone be wait for u at home 
i do n t usually take anything that s not fda approve  reductil be and have a low risk of side effect and it be approve for long term use  alot of prescription diet pill be only short term  
i check on the actrim  great info  i like that it all natural  han  have you take it  actrim http  www ameinfo com 4263 html 
what to suggest  however  would suggest that she have her thyroid test before do anything  the last thing she want to do be mess that up  munozchick  be that drug available here over the counter  just ask a i hear that it be not and be only avialble by perscription  a friend of mine try that xenical  er no thanks  
plz can u tell me wich tv chennel i can watch asian game open ceremony  
i agree  she should go to the doctor first  most doctor be go to tell her not to take pill  however  that be up to her  she just need to get an all clear from the doctor that it be not your thyroid  research  research  research  it s so important to know what you re take  hassan  no clue  i m avoid the game at all cost  
i have a few friend who be use reductil and have find it great  it technically need to be purchase with a prescription  however  there be quite a few pharmacy that will sell it without the prescription   i be not endorse this behavior  but know that it be possible   
i have hear from lot of people that herbalife work really well as long a you do not eat greasy food  i have never be fat so i would not know  but i know a few guy who swear by it  any of you out there who can relate to my comment that herbalife work  i think if you can say it work it might be a good way to lose weight  anyway when compare to pill i think shake be well and also give you a chance to forget about meal and still have your require protien  carb and vitamin intake                             live free and die

i dont know if you would call mcdonalds a decent restaurant  but it will probably set you back 10 riyal for a mchicken 30 riyal for a small pizza  prob about 10 riyal for a drink  and rice would depend on where you order it from  ie whetehr it a fast food place from the mall or a restaurant

nice to see u again  love megamart though the price r a put off apart from that carrefour be pretty good to shop at and ur right i hate lulu  dunno if it the crowd or the place in general   
i like the villagio  the mall  the royal plaza  that s for the mall  for the supermarket i really like family food center near ryan  and lulu

their state be not their nationality as far a i know they hold indian passport  donot do unto others what u do n t want them do unto u   
reason for them call themselves keralite be they r in majority in gulf  among indian and otherwiese too   so they feel proud be kearalite in gulf   dev  some people have so much respect for their superior  they have none leave for themselves    
1  no  they be not ashamed to tell anyone they be from india  they just assume that you have figure it out that they be from india  it s not that hard to figure it out  and ur ask where they belong to from india      get the point    2  well ask too many question be to get to know the person sooner or to know his her background  u dont have to sweat worry about it  cheers    
how do they know i figure it out  i ask nationality       why do u want to know my background while i come for work to ur office     donot do unto others what u do n t want them do unto u   
what u say be a fact  i agree   when people ask me where i be from   i always say india  then they ask me which part of india  aana free  jaana free  pakde gaye tho khana free  
dotcom if i pass a smile it will be a very big issue after that  cause i have face it many time  donot do unto others what u do n t want them do unto u   
u might be from the 2   donot do unto others what u do n t want them do unto u   
bilu million time discuss allready  anyway i be from india  kerala   
1  may be it s your first experience and that s why you find it hard to identify indian  cant blame you  even i would have a problem identify an ethiopian and a person from zambia   2  getting to know your colleague at work be not such a bad thing  or be it   take a deep breath and you ll be just fine

socialising qatari men and western women ok guy i be go to prehaps tick someone off again but i have a question  not sunny but me  will a qatari man go out with a western christian girl  have sex with her and then move on because he think woman from the west be wild and sex crave  sunny have receive quite a bit response from qatari men who want to date her once we arrive  i even get an offer myself  but i believe it be a trap and i tell sunny be careful  any advice out there  
it be a very rare qatari man that would want anything more than what you just describe  it be a very rare man in qatar that want anything more to do with a western girl than you just describe  meeting men here be like step through a minefield  9 out of 10 of them just want sex  and they will do and say anything to get it from you  i be not bitter  i do not hate men  but i have be live in various part of asia for the last 2 and a half year  trust me when i say if you do not want to get burn be very careful who you date  asian opinion of western woman be not very high when it come to sex and dating  tell sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first  
if you be not look for a long time relationship  go for it  when it come to a question of sex  nationality  religion do not matter  that be my humble opinion  angelo 
i must tell you redcajun504 arab youth can go to any extent to get sex  but so be men from any country  men have always sex on mind  it be always advisable to be cautious  but why be you worry  there be a huge expat population here  which include indians  europeans  americans and even australians  so  it s not a problem basically  ask sunny to be prudent and approach the thing casually  without any pre conceived notion  though caution be utmost require  you never know you may actually get a gem of person among these arabians  after all  many of them have marry westerners  but dohagirl a such be correct that youth here always look for sex  on my own experience i must tell you they see russians  lebanese and filipinos a someone always available for sex  actually  this part of the world have many prostitute from these community  throng star hotel  use your common sense and thing will be cozy for you  i wish you and your sister best of luck  ambrish  ambarishjha  gmai   
life be not easy if you be a western woman  and the main reason a man from this part of the world would want a western woman be mainly for sex  however  please do not for one moment think that the men and woman here co n t have premarital relationship  they do it just not talk about and it be not caried out in the open  due to the conservative background of the boy they will always return to their family and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the family would not be happy about it  i think it be much good to be very cautious out here although there be a great many handsome men and they can be very charm go through the arab and asian world of men they be all interested in sex  one of the thing be that be find to be together whoc ae not marry can get into very deep trouble here  just a little food for thought  
sadly this have be the case for many year  maybe it originally stem from the day when arab have load of money  visit capital city  mainly in the west  and be naturally surround  a they be rich  by hooker  word spread when they return that they have be with western woman  the assumption would then be make that all western woman be loose  that be the assumption that we come to many year ago  rather like the western men go to thailand 
thanks dweller you have be fair  dg your point be sensible i tried to see if the shoe fit on the other foot and it same ironical    lol   it be a very rare western man that would want anything more than what you just describe  it be a very rare man in the west that want anything more to do with a asian girl than you just describe  its impossible to believe that the thousand of cripple shake 70 year old western men move with 21 year old asian beauty do so  because the guy be so romantic  love and responsible that the girl fell head over heals in love with him  i have see western men in various part of asia for the last 2 and a half year  trust me when i say if you do not want to get burn be very careful who you date  western opinion of asian woman be not very high when it come to sex and dating  here i actually mean woman from china  phillipines and thailand easy prey for western men in other country south asia and middle east woman be not availabl

hsbc loan interest  recently i hear that qcb have instruct to reduce the loan interest to 6  for the new and exist loan holder  any update on this i be hsbc customer and still they deduct same amount  any info from when this will effect and it be mandatory to all the banks  as i hear from my friend qnb already confirm they reduce the interest therefore loan repayment period have reduce  what a relief if this true     
advice and help hsbc s interest rate for personal loan dear ql member  it be very surprising that hsbc be still not reduce their personal loan interest rate while othe bank have be implement 5 0  1 5  loan policy a per qatar central banks regulation  as far a i know  hsbc should have recalculate personal loan  back and front calculation  abide the new qcb regulations  any idea on this  
i hope they  hsbc qatar  do it soon so even i can benefit from this 
as long a they do n t exceed the limit set by the central bank  they do n t have to  banks be there to earn money  sad but true  
just receive a mail from them last wednesday state that they be reduce the interest rate on my outstanding personal loan balance from nearly 12  to 5   round off figure   if that would be the case  there will be a significant reduction on the amortization that i be pay monthly  
tha s the problem  their existing interst rate still vary from 7  to 9 5   i agree that bank be ther to earn money and i share your view on that  but it be not human    
  mcdonalds3000 hsbc be tell this for three month now    action speak loud than word     
we ll see if they be true to their word once i check the amount that they will deduct from my salary this come salary  
 for bank to reduce their interest rate per qcb s circular  no ifs or buts  the qcb be the govern body of bank  wikipedia     the primary function of a central bank be to provide the nation s money supply  but more active duty include control interest rate  i e   price fixing   and act a a lender of last resort to the banking sector during time of financial crisis  e g   bailouts   it may also have supervisory power  intend to prevent bank and other financial institution from reckless or fraudulent behaviour  central bank in most developed nation be independent in that they operate under rule design to render them free from political interference    if your bank have not reduce it interest rate  then they fall under fraudalent behaviour   which would make them liable   
in my opinion hsbc have lot of hidden charges even if you go to customer service they could not even show or explain how they calculate their interest in front of you they only know how and when to deduct money from your salary  better change from hsbc  
be there a qcb circular number or any other reference number for this qcb regulation on interest rate  did it provide for retroactive implementation from time personal loan be take  
yes    there be a circular be issue 4 months ago  qcb be allow bank to charge a maximum interest of 5  per annum and it be a retroactive implementation where the loan shall be re calculated front and back  was plan to pay my remain loan and i learn to know that their computation will be base on the original interest rate when loan be take  in fact  loan agreement be base on float rate  this new interest rate be now be implement by other bank  except hsbc      
moving to qatar hsbc interest on loan hi  i m move to doha in april and i ve be try to research what the current interest rate be for vehicle and personal loan a i will more than likely be need a loan for a car whilst i be out there  i ve manage to find the commercial bank rate and qnb rate but i cant seem to find hsbc  does anyone know what it be please  i m look at borrow between 60  000  100  000 qr thanks 
i saw on today s paper a rate of 2 65  subject to term and condition of the bank  check hsbc com qa sale 
typically here the interest on vehicles be almost identical with small difference no more than 1 2 percentile  on personal loan  i be not sure but bank take time before issue them  banking here be different from the west  when you arrive to work here your company usually have facility with certain bank so you can only take facility from those bank  you can open in any bank a savings account but you will not get any facility with it   some of the large company can send your salary to any bank and then it be up to you to choose  note that vehicle loan tend to be straight forward a the bank co owns your vehicle until you pay your loan back however  personal loan take more time  at least a couple of month where your salary be transfer regularly  before it be approve  here  there be no credit history that you can transfer with you  it be all about where your salary get transfer and which company be sponsor you  bottom line  do n t bother with research any oth   
go to the bank and ask from them directly   
do you come to qatar for get a loan  
 you re an idiot  the first sentence say   i m move to doha in april      think before you post stupid comment   
just a caution  you ca n t get a loan on a used car  mandi 
best be doha bank  0  interest for car 
best be shoprite  they be give away car 
lets try to live within our mean  come on  just lead a simple easy life  earn  save  then spend  working class people who take loan for daily need be reason for resession in europe  keep away from banker  wish you prosperity    
you can get loan for used car also  if u get the car through any show room  they will arrange for the loan  just you need to sign the paper  but for used car interest rate will be little more  around 7

posb  post office saving bank ibsb  international blood sucking bank hsbc  high society bullshitting corporation 
lol    
 this topic have be widely cover in many previous thread  use the search engin to find several forum topic that treat this subject  the bottom line be  there be no such thing a   best bank    the concept of customer service and satisfaction be unknown  they be all sub standard  procedure and response time  light years away from western bank  choose from the name mention above  the most convenient for you to use   
the one and only best bank be qnb  in my 14 year of experience 
any idea about cbq   img nid 22259 title desc link none align right width 135 height 180  
avail the low interest rate for car loan  
well i think it s a rip off  no such thing a the best bank  i leave doha bank because of poor customer service and go to qnb which be happy with  with qnb  you have to have a minimum of qr 3  000 in your current account always  it s a compulsory saving scheme  plus  you get 25  in your saving account and if you take out a mortgage loan you pay 8 5   be careful  read the small print  i do n t trust bank here  
working in qatar what be the best bank in qatar  the best service  your experience  all aspect of manage  your experience with bank in qatar  some recommend  there be lot of bank but the best be  
cbq bank and ibq  
non so far they be all out to robe u out of our hard earn money btw cbq suck big time 
hsbc be the worst in this  qatar  country     i be in udbai  abn amro be good to care the customers 
cbq with no doubt  their range of service and their network be really convenient for customer add to this their accurate customer service  cbq be the best bank in qatar when it come to a number of service like online  call center   i also have account in qnb and i know quite well about doha bank  ibq do n t have online service at all  network  cbq be the bank that have the wide presence in mall  hyatt  villagio  city center  lulu hm  landmark  with all convenience this bring to customer in term of proximity and working hour  customer service in cbq be good than that of qnb and doha bank  i m not talk about people who smile only but about their accuracy and professionalism as well  they may be less flexible than other bank but for me personally i prefer their service over all other bank  and i have deal with many of them  
cbq have never let me down  on the other hand  hsbc  do n t go there 
cbq be the bad bank here in doha  have to teach them the meaning of customer service  even close an account with them be a nightmare  
all the bank suck big time in qatar  so no matter where you open the account end of the day it just same  i have go through all the bank and all of them more or less be same  
here go my rating  hsbc  good  low loan interest rate  no hidden charge  bad  slow and complicate service  harsh policy  cbq  good  premium service  especially customer care  www cbq com qa bad  higher interest than hsbc  few hidden charge around qr 20  30  month  
cbq be the best  i have account in qnb  standard chartered  doha bank  call center agent of cbq be really professional and very well trained staff  they have a excellent telephone manner  doha bank call center very poor  i always feel like i m not welcome to ask any question for what else i want to know  sometimes they need to transfer to another agent but i m not satisfy of their answer regard my problem  standard chartered bank be try too much to be the best but i m sorry to them they be very far from cbq call center  they register me to receive sm if ever any transaction make from my account  only one time i receive sm from them  qnb be one of the bad  i ve issue cheque for my car loan and i have agreement with the person responsible for my cheque but still it s nothing  what s funny with this guy  he act that he type something in the computer and promise it will not happen anymore  how disgusting   http  www lizaqat blogspot com 
undoubtedly it be doha bank par excellence and the bad commercial bank  
qatar living lounge increased interest rate on exsisting loan has anybody else notice this  i bank with doha bank and have a personal loan  i ve just realise that they have increase the interest rate by 2  sometime in the last 2 3 month without even bother to inform me  a phonecall to the bank have prove useless a usual  i m off to the bank now in person  let see what happen  i d be on the lookout if you do bank with them  
the same bank that be n t affect by the global financial crisis huh  
unless you have a fix rate loan  go figure  did you google it first  
just an update   i do have a fix rate loan apparently it mean nothing to them  i should feel good that this change be across the board  for everybody  new and exsisting loan   in case i felt leave out  i suppose   what be really amuse be how i be tell this be an international bank      and keep up with the market hence interest rate can go up and down  i do n t seem to recall them go down when the us dollar hit rock bottom    also regard not inform me about the increase  we have 1000 s of customer we ca n t tell everybody   i wish i could say they be save the environment by not send out letter but what s the excuse for not send an email or text  anyway long story short  i m move bank and be very glad to  good riddance to old rubbish  i do wish i could meet the people who give them all those award for excellence in bank  etc we must not be talk about the same doha bank  goodluck to all those who continue to bank with them  
you ca n t teach experience  
good lord  i m stunned speechless  that s some fine print for a fixed rate loan  i guess i m shocked but not surprised  mandi 
vegas  re read the post  nothing to do with late payment  just a general across the board increase in interest rate  basically the bank try to squeeze every penny out of people  especially those who have be pay on time  because this would mean they have the money  no use try to get money out of someone who do n t have it  to cover any loss they may have sustain while playing  the market  
same thing happen to me also i have a personell loan too with doha bank with out my knowledge they have deduct more interest this time  when i send email to them they reply say that they can not assist me i have to personelly visit the branch from where i have take loan  this be ridiculous  if they keep increase the interest rate like this i wont be able to pay off the loan at all and may be it will take very long time and moreover how can they charge u without any justification one fine morning they decide to charge 25  interest rate   
you d be well advise to stay away from hsbc  i have a catalogue of crapness from them  the late be   a fraudulent transaction on my credit card in december  they will charge interest on it anyway  i could n t believe it  i m sure their loan interest rate have go up too  i must find out 
i get an advice from hsbc that they be increase their interest rate by 2   
qs be that you in the car park wonder around look for a good rate lol          he who dares wins

 ok  thanks everybody that be very kind from all of you  best regard  nice weekend    if you re dream a love story let tear tell u about it    
good to read the positive comment about most bank  sort of revives my confidence in the bank here  i go to one and talk to the customer relationship officer  about open an account and to each one of my question  he have to guess an answer   any how  i guess only experience will tell                       quidquid latine dictum sit  altum sonatur  
hi casanova  i m sorry to disappoint you with this  hsbc be just like any other bank in doha  and it s even bad because they charge for every thing  do n t be amuse by this word  the world s local bank   they be right in it s local  but it s not universal  you can ask them about something to do with another hsbc world wide  they will tell you  sorry  there be no network between our bank in the world  so it s just local bank  i m tell you this  since i m deal with five different bank in qatar  and hsbc be even low level than others  it s just a big name  the only good thing about them  that they provide you park in the main branch in banks street  i think doha  almashreq  and the commercial bank be good option  best regard

moving to qatar  what can woman wear    my wife and i be move to qatar in october from the usa  texas  she be a bit concern on what be proper dress for woman  we have be tell that anything be fine as long a her sholders be covered and her knee  she be very upset about have to   cover up   when it 115  degree outside  what be acceptable   
 as a woman here in qatar  i encounter the same problem when i move here last year  i be tell   long sleeve and long skirt    that be not entirely true  esp  in the summer when the heat be unbearable  your wife can wear capri  knee do need to be cover  and short sleeved top as long a the neckline be n t too low  the benefit to long summer skirt be that they be actually cool than pant  the general rule be that it should n t be too tight or two revealing  also  keep in mind that they run the a c on high everywhere  so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeve when she be in restaurant  mall  etc  you be arrive in october  so the weather will be fine  like spring weather in the states  very pleasant actually  last winter it actually get quite cold here  so bring jacket and even a light weight winter coat  or heavy if you intend to travel during winter   one other option  a number of western woman do wear abaya aro    
surfcatgolferdude  cover up be not normal here for expatriate  cover shoulder and covered knee be not a must  let your wife relax  think of it here a a conservative western country  the rule be to protect herself in a way that she do not dress anything that could be very very reveal and tempt some horny guy to bother her  very trasparent trouser or shirt or blouse be not rcommended  very very short skirt be not recommend  welcome to doha 
i agree with kelly here  for expat  it alright to wear sleeveless  well  consider the weather here now  and skirts just don t show more skin than usual and of course  if you don t want to draw unnecessary look from guys lookers here  it be very intelligent to cover up you will see what we mean when you set foot here  basically  everything be acceptable as long a you do n t draw too much attention with what you wear  
 your wife can wear just about anything she want as long a it be decent  the muslim lady be totally cover up  co accord to islam  the beauty of the woman be for her man only  i recommend that she wear   normal   clothes  this be totally acceptable for   western lady    and at a club or at home anything  but when you go around to a supermarket or shopping mall i recommend she wear a little more covered up  this be not because of the islamic point of view  but more for her own protection  do n t forget  there be a lot of men here that do not have their wife with them  and sometimes their eye be fall out by look around   if you get what i mean aisha taweela  
like western men can wear full dress even in summer so why not woman  it islamic country and a per norm i would like to recommend you to come out fully covered thanks  welcome to qatar 
i prefer abaya if u need any help on abaya greeker be good at that he make nice design  d  img nid 21285 title desc link none align left width 180 height 180  
salam aisha taweela  just to correct you habibti  all the muslim woman be not totally cover up  a you say  did you mean shayla and niqab  there be thousand of muslim woman in qatar wear typical western clothing with head uncover  
greeker  our ql greeker  he make abaya   
ask him may be salam al massssssssssssssssssssssssss ta ta3ban shlonich   d qatari sorry    img nid 21285 title desc link none align left width 180 height 180  
and another thing  your post read a if muslim lady be not western  there be many western muslim woman here in qatar  and in the west    
doha shopping maternity clothes any advice on where to buy maternity clothes  so far  the few mall i ve look have either a terrible selection  i e  a selection of 3 different item  or the price be out of control  i m to the point of buy online and pay to ship  any idea   please  serious comment only  i m in no mood for sarcastic  silly  male humor this morning   
hi minoush  i think you probably try these shop already  ie  mothercare  mark and spencer  bhs  next  yup selection be awful  and price be ouch  have you try h  m  they do have many trouser  price range be 160 250qar  the other thing to do would be to invest in good pair of basic colour trouser and get your top stitch  
have n t try mothercare at cc  i hate go there but i may have to  m  s do not have a maternity section  i do n t get this  every local have at least 5 kid  plus every expat seem to be pregnant  where do they all shop for clothes  
i try h  m and their selection be ok  the only problem be the pant have this new fangled design where the waist be suppose to sit below your waist and it felt like my pant be about to fall down  just too hip and cool for me  i m old and i need mom jean     i will try bhs  i m use to target and discount store  the idea of pay  80   100 for a pair of pant that i will wear for 6 month be impossible  checked online  ship from motherhood maternity from the states be  70 for a ton of clothes  i think i will just do that   thanks lady   and thank you men for hold in your impossibly crude comment that you all love to make on every thread   
try babyshop and max in city center  thay have good collection 
hi minoush  you will have to go to mothercare at cc  because apparently all maternity wear from other mc shop be to shift to mc of cc  if not already there  you need to visit the mc inside debenhams  the local wear the abbaya  so a loose gown inside  the jalabiyas  more like the house maxi  be not visible to anybody  among asian clothes there be many loose top in style right now  with lycra tights  so again no problem there  getting t s be not an issue  as long a you be okay with it hug you tight all day  the trouser style  be the low bump style right now  and it doesnt really fall off h  m have the high waist trouser  not sure about baby shop for maternity clothes  else you may have to try the large clothes section  like evans  if you be look for comfy top  check giordano a well  they dont have maternity  but they usually have these loose comfy linen trouser that you can tie under the bump  
based on all our comment  a trip to city centre be on the card     you should find what you be look for in atleast one shop there  you can also check chico  
thanks all  yes a trip to cc will be in my near future  also  i think legging with long loose top  i know of a good tailor who can make some blouse for me  
if you want a bargain  try shopping at mr  price in hyatt plaze  prices range from 60 qar  100 qar  low price compare to the other brand shop  
make a rude  comment in here  i be hold myself since the start of the thread  many congrats  
i agree  pretty bad  even bad if you want to buy something for work  h m be fine if you be look for casual but that be it  bhs do not have a maternity section  i ask in the one in landmark  and mothercare be very expensive  perhaps order over the internet  
family life in qatar mothercare i m move to doha soon  and expect  is mothercare there the same a in the uk  so i should be able to buy everything i need at a reasonable price  i d be happy to find any decent alternative store too  thanks  
not only mothercare  but there be more similar shop where you can buy what ever you want 
the main one will be mothercare and babyshop  i have stumble upon a baby mother department in lulu supermarket hypermarket  which offer pretty good range of thing you need  let me know if you have anything in mind that you think you might not find it here in doha  so that you dont have to buy from uk  
yup mother care be here  so be baby shop which both be very good quality and stuff  
mothercare  babyshop  max  jameel  the wear house and many more you will discover more when you will arrive 
yes mothercare  elc  m  p  etc be here  but not reasonably price  you will see the price in pound and then the extortionate price in riyal  i only buy what i have to from here  everything else i bring over from the uk  
just to give you an idea  in m  s i pick up a pair of shoe for my little one  the price tag say 16 and qar150  
true say snessy you be right  i would buy everything from the uk they be definitely double the price and in some case triple 
i ve experience the same snessy  i get 1 piece of maternity blouse here for almost qr500  with the same amount  i be able to buy 4 to 5 pair in the phils  good quality  nicer design  some of their price be terrible  
just my 5 cent worth of opinion  not all the thing you need  you should buy abroad just because they be more expensive in doha  i wouldnt buy a baby cot and bring it over to doha  likewise for diaper  pampers   how many pack of pampers can you buy from abroad for a good one year supply  just because they might be cheap abroad  my opinion be you should consider buy thing  which be not in qatar  from your home country  even if you try to avoid pay more on baby stuff  you will eventually spend more on something else out here and at the same time pay less for other thing too  like car and petrol  
if you re ship a container over from the uk then my advise would be to bring e v e r y t h i n g and more   it s painful to pay 3 if not 4 time a you would back home  wipes be ripoff  i buy almost everything for my kid in the uk but my husband  aaargh  dissuade me from buy the next size up car seat for my son that would have cost me 110 120 from mothercare halfords but it cost 260 in mc here  needless to say i ll wait til januari when the inlaws be come   
qatari culture to wear a burqa or not  my family and i be new here  i pack lightly for my stay  with the intent to purchase a burqa for my outing  out of respect for the culture  however  i be surprised to find so many woman not wear them  is there a need as long a i be dressed conservatively  or be those not wear them be disrespectful and simply tolerate  
hi go a per what your mind say  
welcome to qatar  if you feel this be decent dress and more safer  you can wear  either muslim or not if you wear this dress  you will be respect  
i m shocked  you say you re already here  you do n t realise yet that qatar  sorrily  be a step away from dubai  or may be egypt  where you seldomly meet a woman with niqab  burqa  it s worthy to express gratitude for respect the land tradition  
not wear the burqa do not mean that we be be disrespectful  
wear anything that you feel comfortable but follow the qatar dress code  
lol  ca n t resist laugh at certain people s ignorance of the rest of the world  ps  by the way  in canada  not everybody live in an igloo   
you must wear a burqa always  
 tinkerbell  you say    if u r not a muslim u need not wear a burka   does this mean that muslimas need to wear a burka or hijab in qatar  during my short visit i get the impression that muslim or not  it s each individual s decision  or sometimes her family s or community s decision  and if no veil be choose  whether for the hair alone hijab or hair and face burka niqab  that modest dress be ok   
i know a muslim who do n t wear one  
happy horizons  you re absolutely correct  i ve never saw a burqa in qatar

qatar living lounge wearing thong  or flip flop just a question is it acceptable for men and woman to wear flip flop when walk around the street and in shop centre  or do we always have to wear closed shoe thanks 
flip flop be fine  as long a you have n t get minging foot  
lol this be a funny question  the local all wear sandal  every day  wear whatever you want  on your foot  
whatever you feel like wearing be okay  it s up to you     mo lang  
jandals be ileagal in my perfect world  
flip flop be ok  
the amount of leg  arm  cleavage chest seem to be of more importance than foot  
but consider the weather as well  i do n t wear flip flop during winter  
whatever you re most comfortable with  mind you in dubai i saw some people walk in the street in barefoot  
cool  thanks for your feedback  
haha ask by an aussie  if there be a place in the world where you could n t wear thong  i do n t think you d find any aussies in residence  if you re interested  apparently you can also buy vegemite and tim tams in doha  long live the aussie way of life  
socialising appropriate clothing for the beach and gym   hi all  are you able to clarify what be consider appropriate attire for female at the beach and gym  thanks  
swimwear at the beach and workout clothes at the gym  easy  really  unless of course it s a public beach and you do n t see any other female wear swimwear  then you should n t either  hotel beach be a safe bet  so be the remote area by the inland sea  
swim ware at the beach  bikini  tikinis  swimsuit etc  only at the privete beach  like hotel  and other club   not on public beach  like wakra beach  gym ware just a any other gym clothes           he who dares wins 
wats next   tea  with sugar or without gosh      
appropriate clothing for the beach long dress with slit  plus swimsuit underneath  for the gym jogging pant and long sleeve tee   
she s just ask for some info not to have problems issues  that s fair enough  regards    
ok 
my friend wear two piece swimsuit on private beach but never on a public beach  as for gym clothes  track pant and sweat shirt be good    
one advice never go topless not even in the dressing room infront of other female a this be see a utterly inappropriate           he who dares wins 
base on my observation  if it a public beach  wear decent   d if it s private resort or pool like the oasis resort  you can wear bikini like the mozza ive be see when i be there   d 
feel free to wear any workout clothes in the gym that you like  but you may want to remember to wear some sort of a cover up for shoulder  knee  bosom  go to and from the gym  mandi 
politics hijab  a burden to muslim woman  why only a few muslim woman wear hijab  why not others  is hijab make a woman outdated   plz share your comments  
i do n t think it s possible to make woman outdated  but hijab might be come outdated yes  
 in one word  choice    deaths in the bible  god  2  270  365 not include the victim of noah s flood  sodom and gomorrah  or the many plague  famine  fiery serpent  etc because no specific number be give  satan  10     
i hate that ad  it s such crap  
posted  discuss a billion trillion time   
infact the muslim woman wear hijab in the west be on the increase where a else where it decreasing i wonder why           he who dares wins 
 these be mostly the new reverts  maybe some sort of fresh eagerness to show their new identity    dgoodrebel will always be the rebellious good one    
 prophet muhammad  peace be upon him  say    avoid be naked  for with you be those who never leave you  the angels  except when you be relieve yourselves and when a man have intercourse with his wife  so observe modesty before them and honor them    al tirmidhi hadith 3115 narrated by abdullah ibn umar help people  the allah  god  will help you  
 i really dont think a piece of cloth can define a woman in the least  would some amazonian tribe feel some woman be burden by have their breast bind by a bra  i think this sort of question be only a mean to excite emotion     diplomacy be the art of say nice doggie  until you can find a rock  will rogers    
allah say in the holy quran chapter 33 surah ahzaab verse 59  o prophet  enjoin your wife and daughter  and the believing woman  that they should cast their outer garment over their person  it be expect that they will thus be recognize  and not molest  allah be oft forgiving  most merciful  allah say in the holy quran chapter 24 surah nur verse 31   o prophet  enjoin the believe woman to restrain their gaze and guard their modesty  and not to display their adornment except that which be display of itself  and to draw their veil over their bosom  and not to display their adornment except before their husband  their father  and also forbid them to stamp their foot on the ground l their hidden ornament should be display  allah say in the holy quran chapter 4 surah nisaa verse 103  indeed the salaat   prayer  be a prescribed  and obligagtory  duty that should be perform by the believer at  their  appoint time  in light of the above absolutely c   
it s their choice if they want it or not  
where can i buy cheap ticket go to dubai  me and my friend planning to go to uae this come eid  thats why im look for a cheap ticket  
advice and help cheap fare flight service to dubai  which be the cheap fare flight service from doha to dubai  pls tell me the round trip price also  i be plan to visit there with my family  thanks friend 
cheapest be the flydubai  u can call them on 44227350  
thanx sanity 
you might also want to check out rak airways to uae  with connect bus service to dubai   i have not try it yet but price seem resonable  
sanity be right  you should book your flight with them at least 5 day before your schedule visit so you could get the cheap rate  
the best one is air arabia to sharjah the cheapest of all and 25 minute drive to dxb 
in dxb on arrival visa cost 185 aed in sharjah its onlt 107 aed  
how about in abu dhabi  how much be the cost of visa upon arrival  
try flycamel airways 
sharja to dubai 25 minute  when at 3 in the morning  or be you talk of just the border  add an hour at least  
amadeo  sharjah to dubai be really just 25 minute travel by car if there be no traffic at the national paint area  traffic start from 7 to 9am and from 5 to 8pm during week day  there be a short cut to avoid traffic if the driver know it  but i do n t suggest the op to go for air arabia a it have only slight difference with the air ticket rate compare with the fly dubai  sometimes  flydubai be even cheap  if you dont have baggage to check in  and it be convenience to any mean of transportation  you can take bus  taxi or metro  
qatar living lounge visa for dubai for qatar rp holder i have hear that it   39  s really fun to drive from qatar to dubai on the weekend  obviosly if you have a 4 x 4 drive   my question be do i need to get a visa if i want to go to dubai if i have a residence permit of qatar  
although you can go to dubai and get visa on arrival if you be go by air but road travel be different  you have to pass saudi border and you need saudi visa  in order to get saudi visa you have to get uae visa first  saudi give visa only after you already have uae visa on your passport  hope this clarifies  
the whole process will take you 8 day  3 day to get uae visa and 5 day to get saudi transit visa  count the weekend 
holly molly      i would drop the idea of drive to dubai in that case  i should go drive in qatar for 8 hour rather  atleast i do n t have to go into the hassle of get visa but  thanks guy for information  
think twice before do this  it be at least 8 hour drive  at 140 160 km h   
the drive through saudi be say to be dangerous also unless you be that adventourous  it easy and safe to catch the flight and get visa on arrival 
drive through saudi be not dangerous  the road be absolutely normal  just keep away from truck  the only problem be total lack of gas station  however a it have be tell here  it be not fun  and the only reason to do so be probably shop in ikea  
driving to uae be a lot cheap than fly  you save on air fare  specially if there be more than one person travel  and then on taxi in uae  do what u think be best but it be not dangerous inside saudi  it be just a normal highway  
highway be normal  i think now it a 2 lane track  there be a few petrol station when you cross the saudi border from doha  after that the next station be around 150 km away  
well for uae visa you will have to go 3 time to the embassy  but for saudi transit visa just go to the agent and you will get it stamp in 5days  
if you look at old map  there be a land route connect qatar with uae  what happen to it  well  one day the saudi decide they would take it over  and do so  murder some qatari border guard in the process  http  www arab de arabinfo qatar government htm when i live in oman  the same sort of thing happen to a piece of land border the uae  which be why oman be split in two piece  
visas and permits fly dubai and on arrival visa im a medical specialist by profession and qatar resident travel with my wife and baby to dubai  will i and my family get on arrival visa in dubai  is it true that fly dubai wont allow u to board the flight from doha a we dont have a pre arrange visa  i have already book fly dubai ticket for all u online  what should be my next step  waiting for answer from experienced traveller  thank you  
i dont know if your profession qualifies for a visa on arrival but there be no problem fly with fly dubai and take a visa on arrival  i have be to dubai last month with my wife and have no problem get a visa on arrival  
you will get on arrival visa without any question  just you need pay there 155 dirhems for each  fill up the form regard info about ur stay in dubai   you can enter dubai  
yes they may deny you entry depend on your profession  i be rudely deny check in by airport staff  they do not believe that i be allow a visa upon arrival in dubai  have to buy last minute ticket from qa which cost a fortune  long story short  i be give visa upon arrival and i email the admin of flydubai about the incident  nothing happen to my compaint  hope this help 
a straight answer on this site  lol 
nothing to worry  if your profession be eligible for a gcc on arrival visa fly dubai wont stop you  its pretty easy to get the visa in dubai  
you must need to complete 6 month to qualify yourself to get the on arrival visa  the resident permit should show that you be a professional like engineer  accountant  manager  doctor etc

fly dubai really suck  their airport staff seem to have no clue about dubai immegration procedure and can easily ban any passenger from board  the airport counter have no supervisor to talk to  in case of any conflict and their main office staff be worse in cooperation  i have a similar situation where they do not allow me to board a my rp have only 2 5 month expiry date  i purchase a tick on qatar airways and get an arrival visa at dubai without any problem  fly dubai be not convince and they seem do not want to listen and escape from pay back the ticket cost  i desided to use a good repute carrier even with double or tripple ticket fare rather than face such irresponsible situation at the last moment  
thanks heap for the replies i feel that if our profession be allow on arrival visa in dubai  then rest depends on our ability to convince the airport staff in doha

qatar living lounge qatar airways prices i see the price for qatar airway be stupidly high again  and almost 40  more than emirate  when will they come down again before the summer  or will they continue to rise  obvioulsy qatar airway now think they can charge stupid price a they be the best 5  airline in economy   
a couple of week ago they be low for flight til the end of the year  but now they ve suddenly jump up again  very annoy  but it s not just qr that do this  all airline do  do n t make it personal  
i be pay almost the same price to go doh bkk on qr a my girlfriend be pay to fly bos bkk  on ua  to meet me  sigh  mandi 
i use to praise a lot to my colleague and friend abotu qatar airways flight and claim to be much good than any other flight in the world  but no more  not that qa stop it quality service  but if you draw a price quality graph on various airline  it be not so great  what be the big deal to have good quality  to give 40  more         they shuld give the quality a an after sales product for the same price   or for a slight high price  
bear in mind that direct flight will usually be more than non direct one  that s why some qr flight be more costly  e g  qr uk   doha   uk be normally more expensive than ba uk   doha uk  with ba stop in bahrain for an hour   
yep  and flight inbound in term of the carrier base be usually cheap than flight outbound  for instance  if you be travel from dubai to doha  emirates flight will be more expensive than qatar airways  
i m gon na hold off and see what happen a i do n t travel until aug  but then ramadanis soon after that    so who know  you ca n t teach experience  
cheap airline cheap staff and third class service the cabin crew look like sweeper crew and their service be rubbish compare to emirate so why be they increase their price        everyone know that the money they get to run their airline come from oil and gas  
so have etihad not like this qatar airways 5 star rating wonder how much money they must have give under the table for the 5 star maybe five big one  
 qatar airways must have to   buy   their award for service  it certainly be n t base on the real world from anyone i ve talk to  or on my own experience   signature line    you ca n t fix stupid    
i like qatar airways

family life in qatar bahrain or dubai  just find out that i need to fly out this weekend and come back  my application for family visa be deny because my husband be travel at the moment  so which airport do i choose  i ll be travel with 2 young child  
oops i mean between dubai and bahrain  
choose the one with cheap airfare if you be just go to return from the airport  bahrain airport be much small than dubai so you can get in and out quickly  that be the only difference i can think of  
bahrain be well with small child  be a small airport  dubai be a giant airport even for just transfer sake  
bahrain 
i m look to book a flight that arrive in bahrain at 9 h30 and departs at 9h35  is that cut it short  i ve be to dubai airport and i agree it s huge  but never be to bahrain  
you expect to catch the next flight in 5 min  let me know how that go  p 
i take the visa run with 5 child and i book an hour layover between flight  we be bore  but i do think you need about 30 minute at least  5 minute be impossible  
my thought exactly  but why would they offer that if it s not feasible  i m panic i do n t want to spend my day in an airport  
depends how young your child be  there be absolutely nothing for them to do at the bahrain airport  they might have a bit more fun at the dubai one  
i would recommend dubai or sharjah coz incase your visa have not come atleast u cant stay in the airport for long 
what be the best bank in doha  i m look for a bank that have  possibly free  online check and saving  offer around 5  interest on saving account and have a positive track record with transfer fund quickly to out of country bank  any suggestion  if you have experience with all three  feel free to post up  thanks

although they do n t have the satisfactory customer service level  i will still recommend them a it s pure islamic services  i  personally  do n t accept the idea of islamic service from a commercial bank  
customer service at safa be rather good  it be particularly suit to ppl who receive their salary at qcb but want to save the islamic way  easy cash tranfer  
my dad be in bank all his life and think it just an eyewash    its just the same commercial banking label islamic  he think we be all fool to follow it so blindly  any comment

advice and help which bank to use in qatar  hi does anyone have recommendation for which bank to use in qatar  the account will be use to get my salary pay into and transfer fund overseas  thanks 
i use to use cbq when i first get here  but i be n t happy with the service and product  now i use qnb and it fairly ok  but when it come to send money back home  cbq still offer good exchange rate  
doha bank ltd be mostly prefer by the salary class  
no worry bank  qnb  be with the royals                   
cbq be the good option 
most of the bank here provide good service to the salaried class and i hardly see much difference among them  you should select a bank where your company have a bank account a it will allow your salary get credit to your account very quickly each month  
agree with acchabaccha  go with the same bank a your company  unless you plan to take out a loan in the near future  then go with the bank that you re most likely to get the best loan offer from  
cbq  
thanks for the feedback guy  will find out which bank my company bank with and go with that 
good luck  caramel  super input by acchabaccha  acchabaccha mean lovely baby   
lol  thanks 
moving to qatar personal loan and work termination i be currently work here in qatar  our employer inform u that they will transfer to contractor with less salary  but we have option not to accept  but the problem be i have personal loan in one of the bank here in doha  what if i will not accept the offer  what will happen to me  i mean do the bank will force to pay or not  
haha  so you want to get away without pay the loan  
not really  but iam just curious what if the company be the cause of termination  
yes  but your loan and contract be with the bank  
you mean even the cause of termination be the company  the bank will force me to pay   and wat if i find new job with less salary war will happen do they reduce my monthly fee  
i be sure you can renegotiate the repayment with the bank  
ah okay  because i be just worry  but not pay and run from my debt be not my option  i do believe in karma  thanks for the info  
you re welcome  i hope it all work out for you  
fact  if your company terminate you  take that letter to your bank  you wo n t be require to pay any remain amount  bank will use it tact  do n t yield  after few day of delay  finally you will get clearance from bank and fly home  insurer of your money  bank would pay that amount to bank  may be insurer and bank be have office in the same building  or manager be cousin  they be after your money  so escape clear from both party  pray hard  good luck in find another job soon somewhere  regards  
would you believe if i say 1000 have leave without repay a single coin in case your company terminate you  what for you pay premium every month my friend  
this be interesting  i do not know this  to be honest  i be surprised that this be possible  but good for those who have bank loan

yes you can change your sponsor and yes you can change your company a there be no contract aggrement  
you can change once they agree and give you noc 
no you ca n t change your sponsorship unless they will give you noc 
noc be worthless a you can not change sponsor within one year  
i be an hr manager  since you have not yet print your visa  you have to leave the country and they new company will recruit you on a new visa  no noc required   but do not make finger print  since they can make a rp for you  but what you be do be a horrible thing since the company bring you from your country on their own expense and then you decide that you want to find another job  which be relatively easy here   well it none of my business  but good luck 
ahhhh  cyberdiver have a point  your rp have not be process therefore you do not have a sponsor yet  therefore i think you have be work illegally here for the duration  
hi if your passport be not stamp with your rp  you be free to change without any fear  only thing be that you may loose your settlement payment  but you must get a job  with a company who have visa for you  you can always go out and come back with a new business visa provide by the new company  please check out visa availability be qatar be strict about visa for a few country national

unless ur visa be not print on passport  u can easily change a sposor  no need of noc   many people do not know this procedure and stick with the job  the only thing be that they may charge ur flight  visa exp  from ur settlement  i slightly differ with mr  hr manager  u can protect the employer s interest by penalize the guy the money they spend for employ these people  many unlucky guy land here with bad employer without fulfillig promise and unsuitable working environment which may compell them to leave  so let them leave and search for something they they feel good  
hi  this be not fair with your company now unless they do n t give you the agree salary  just make sure your passport be with you  
visas and permits husband visa not allow to resign  what to do  my wife in my sponsorship  husband visa   currently work in a company here in qatar  but she decide to resign  and her employee  owner of the company  do n t want to allow her to resign  they say they will sue u and we will meet in the court  is this possible  if ever my wife sign a contract to them and not yet finish  can they really sue her  if ever  anyone know a lawyer to help u  thanks  
one question  have this company issue a wirk permit for your wife  
dear   are you in same company  if no  did you get approval for you wife to work in qatar  if you get approval  your wife can resign with 1 month notice  as per qatar labor law  any of party  employee or employer  can terminate the employment contract with 1 month notice  if you do not get approval from moi for work  your wife be illegally work and the company also do the same if hire somebody without approval from moi  in this case company be not go to go to court since they be also do illegal practice  so do n t worry both case your wife can resign   
they say they will issue  but after 1 year there be no permit copy up to now  i think they be not able to get a permit  
send me your mobile number and i will call you  i be work a hr offficer and mandoob a weel  let me have a c lear view of your story 
sristakdas  who should get the work permit  be this should be process by me or the company where she will work  but her company ask for my noc to allow my wife to work  they say they will process a work permit  but i do n t know if do  since there be no copy yet give to my wife  i let my wife finish the 1 month notice to leave the company  thanks  
sristakdas be certainly correct  the company can never ever sue your wife   hire somebody on family visa without work permit be illegal this will cause penalty for the company we have family visa work with u  husband visa  and i apply work permit for them because of the fear of it circumstance  if ever your wife have work permit  she can still resign by give the company 1month notice  do n t worry your company s wife will never win this game  no company can resist resignation of their staff but it is the obligation of the staff to give the company 1 3 month notice  
nayhr  in this case you can sue a company  they have no right to allow your wife to work without the work permit  it be a comapny s obligation to secure the work permit for your wife  they be violate a law  and also be threaten you  
work permit is being applied by the company to whom your wife will be work  this cost 500qr for 1year and after all this procedures  ministry of labor will issue work permit id that your wife must be bring during work hour in the company a a basis that your wife be work legally in that company  
it is everybody s right to resign if ever you be not satisfy with your work provide you give the required notice period   resignation do not need any approval from the management resignation do not need any approval from the management 
as per what i know from your post they be try to threaten you  if they be able to get the work permit she can give one month notice and if they do n t have a work permit work till the end of the month get the salary and stop work  they will sue you on what basis  
salary and allowances after resignation benifits as per qatar law i am working in qatar on last 6 years  my present salary 5000 qr  i would like to resign from my job and settle back to my nativ country  can u please advise me what kind of benefits i can expect according to qatar labor law   is it company can give the gratuity together with monthly salary is it allow by the law here  if i go legal action against company any use   please advise 
qatar labor law be make to protect the interest of expats work in qatar min you can get 21 day vacation per year  21 day gratuity per year of year worked min should be one year of service  
a lot of people get screw on this  remember that although 1 year of work be the minimum period to be able to receive this benefit  you get pay pro rata for any period exceed the first year  include portion of a year  
 you re require to provide 1 month notice before you resign so you call get all your benefit  i think at least 75  of your salary x year of service be your gratuity plus all your vacation leave  etc  im not sure though but most probably it s go to be like that  i have a question my self  it be relate here though i already post it to question  answer but it seem no one be really visit that part of ql so  my company get this habit of delay people from the date of resignation so they obviously know about the two week max limit of qatar labor code s article 57  my question would be  be there a law regard my company be liable or give me a just compensation start from the day i terminate my contract to the day i go back to my home country if they   accidentally   delay me for one or two day up   
every company be liable to give 21 day annual vacation and 21 day indemnity gratuity minimum upon completion of one year  some company to avoid this terminate the staff in 11 month  and others mostly dont pay anything to the ignorant labor and junior staff that they dont get their right  you can approach the human right department and the labor department who help the expat in such case   cupid s  any resignation or termination should serve a month notice except if you be terminate in your probation period  first 6 month usually   also employee who have complete 5 year or more need to serve 2 month notice  the company be liable to pay only the notice period  the pending vacation balance if any and the indemnity calculate on the last earned basic salary  hope this help 
go to labor court 
if those employer do not go by labour court  they can be blacklist  
ishu369  the 1 month notice be for the op for me can my company delay me without them be liable because i already file my resignation  expect to leave on the day i terminate my contract so if they delay me for 3 day be they require to pay me  because some employes in my company be delay for more than two week without get pay though they ve get the say benefit  i do n t want to get stick here for a few day so if they can be hold responsible they ll be force to do their job correctly  if there s any  
very frankly say  do n t think about legal action  it will never work  gratuity per year be of 21 day  so if you do n t take it previously  you will get all your due  try to find a median solution  insha allah everything will be fine 
gratuity be pay  21 day per year which be calculate on your last basic salary  in your case u say that you be work for the last 6 year here in qatar with a gross salary of qr 5000 month  so let u assume your date of joining be january 01  2004 and your basic salary be qr 4000  if so  the calculation be a follow  01 01 2004 to 31 12 2011  21x8  168 days so your gratuity be calculate a  4000x168x12 365  qr 22  093 15 apart from this  your employer should provide a ticket to your home country  the notice period up to 5 five year from the date of joining be 1 month and above that  2 month  in your case the notice period be 2 month  gratuity indemnity be settle net of any staff receivables recoveries  
if the company be issue your ticket then they can delay it till there be a cheap ticket or an affordable price which be common with some company  they pay you only till the last date of your work a per the resignation or cancellation of contract

working in qatar resign or leave   best option  i be employ in a semi govt organization here in qatar  i have just get permanent immigration approval for canada from india  can someone advice  if i should resign and then go or i take one or two month leave to go to canada and seek job opportunity  suppose if find good prospect  can i send resignation by email 
 you could as a courtesy email them  there be nothing they could do about it  be there  i ca n t see them send people to canada to drag you back  take the 2 month leave    deaths in the bible  god  2  270  365 not include the victim of noah s flood  sodom and gomorrah  or the many plague  famine  fiery serpent  etc because no specific number be give  satan  10     
since in my contract one month notice period be require  so in that case  if i find canada lucrative in term of job  salary  then in what manner should i resign from qatar job   
 i resign and i will be stay in canada    deaths in the bible  god  2  270  365 not include the victim of noah s flood  sodom and gomorrah  or the many plague  famine  fiery serpent  etc because no specific number be give  satan  10     
a agree  take the 2 month vacation and try to find something high pay  if you find something  just email them say you be sorry but due to personal reason you can not return  they probably wo n t be happy about it  but at that time you would have another job so it wo n t be like they can keep you from find something   what difference do it make to the dead whether the mad destruction be work under the name of totalitarianism or democracy  gandhi  
do the honorable thing  resign  
 there be only 50  chance that you may   find a lucrative job in canada      i have a friend wrking in qp  who get canadian visa  a year back  he do a wise step  he take one month off  take all his family there  to stay with his friend  also to study the job market  living condition etc he be back in qp  he say he may cancel his canadian visa  even thugh he lose financially not everythng greener on the other side  my friend   
very well say birdie    there be people on this site who may tell different story to you  but please take birdie s word  take a wise decision  everything s gon na be alright    
heloo2020  chances of you get a job there now be very slim  i don t think you will immediately adjust to the country  it take year when thing go right  but at the moment life be n t easy there  high unemployment and huge tax load   if you have a family to take care of  perhaps it would be wiser not to take risk when you have little chance to succeed  take leave  do n t disclose the reason to your employer  and go there to assess personally the situation  good luck  
i be a little hesitant whether to express my thought  becaue it may be discourage statement for helooo2020  for indians  get a canadaian visa be like somethig like jackpot  it be no more  yes  for your chidrens education and the social securiy scheme be all excellent my husband friend  mr j  still continue in qp  he have no repentance of cancelign his canadian visa  may be he have see the ugly picture  which normally we dont imagine 
i have see numerous case of people get canadian visa and have no intention to work there  they base their family there and continue work in the gulf with high package  because of the new passport   so  it all come down to what your real intention be  i would go with baldricl s suggestion that you do the honourable thing and resign  perhaps you could get a commitment from your employer that he would consider take you back in six month time if need  good luck anyway   
working in qatar probation period hi guys  i get a job offer from qatar and the probation period be for three month  if for any reason i dont like the company or the job  can i leave my job  i need some advise from the expert out here  thanks 
no  if you do n t like your job you have to stay here until they release you  no such thing a resigning  and they will chain you to your desk if they even suspect you want to resign  
lol fatcat  d ahhahahah  if you re look for a problem  you re probably gon na find one  
of course you can leave the company  but before they will issue your rp under thier sponsorship  fc  no sponosorship  no need release    and it s good idea to make sure you like the company before they finalize your rp process  
be correct  both party be on probation with each other  
try to get more  more information about your job and company  this will help u to decide  
during probation period either party can terminate the contract  
same problem  my reason be  long working hour  no day off  do i need to give a good reason to not to continue my work  i ve be work for 15 day already for my 3 month probation period  3 year contract  and i be unhappy with my job  what be a good reason to tell to my employer  what if he will not allow me to stop  i have my medical exam last tuesday  08 12 2008  and i need to go back on monday for finger printing  i think  to complete the iqama  anyway  i m direct hired  i really want to go home  please advise  
what about the worker s right  
i know  
foine69 if you want to go home you can just resign  no need to give any reason  simply resign and go back home  
moving to qatar personal loan and work termination i be currently work here in qatar  our employer inform u that they will transfer to contractor with less salary  but we have option not to accept  but the problem be i have personal loan in one of the bank here in doha  what if i will not accept the offer  what will happen to me  i mean do the bank will force to pay or not  
haha  so you want to get away without pay the loan  
not really  but iam just curious what if the company be the cause of termination  
yes  but your loan and contract be with the bank  
you mean even the cause of termination be the company  the bank will force me to pay   and wat if i find new job with less salary war will happen do they reduce my monthly fee  
i be sure you can renegotiate the repayment with the bank  
ah okay  because i be just worry  but not pay and run from my debt be not my option  i do believe in karma  thanks for the info  
you re welcome  i hope it all work out for you  
fact  if your company terminate you  take that letter to your bank  you wo n t be require to pay any remain amount  bank will use it tact  do n t yield  after few day of delay  finally you will get clearance from bank and fly home  insurer of your money  bank would pay that amount to bank  may be insurer and bank be have office in the same building  or manager be cousin  they be after your money  so escape clear from both party  pray hard  good luck in find another job soon somewhere  regards  
would you believe if i say 1000 have leave without repay a single coin in case your company terminate you  what for you pay premium every month my friend  
this be interesting  i do not know this  to be honest  i be surprised that this be possible  but good for those who have bank loan  
working in qatar  revoked job offer in doha  hello  i just accept a job offer from a post production company almost 2 week ago  however  this new employer advise me   not to resign from my work yet   and to wait for their go signal  but they still ask for employment requirement from me  like passport  education document  etc  what could be the reason why i could n t resign yet  is there a chance that they would revoke my job offer  based on what reason  thanks a lot   
to be on the safe side so that u dont loose both the job so just be patient and wait and dont resign until u get the new offer letter 
it s about visa  
it s weird because they even ask me to email them a signed copy of the contract  already sign by their hr manager  what reason be there for them to revoke the offer  deny work visa  failure in background check  
only ur new employer can tell ya the exact reason 
a job offer or a job can be revoke at any time even without warn you not to resign   so do n t worry unduly  
ok  it s just a first for me  thanks everyone  
the reason they ask you to wait be that they might not be able to get visa approval for our nationality  so they might give you the offer  but they can not provide you the visa to come here  so just wait for their go ahead before you resign from your current job  
all contract here on contingent on you qualify for a work visa  if you do n t qualify  you do n t have a valid contract  
   but they still ask for employment requirement from me  like passport  education document  etc    read more  http  www qatarliving com node 4414366  have you do your medical  do n t resign until they say that your good to go  its not easy to get your job back once you resign   
hey guy  just wan na update you  they give already a go signal for me to resign  take about a month since the employment offer    
hotels in bangkok so the question be easy  what hotel would you recommend to stay in to avoid in bangkok  thanks 
sightseeing and tourist attraction package holiday  where to go to  hiya  be it possible to find good package holiday deal in doha  and what location would be suitable for a restful  quiet beach holiday  not too expensive and let say 6 hour of travel max in september october  
thailand  check out emirates and qatar airways package  but it s 7 hour to bangkok  mandi 
well  plus minus 6 hour  7 be n t so long after all   hmm  might be a good idea  just so many place to choose from and so many to avoid if one do n t want mass tourism  party and girl  what about the rain season  
thailand have two coast and two rainy season  if it s dry in phuket it s rain in koh samui and vice versa  if you choose the right resort hotel location you wo n t get mass of tourist or the bar girl scene  i really like thailand  go myself in three week  because it s so darn inexpensive  i plan to feast and sleep for next to nothing  my hotel in bangkok and siem reap be about  40 night  i have stay in the 5 star place  peninsula  shangri la  but i know these little boutique place and they be just fine for my girlfriend from the us and myself  it s a chick  holiday  and there be the cutest and tasty thai restaurant available that i swear have good food than the big hotel  mandi 
hmm  that sound like the right holiday for me  give me a little cabin somewhere  get out of bed at a certain time  read in the hammock or another cozy place  off to some breadfast  back in the hammock  roll into the sea for snorkel or swimming  back relaxing  go for a little walk look at animal or plant  back relaxing  maybe a little half day excursion once in a while but nothing too long  and a simple dinner somewhere in the evening  perfect relax  i definitely do n t need a luxurious huge resort  hmm  if we decide for thailand  can i contact you for accommodation advice  
that sound like me in koh samui  try tripadvisor com or fodors com and read their hotel review and their forum on thailand  kinda like ql  mandi

qatar living lounge passport while travel  where do you keep your passport during a holiday trip  do you keep it in the hotel room locker or you carry it with you  i normally carry it with me in my handbag  been to far east few time it be safe with me  but two of my friend recently lose their passport  one in bangkok from their hotel room and one in malaysia from their backpack  i just want to know what do you all normally do  
i deposit it in my safe locker in the bank  back home  but when i travel in some other country  most of the hotel have a safe deposit locker in room  so i keep it there  
what it have to do qatar living    i deposit with reception where possible or the safe locker in the room  forgot the pas key once for safe locker   
back home  just in our personal safety box  while travel  hotel  safety deposit section  though there s one time that i have them all in my bag all together  losing one s passport be a hell of inconvenience  
myself always carry along with me never try keep it in the hotel room locker 
i remember a time when we do n t have a safety box yet back home  i forget where i put the passport and it be the day before our flight back to doha  i be so worried and dead sweating when suddenly my baby open his school bag and take our passport out  my baby take it from the cabinet and put in his bag   whew  what a relief  
when travel to other country  i keep my passport safe in my locked suitcase in the hotel room 
it best to carry with yrself rather than to keep it in hotel room or locker 
yes bm  lose your passport be a nightmare my friend have to go back to india and wait for three week to get his new passport and visa do to come back here  that s why i be worried  as khanan said i be also think of deposit it at the hotel reception  even if they pickpocket our money  card  we can somehow get back here  but without passport we will be strand there  
wife purse be the safe place  a the makeup in purse will be more valuable than the passport she will never let it go  
it will be more comfortable to keep it with you but be safe to keep in the locker

i go to thailand for 3 week at christmas new year and visit a few different place  but if you only have 5 day then you ll probably only be able to do one place  bangkok be probably your best bet a i expect that s where you re fly to from  and it have plenty to do for 5 day  the lonely planet have plenty of good suggestion of what to do  but i can give you more specific idea if you want  we also go to chiang mai in the north which be lovely  still a city with lot to see in and around it  but it seem to have a far more chilled vibe than bangkok  if you fancy proper chill then i d recommend down south  we stay on the andaman coast at khao lak and ko lanta  north and south of phuket respectively   both have a nice relaxed atmosphere  not as manic a i m lead to believe phuket be  
am go to do a train trip from hanoi to ho chi ming  it will take about one day but i read about it and look ok for me  also be plan to go to some beach in thai but i need more info in order to not miss those amazing place  am learn the basic thing of the language too  the venezuelan sensation

advice and help thailand trip dear friends please advice me how to proceed with thailand trip  iam planning to stay for 5 day with my wife and daugther  if i pay online to any of the hotel to reserve any problem in cheat  please advice 
i book all my hotel on line and have for the last 10 year without problem  just go to a reputable site  http  www asiarooms com  www booking com these be 2 i use regularly  make sure that when you enter credit card detail the site name start with http s                            anything else you d like me to google for you   o  
if you reserve online to a recognize site then it be perferctly safe  i ve do this for over 10 year without any problem  thailand be very safe 
yes both of them be right  i live in there and so i know  i can help with you if you need any suggestion  ban spoon feeding not me 
use the above sit or asia web direct website  search on google  to find our info on the hotel you would like to stay at  these site usually have a great line up of hotel and their basic rate with facility available include their picture  once you have identify the hotel you would like to stay in  search for the hotel name on google and book the room from the hotel website  majority of hotel offer best rate available in the market thru their own website  makes sense a they save on commission or brokerage charge from third party website             3000 ql points way to go ray             
i once stay in hong kong  book online  i have to return to the same hotel unexpectedly a week later  their wlak in rate be almost double  however they suggest book online  we go to the hotel s own internet cafe and make the booking from there and save a fortune                           anything else you d like me to google for you   o  
i ve use www latestays com a lot of time  never have any problem with them and you can get instant confirmation  
thailand be very big  can any one suggest the best and cheap hotel  30 usd day  which have beach with tide  swim pool  near to airport  with good facility  and enjoyable  
http  www tourismthailand org  
rayzz  most hotel definitely do not offer the best rate through their own website  it s nearly always cheap to go through another website  a couple for the list  www expedia com www travelocity com 
i would recommend novotel siam square if you go to bangkok  the place be in the centre and walk distance to near bts

sightseeing and tourist attraction best place in thailand for vacation hi  i be a single guy and be plan to spend 3 week in thailand around christmas  i have never be there before  i scuba dive and travel a fair amount  any suggestion of where to go and what to do  thx 
places to avoid  pattaya phucket chiang mai all sleeze and not a lot more  
pi pi island 
phuket  phataya beach  pi pi island   super wonder place  been there once  also try to see the float market  
hua hin 
massage parlors  
phuket  go there this august 9   
tell me     i hear that the scuba be good off of phuket   like all you have to do be get a good place to stay   and that there be plenty of dive shop and boat   tour    
you will love pattaya so much when it come to night life and the night market at patpong in bangkok  
i believe the scuba around hua hin be n t so great  my favorite travel site for thailand be the fodor s thailand forum  www fodors com  click on forums then thailand  search for scuba  i would say phuket be a good place to start  or koh samui  mandi 
but be to some other place  and whenever i plan to go to one place i always check it first in tripadvisor  http  www tripadvisor com tourism g293915 thailand vacations html check it out and have a wonderful time on your trip  
sightseeing and tourist attraction massage parlour does anyone have any experience at any massage parlour in doha  where   39  s the best place for gent   39  s massage and what   39  s the range of the price like  massage for men be all do by men  i   39  ve see mushroom number of gents saloons in qatar   do they normally offer massage service or just hair cut  
i think saloons usually  if they be of the 1950s barber look they offer a head massage  shave and haircut for 15 20 qr  albeit i have never have the full tratment myself so cant advise which one  there be so many anyway  what be the deal with them call them saloon  did they think a salon be for woman and since they have see  western  film  i e  cowboy one  with men go into saloons that be the male name equivelant    and everyone else have follow suit since  nice man saloon  pretty saloon  and my favourite boeuty  something like that  saloon  the last one would be a good name for a strpiclub cum nightclub  about massage parlour  i think most of them be men2men but there be a few exception check with the major hotel

space      lool y dont you try dubai   i v hear hotels  other accomodations have go cheap coz of recession  iam sure  5k be enough  
sharjah  al ain  ras al khaimah  oman  by car   iran  by boat   
well you can go to dubai  if you dont than go for umrah  makkah   it the best option   cheers    
yes omar be right  if u r muslim u can go for umraah  it best option u can also visit some place there 
you cant travel far enough with your money    it not just enough frankly  asea cost you already 4000 fare  make it more like 10000 
how many day u want to spend and also tell me ur nationality and i will assist you on the same  regards  anwar 
sri lanka be a beautiful place to visit  if you go to srilankan airlines office that be at al saad  you will be able to find some package for qr 5000  include airfare   and if you plan on go there choose july a that be the off peak season there and hotel rate be donw by at least 50   i be there last year  the mid and south region of sl be quite safe  unlike the north  
y dont u get to bangkok it a beautiful city every thing be cheap there except the ticket make ur money at least 6 or 7 thousand and u can have great journey there for 4 to 8 day 
check the travel agency they have promo so u will enjoy and i recommend malaysia be nice place and cheap also even food s  and the second option if ur muslim u can go makkah for umrah u can visit also different place in saudia  
why not try somewhere totally exotic in south east asia  thailand  vietnam  or malaysia caters from the 5 star to budget traveller  air fare with qatar airways be approx qr3  000 to thailand  you may find cheap fare with gulf air  leave you qr 2  000 for hotel etc  take a look at air asia s web site  it be se asia s budget airline and can fly you cheaply and connect you to nearby neighbouring country and have many hotel price list too  if time be not an issue you can also take the bus from say malaysia to thailand  or thailand to vietnam or cambodia  best of luck

qatar living lounge money or son  whom should a mother choose  when it come to decide between money or son  
if she choose money over her son  she be no longer a mother to the son  how could any mother want money over her own child  what a horrible position this be  
what a question      of course the son  money come and go  you can make it and loose it and make it again but your son be special  unique and forever  create your own destiny  fight against your dark side  raise your spirituality every day be a new day a new life  keep the faith   
 how much money and how old be that son    i fight with love and i laugh with rage  you have to live light enough to see the humor and long enough to see some change    ani difranco  
nothing can replace my son  i know my son be a pain and a monster  but nothing in this world can replace him  not now and not later  not for any amount of money  but then again  it be just my opinion  
novi  i agree with you 100   well say  
 be he a pain and a monster before he make you see fantastic four     even a stopped clock give the right time twice a day    withnail  i  
you good come and see me and after that it will be a son for mother to care about   img nid 21285 title desc link none align left width 180 height 180  
i think your son need you more than need money specially if he be still small the best thing can make any mother be to take care from her child and keep husband to work and earn money  this my advice    
lol  he be a pain in everything  probably you can call it a single child syndrome   i always do alot of thing with him  once he do not get his own way  that would be the end of the world for him  btw  have you see that movie  
   novi  i agree with you 100   well say       thank you for agree

qatar living lounge expat wife in qatar hi everyone  very nice to meet you all    my wife and i be move to doha in about 3 week  as i m go to be work most day  my wife and i be a little concerned about what she ll be able to do to keep her occupied during the day  we be think of get her enrol at an esl school  she do n t speak much english   besides take course  what do other non expat spouse do to keep busy  thanks everyone  hope to meet some of you after we arrive  
hi  nice to meet you  hope your move go well  it can be difficult find thing to occupy your time here  especially when you re new  i m not sure where you re go to be live  i live in an apartment block with my husband and it have no communal area so have find it hard to meet and get to know my neighbour  i think compound life be a bit more sociable  anyway  a couple of idea  the intercontinental hotel  the one near katara  not intercont  the city  have a special offer on tuesdays and wednesdays  lady pay only 50 qr to access their pool  pool area  i take yoga class with yama yoga http  yamayogastudios com  they be lovely and might be another way to meet people  also  not sure what nationality  language your wife speaks but there be a number of association for different nationality here  buy a copy of marhaba magazine when you arrive  they have an up to date list of them with contact detail  so she could socialise with people who speak her language  
absolutely i agree with rubsty 
if she know cook etc  she can make delicious dish and snack  also she can learn many language through online it be free  she can improve her english through online study  if she know paint or tailor she can earn bite extra money by do  if she have do any beautifican course she can join in any of the parlour  if she be find animal she can give some food and water to the street cat or bird  if you need a marhaba magazine i will give you a copy  best of luck and a pleasant stay in qatar  
sounds like a great title for a low budget film  o  
hello  i guess it all depend on what kind of person your wife be  maybe she like to exercise then she can go to aerobics class n stuff  she can do yoga or she can even go to ezdan and get a package or sth for gym and swim pool and stuff  and it also depend where you re stayig  she can even sign up for a website  ql let s say  where she can learn stuff abt the country and news about the country  and she can make friend maybe  she can visit the musuems here when she come but after some time what i metionned be pretty much all  hope she like it here   
why this world be not fair  why expat husband be n t get pms with tel  no    liked your new prof  pic   
just give her your credit card and she ll find more than one way to keep herself busy    
i ve be here only 2 week and i be absolutely bore out of my mind  my compound be very small and be desert  remind me of a western flic  without the tumbleweed  where be she from  she can hang out with me i ll teach her english  kathy

what do you miss  what would you load up on  hi  getting ready for the move over and i be wonder if anyone have any tip on thing you really can not get in doha that at home  be just readily available  someone mention cough syrup and tampon  anything esle  
welcome to qatar i be get miss cals from 224 55201665 i be get mi cals from 224 55201665 and other number but when i try to call no reply can any body tell me be it any scam call or what  any one else face this problem    what to do kindly help me  
you re get miss call from an international number you do n t recognize and you call it back  why  if the caller really want to contact you  they will call back  
actually to day i get same miss call from same type of number but it s a different number like 22355686969  but i know it s from my country bangladesh  because that time i call my country than i understand some time all number not come  and some time all number come but before come 22 like  so it s not to worry   
the only thing i can tell you be that someone from guinea be miss calling you  as far a i know there be multiple case where someone miss calls and you call back and then your phone load be go or you get charge a lot if you have a subscription  but as far a i know  now there be security measure in place to prevent this from happen  but that do n t mean that they do not happen anyway   just be careful and do n t call back  send an email to qtel or vodafone and tell them about your problem  normally they should be able to help  block the phone number from call again   i m not sure but i think you can also do that from your phone  
i also find this  http  www pluggd in getting calls 224 missed call spam 297  223 it appear to be us canada  
i also find this  http  www pluggd in getting calls 224 missed call spam 297  223 it appear to be mali  
why you be answer strange number   even more it be international number  and why give you miss call anyway  this number from guinea  and it be mobile number 
it be a scam  i have have call from 224   239  370  best advice be that if you dont recognise the number  do n t answer the call and do n t call back or text  
are you crazy to call back an unknown number  do you know someone to call from that country code  have you hear about sim cloning  if they want to talk to you they will call again  it could be a trap  there be lot of mafia who be do cloning of sim card and use it for illegal purpose  if you call back your sim could get clone and will be use by them for illegal activity which could lead you to great trouble  if you be get miss call from unknow number just ignore it for be safe  
that s a phone call scam from american state of illinois or from the country of guinea  http  en wikipedia org wiki area http  countrycode org guinea 
 i hear that when you call to those mobile number all your data save in the phone can access to the other party  it another scam method so dont call back them    if you be important for somebody the call will come gain  dont go behind ugly dog who do n t care about you

moving to qatar al khor dear all  i will be move to qatar with my family quite soon  i will be work in ras laffan and have be offer housing in al khor  can anyone tell me something about al khor a a place to live with family  2 kid age 4 and 6   how about schooling  facility  entertainment  living condition and environment  can my wife easily find a job in al khor  is al khor a nice place to live or should i insist on accommodation in doha  kr van 
i do n t know much about alkhor bu i think it will be good if you stay in doha especially that you have kid and they need to go to a nice school which i doubt you will find a nice one in alkhor  ayman 
hi ayman  is daily commute from doha to ras laffan feasible and be there accommodation to be find in the northern area of doha  wv 
i think you will find that the housing in al khor be first class and that the schooling  english  be of a very good standard 
al khor be a nice quaint little town  and it have a beautiful corniche 
the ras laffan housing complex in al khor be quite good  if that be where your staying   there be a nice beach there too  however  it be an extremely small town and really only use for the oil and gas industry  you would probably find your self come to doha on the weekend  see if you can stay in doha a it be only a 30 to 40min commute in the morning  
there be some nice compound in the northern area of doha that could be withing your requirments and budget  it will be good to read the following post and send me the information  http  www qatarliving com qatar forum forums are you looking for accomodation or any help to settle down in qatar ayman 
hi  i m go to move to alkhor soon  a i ve be offer a job with qatargas  can you please tell me what be it like for single  many thanks 
the school in al khor be good  well equipped and have a happy staff  in fact everything for the expat community be well equipped and there s a very nice club with a lot of social activity  besides lot of home partying  neverthless  it have a sleepy feel which can irritate and some of the teen  i gather  get a bit disgruntled  playing the single game might be tricky  imagine a very orderly english suburb with no pub and a 60 minute drive to the near bar or off licence  but with plenty of dance class and bridge tournament and stuff  many people love it  some ca n t stand it  
interesting comment mr niceguy  how far away be al khor from the doha  what about housing  be they affordable  what be the name of the school  is that the only school or be there any other school within commute distance  many thanks 
prices  i do n t know  all the foreigner i know in al khor live in the community   a large compound between al khor proper and ras lafan which have one school  and one social club etc  i have think housing and club membership be provide by the various employer  it s about 40 minute drive from the north end of doha to al khor  warning  i do n t live there  though i have visit and have pal there  
socialising would you tell anyone your problem  if they say that we be not suppose to tell anyone our problem  include our best friend and relative  because 20  of people around you do n t care about it and the remain 80  be happy that you have  would you still tell them your problem  
a problem share be a problem halve  
yes  of course but with select few only  those whom i would trust  
sharing be care and friend and love once will care about you 
i try to solve most of my problem  others i leave it to god  
if it s not too personal  maybe it would help if you d share it with your friend because sometimes share thing that bother you take some load off your shoulder   
in general  sharing problem and get solution be great  it be easy to share  but not easy to find the right person to share  even the best friend may not give you the right solution  you be lucky if you find the perfect person to share  then do not hesitate to open up your heart  good luck  
no i dont tell anyone my problem i just take a blue pill    
i would tell those people i trust  it may not solve the problem but it surely will help me release some of the tension i feel inside    
eye  i may not be able to solve your problem but i be a great listener  
never use to but have start recently and it do help  
advice and help what do you tell to your wife  what do you tell to your wife when she call you at work  i kind of irritated sometimes because i do n t even have anything to tell her other than  1  hey how you do 2  do you eat something before go to work 3  how s work 4  i will be home before 7 00 pm 5  what do you want for dinner this keep go and go  can you please give me any idea what s the best thing to tell her to make her happy  
a job 
first of all you be lucky  you get a chance to talk   once you ask the above 5 question  she would take half a day to answer  next  ask or discus about her parent  brother  friend  hobby  next vacation plan  car  check what she passionate about   never end list  once you get  where she be more intrested in then you emphasis more on that topic  hope this assist you 
may i ask why do you get irriated   everyday be a new day  with new answer to the same question  it should be excite a when she call  it give you to take a break from work  get to know what she be upto  above all  like victor say  be glad she call  else  a aussie say  get her a job    
jonald  consider her also a a friend  your confusion will be clear  
 be thankful  she could ignore you and not bother     if you do n t like the heat  get out of the kitchen  but stop try to fan the flame before you leave  it will burn you on the a  a you go through the doorway     me visit www qaws org  
i agree  consider her a friend and not be irritate   or maybe to catch her off guard  you call her once in a while to show her now much you appreciate her  maybe she need more attention    so something unexpected  like buy her flower  or take her out shopping   
well say xena  
what do you tell to your wife  honey  how do you like another two carat diamond ring           that s all    
azam  what be you on about  i miss the part where i tell somebody to shut up  and i be not ajamille  read again    
your not take good care of your wife maybe too much work  she miss the care man in you so when she be call that s mean she s call to hear a loving warm word  try to give her 5 min from your long working day

 totally agree with   smoke    
hi  canadian luda moving to qatar in mid august be a no no but if you have no choice  why do i say that   because the weather be awful but once you get to oct nov  you will enjoy it  regarding the shipment  there be no point in do that since the company will provide you with a fully furnish appartment villa you will find everything here  house holds  china  etc  at a reasonable price  visa it depends on how fast the company you will be work for be  what to expect when you arrive   hhhmm  difficult question a lot of dust  heat and a lot of humidity   i do n t know how much you know about qatar but if you have any question just let me know  cheers 
 1  furnished apartment be equip with all kitchen stuff  such a dish  pan and pot  glass  etc  bed have bedding on them  no need to bring any home stuff  unless it s some dear to your heart items  2  expect   upside down   life  just forget everything you know and whatever you get use to  be ready to learn and accept  and yeah  if you drive  good take couple of lesson with the driver from f1  it will help you drive here  trust me   you become responsible forever for what you have tamed   antoine de saint exup ry  
tough time to move  i move in august as well  but atleast you can comfort yourself in know you re hit the bad weather by that time and it only positive from then on  quick addition  i do suggest you actually move with stuff  especially if you and your partner be do this together  clothing be expensive here and if it s just your own stuff  that you want around the house  pack a few box of clothes you want  pic  music or book or whatever  everything retail and consumable be expensive  as for a move company   i ve use crown relocations on all of my last 3 move between country and they be top notch in every place  visa stuff  let the employer take be of that  i can recommend that you have at minimum 2 certify and original of all legal document  birth cert  marriage cert  etc    it be easy if you need them later on than have to wait to obtain them  plus  if you can even get one of each certify by the qatar consulate in canada before you go  yo   
yeah  clothes for sure  push into your luggage everything you can   you become responsible forever for what you have tamed   antoine de saint exup ry

dracula  how do u know that line  that s from my facebook account and on my profile  do i know you  
socialising hindi fm radio in qatar theres no hindi fm radio in qatar like 89 1 or 101 6 uae channel  any one have an idea to set it up here  i think ql itself can try  
you can get thousand of fm station from your satellite dish  
u still in stone age      
 what do u mean   set it up here  i think ql itself can try     can anyone set up a radio station just like that    
do n t just limit the indian crowd to ql  formatted soul  hell  who s talk of indian alone  when it come to hindi music  i bet there be score of pakistani  bangladeshi  sri lankans and even arab who simply love it  music be a unifying bond of all asian  a hindi fm channel in the line of dubai s channel would be a sure success here  or even a channel that play different language at different time of the day  what say  ppl  take care raakhee 
blabla  be take about hindi channel  for your info this be not an asians only site  we do listen to western music and hip hop  but i really wonder how many westerner listen to hindi music  a channel with mixture of different language music might be a good idea  
 img nid 103941 title desc link none align left width height 0  nil illegitimi carborundum 
yup  u ve get a point there about westerner not listen to asian music  but the channel be not go to cater only to ql member  y see it s for the entire country  think of all those construction worker out there  a vast majority of whom be asian  who could plug their ear with a pair of earphone connect to their mobile  i m sure almost all mobile today have an inbuilt fm system  and work  they have no penchant for english music a many of them do not understand the language listening to music from their country will definitely make them feel a wee bit less homesick at least  and for all those people from the west  there s always qbs     take care raakhee 
it would be awesome if we have our own hindi channel  i be a pakistani but i love hindi movie and music  i do listen to radio 4 fm 89 1 and city fm 101 6 but we do not get them all year round  only when the weather be calm and not windy  we do n t get it all during the winter  it be a very good suggestion and i do believe qatar should have it own 24 hour hindi fm channel  if we can have 24 hour english channel on fm 97 5 for the last 30 plus year in qatar then why not a hindi channel     
thanks a lot for that  be it clear enough  what be the frequency  i ll tune it today itself   take care raakhee 
even pakistani song simply rock  string  atif  jal and the like   take care raakhee 
advice and help why asian guy ca n t get white girl why do you think you only see s asian girl with white guy and never asian guy with white girl  why asian girl go for white guy  and it so rare to see the other way around  be it becuase asian guy be too shy  or be it about size and height  or maybe you guy have answer to all my question  i just wana know myself coz im not an asian girl  
please specify which asian group you be talk about  oriental  sub continent or arab  i feel your scorn and i accept it jon stewart 
from what i ve see it s usually because of money  
its nothin to do with size n look  it sure do with the money  also i believe communication problem be there  usually u find the asian with good accent  i m talkin a in majority n minority  also these white chick be a bit expensive to keep  well but it be common  i have one before  infact i believe they be easy catch  well guy dont get me wrong here  but i m tellin you this from my experience  
easier catch   expensive to keep   whew  i wish you could have be more subtle here  nobody be a good catch   buddy  if you find someone who reciprocate your feeling  the question of be expensive doesnt arise  chances be  one wouldnt let the other bear everything on their own  isnt that the basic principle of love  care and share  or have i lose it and become too old already  
hi imz u talk a if u r a swinger dude western female be unreliable and secondly they be like that use  throw sort of sh t no value   thats why when it come to an asian man he have a high value for a woman of any descent 
 ok  qatari  i volunteer to start the group name   stupid stereotypes and generalizations    so  instead of have these retarded post every 3 day  we ll just have a group and everyone can go there and free up the board for more important thing like cell phone ad and salary question   
sputnik  that wasnt in good taste  and that post be bad  with a capital b   
how many asian guy do you see over here  sheer weight of number  i would think  ok but my fiancee think it because the asian girl here be more westernised and therefore would have more in common with them  also there be alot of asian girls date asian guys here  perhaps you just do n t see them  trust me she be korean and would know the number  perhaps you do n t notice an asian asian couple but notice an asian white match more because it stick in your brain  i have see load of fillipino couples out together  and i be tell that fillipino girl would much rather go out with fillipino boy here a they have more in common and be not just trated a sex object which we know many arab guy do  
 wrong  it should be   why asian guys dun go for white girl     
you can answer the question of which asian group you think much more applicable  wheter oriental  sub continent or arab

qatar living lounge how old baby can travel qatar airway  hi qlrs  could u pls advice  after how many week a new born baby can travel outside qatar via qatarairways and do the baby need visa to come qatar again after few month  
are you sure you do n t mean water airways  i know of that one but not watar airways                       2500 ql points  way to go ray                         http  www e4u name qa main htm 
so to answer the question  i m not certain if you be inquire about airlines policy or government visa policy   if it the former  best thing to do be call qatar airways and ask them  if it s the latter  then maybe there s a government agency you can ask  when my daughter be bear  here in doha   she do n t travel till she be 6 month old  but we be tell the law be that she have to have a residency visa within a month of be bear  so by the time she travel she have it  hope that help somewhat  and good luck  stay safe all  perfection do not exist  the question therefore  be  what level of imperfection be we willing to settle for  
just make the new passport n make the iqama on it than u can travel anythime u want  if u put his her name in mother passport than u can travel also but dont forget to make ammendment in mother iqama  kid ammendment thanks if it solve ur problem 
for the visa  good get it before the travel to avoid furture hassle  but i would suggest that you let the baby grow old a few month more before you take him her travel on an airplane  just imagine even an adult do have some problms with air pressure inside the cabin of an aircraft  what more would a few week old or a month old baby feel about this   he she ll be cry all the way to your destination  if that s the case  
my son first travel at 4 mths  as soon a he get his rp  make sure you ready with bottle of milk for feed during take off and land because infant have a sensitive ear and the change air pressure in the cabin make the baby uncomfortable  
when he travel for the first time   as per doctor s advice and a novita say  i give him a bottle of milk during take off and land  and everything be ok  just make sure to issue him passport and stamp the ikama  rp  on it before you travel  
hi all thanks for ur valuable comment     
i buy my baby girl when she be three week old  she be now healthy and fine  i normaly assume the baby can travel after two week from qatar airway  you have to fee baby during take off and land to avoid pressure diffrence  and should keep your hand clean  by wet wipe  before you touch the baby to avoid contamination  visa can be obtain on arrival for the baby  
most airline policy allow travel for infant from two week old  
what be easy to admister  get a new passport for new born baby or put her name on mother passport  and please advise on the requirement and procedure in put the baby s name on passport 
moving to qatar personal loan and work termination i be currently work here in qatar  our employer inform u that they will transfer to contractor with less salary  but we have option not to accept  but the problem be i have personal loan in one of the bank here in doha  what if i will not accept the offer  what will happen to me  i mean do the bank will force to pay or not  
haha  so you want to get away without pay the loan  
not really  but iam just curious what if the company be the cause of termination  
yes  but your loan and contract be with the bank  
you mean even the cause of termination be the company  the bank will force me to pay   and wat if i find new job with less salary war will happen do they reduce my monthly fee  
i be sure you can renegotiate the repayment with the bank  
ah okay  because i be just worry  but not pay and run from my debt be not my option  i do believe in karma  thanks for the info  
you re welcome  i hope it all work out for you  
fact  if your company terminate you  take that letter to your bank  you wo n t be require to pay any remain amount  bank will use it tact  do n t yield  after few day of delay  finally you will get clearance from bank and fly home  insurer of your money  bank would pay that amount to bank  may be insurer and bank be have office in the same building  or manager be cousin  they be after your money  so escape clear from both party  pray hard  good luck in find another job soon somewhere  regards  
would you believe if i say 1000 have leave without repay a single coin in case your company terminate you  what for you pay premium every month my friend  
this be interesting  i do not know this  to be honest  i be surprised that this be possible  but good for those who have bank loan

i be tell by some us visitor when they come to lebanon that their own state department tell them to say they be candians if anyone ask lol  but in qatar it should n t be an issue richard123  stay safe all  perfection do not exist  the question therefore  be  what level of imperfection be we willing to settle for

i be just mention to jinkz because i think it be funny   stay safe  perfection do not exist  the question therefore  be  what level of imperfection be we willing to settle for  
what i know qatar be ok  just curious though  what i know they do not stamp the passport there   live your life as simple a you be  money do n t create man  but it be the man who create money  do n t do what others say  just listen to them  but do what you feel good

good about dubai  i say there may be  problem not there will be  and their policy must have change  http  www lonelyplanet com thorntree thread jspa  threadid 381160  tstart 0 israel stamp stigma some country will deny access if you have a stamp of israel in your passport  in the me they be  iran  lebanon  saudi  arabia  syria  uae and yemen  there be report s  accord to the late me lp  that some people have have no problem while have visit israel  but do n t count on it  oman deny entry to israeli national  israel borderguards do n t stamp my passport can i go now to syria over land  no because the syrians can tell that you have be in israel by the entry stamp you ve get at the jordan bordercrossing  can i travel to israel and syria over land use two passport s  no because then you ll have one passport with an entry stamp from jordan and an exit stamp in your other passport   offcourse the syrians will notice that and it be also the question if jordan want   
who would go to israel anyway   it s the only country i would say that i will never travel to   
sightseeing and tourist attraction do i need to renew my passport now  my pp expire on 25th may  final  and i wish to go for a short vacation in 9th april and return on 25th april  do i need to get my pas renew before i travel  
yes  you must have at least six month validity on your passport in order to enter qatar  
no need to renew now u can after u come doha  but in case of resedent u cant go if there be six month to expir  
a mandi say  you need to have 6 mths validity in order to travel anywhere in the world  not only qatar   
u can renew ur passport at ur country  
if u want to travel to other country not ur home country so u have 2 renew both  
you have a lot of time to renew your pp  just go to your embassy here in qatar  
most country require you to have at least 6 month remain on your passport before they will allow you to enter  i have the same problem a you whilst live in panama  i be a resident there but with a uk passport  i be go on a 2 day business trip to mexico and have to renew my passport before i leave panama  therefore  if you live here but do not have a qatari passport  you will require to renew your passport before you leave for your trip  
i dont think it be necessary to have 6 month validity while you hold a valid residence permit  6 month validity of a pp be require if you be travel to a country without have a valid visa for that country and you will not get a visa if you do not have 6 month valid passport as well  in this case i would suggest you to renew your passport before you go on leave a you do not have too many day leave  you be plan to come back at the end of april and in case if you be not able to travel your passport will get expired and you will be in trouble  so play safe  
you need to renew it 
if you have valid rp and you have embassy here in qatar  you can go and come back in situation you wrote i be sorry mandi  here i dont agree with you  first time entry  must need minimum 6 month validity  you can travel to your country  without break down journy  with expired passport but can not enter with expired passport   even some country dont allow transit pax with limited valid pp or expire one   
visas and permits exit permits hello everyone  i be come to doha soon from south africa and i beleive that once i be there i need an exit permit to leave  do anyone know what this mean  can i visit dubai without an exit permit   i know i cant come to south africa with out a permit     
your big problem be you have a south african passport my friend be in the same boat  if you be on a business visa then the answer be yes if you want to leave the country you have to have a exit visa if you be on a visit visa then no you do not but you will need a visa to get into dubai  
you only need an exit permit once you have get a residence permit  rp   the exit permit be give to you by your rp sponsor  it can be issue per trip  however  i advise you to get a one year multi exit  
i think i be go on a work visa a the company i be go to be sort my visa out  so be there place i can go or be i stick in doha  
getinandstayin sorry to say but it be not only on a residence permit but also a business visa  so it really depend on if kelly be come over to work or to play so to say  
the company i be go to say i can only get one exit permit a year  be that correct or be it for them to decide  
so you will be on a business visa until your rp come through all you have to do be tell your company when you be go and they will apply for a exit visa which be just a piece of paper really say you be allow to go and they will also get you the entrance visa for when you come back  you can go wher you like just remember to check if you need a visa for the other country you wish to visit  also make sure they have do your business visa before you fly out so it be sort for when you land  
well too late to back out  look like i will just have to stay there  was actually want to work and play  looks like i will just be work   surely it cant be bad a you make it sound  i feel like i be go to go into a prison  
no on a business visa you can fly out as many time a you wish so that just might be a company thing iam on a business visa and so be three of my friend one be a south african like yourself and we fly out for weekend all the time  it could be because it be a pain in the bum and alot of paper work for them that they be say only one exit  but if you have an emergency they you be also allow 
who be you come to work for  
i be start to wonder  a the company i be go to be also sort out my visa  good idea or bad idea  you have be very helpful  thanks 
salary and allowances rant for the day why be salary base on passport here  why why why why why why why why  if 2 people do the same work and 1 be even willing to work on weekend yet he be underpaid because of his passport why why why why  damn the racism   
because the sky be high   
well see  the thing be  that some people assume that western people have a good education and work ethic  the problem be  that a lot of non western people have western passport  go to canada  get a passport and come back here  many people go that route to get a good salary  
the light the skin the high the pay  rofl    
start apply atleast a canadian passport before travel to gulf country for a job  
it s all to do with cost of living in home countries  
brit  i might have to disagree with you on this one  cost of living in home country  i can assure you that in india  some people have a really high cost of living  like anywhere else  you can get very similar foods item for very cheap or very expensive  depends on how rich you be and on your lifestyle  average living standard and governmental service vary between a 3rd world country and europe but that be it  plus  if someone be live here  who care how much a soda can cost back home  why ca n t that person mr  kumar  enjoy his weekend in qatar like mr  john  do with his family  i bet you mr kumar s kid and wife would like to have gourmet food every once in a while  i be glad i be white  but nothing piss me off more than racism and especially when it get acknowledge by those who benefit from it    you know good brit  
also be  have work in hr here for a while  it be common practise for company to ask what your current salary be and they will base their offer on that  for instance  2 civil engineers  one from the us and one from philippines you will find that the one from the philppines will be on say 8000qar and maybe the one from the state will be on 21qar  in their home country   hr will base their offer on how much extra  or not  they can get away with offer above what they currently earn  so you ca n t give someone who be on 8kqar currently over 20k and similarly you can not offer someone who be on 21k less than that because he think  why would i want to come here for less than i be currently earn at home  also back to be s point  rent  mortgage general cost of living in india and philippines be much less than it be in most of europe and north america  and lastly for those that say why not hire all from india etc because there be nothing more detrimental to a good company than hir   
what be we here for but to save for a good life when we go home  if someone can not save for a good life when they go home  will simply not come in the first place and company have slowly realise that hire all from one nation do not work  so they have to pay more for a mix of people  however  what i have notice be that people from say india who have live in the me a while  their salary do start to become more equitable a they change job  base on their current salary and each time they change  voila  their salary go up  what i also notice be that alot of westerner  their salary do not change much  they be already be pay the top for what they be do and can not get much high by change job  
ok   criously without any reserved sentiment for any nationality whatsoever  in truth it depend all on your passport   it s obvious just take a look at your passport  then your counrty ok   sigh  now take a deep breath and realise the way your re be treat in your own country and compare with the numerous country you envy  compare the salary and again the benefit   the answer be clear  if we re be treat like sh t where we come from you d be treat the same way any where  now take my advise   change your passport by any mean to qualify for the competition and or go back home  fight to make it a good place and make your kid proud  o 
i second that    yeah brit could do good

moving to qatar letter of invitaion qatar embassy philippines hello guy  can anyone tell me what kind of letter of invitation that they need in qatar embassy philippines  because my mother go there and they do n t approve my mother s visa cause they need a letter of invitation from the sponsor or affidavit of support why they need those document even i m the sponsor of my mother  if ever i ll make a letter of invitation do the airport immigration in philippines will grant it   thanks  
go to the philippine embassy here in doha they already have the format just pay 100qar if im not mistaken

i totally agree with mylyn and aleks  
the letter of invitation require by the embassy of qatar for visa authentication be different from the affidavit of support require by philippine immigration  the letter of invitation be a simple letter from the sponsor indicating that he be a resident of qatar and be invite the visa holder to come and visit qatar  
hi  just make a letter to the addressee indicate the purpose of the visit and that you will take care of the need of the visitor preferably in company letter head  for direct relative usually affidavit of support from the embassy here be not need but for assurance you may want to get one  send her these letter  your pp  qid  employment certificate and rt ticket and she will be fine  that be provide your mom be not more than 60 year old  good luck  
thank you so much

i be offload last sept  30  2012 at naia immigration my visa be a business visit visa applied bought for me by my prospective employer in qatar it be valid from july 2012 to october 2012  1 month   now  i already have a workvisa sent to me by my prospective qatari employer through email which they bought applied from qatar ministry of interior  i m plan to travel to singapore a a tourist first then proceed to qatar  what would i need to do  do i need to go to qatar embassy in singapore and have it stamp  or just buy a ticket and go  i have inquire at philippine overseas employment agency and they tell me the requirement for me to be hire directly by my qatari employer  one of the requirement be the employment contract which be need first to be authenticate by phil  embassy in qatar  but unfortunately  my prospective qatari employer refuse to abide by this procedure and instead  they send me the above mention new workvisa  they also adviced me instead to travel first   
you may also need you and your mother authenticate nso birth certificate and let her red ribboned it at our department of foreign affairs so that it can also be a proof to the naia that you be truly related to each other a mother son  you really need a salary certificate too and send it to your mother in order to prove to the naia immigration officer that you can support your mother s financial expense such a food  transportation  housing and other miscellaneous expense while she be in qatar  
how much do bottled water cost  i would like to find out how much the high end bottle water cost in qatar  i need to find out the average cost of water from a supermarket or other venue  and only the high end bottle water  like evian  therfore  it should be the most expensive  and perferably in a glass bottle  if possible  thank you  
health and fitness which water company is most clean in qatar    rayan  nestle or manhal     hey  i want to make water delivery subscribtion to my house   i dont really know which water companyis most clean in qatar    rayan  nestle or manhal     
i dont know which one be the cleanest but i m use safa  
we be use manhal no complains in fact it doesnt matter which brand you go for becos all the company must maintain the standard here so doesnt matter just go fo any brand 
rayyan be the best    
there be two type of water natural mineral bottled drink water  go for natural choice rayyan great test value for your money  or try massafi  
manhal and nestle a the best  safa doesnt taste like mineral water a all  delivery for manhal and nestle be the best  ive be use for years  
rayyan only 
they all must meet strict standard of hygiene with bottled water  the choice be personal  dependent of your taste and budget  some high price water taste foul and some of the cheap one  rayyan  aqua gulf  be good value  
it s all clean  if it be n t they d soon be out of business  
cleanest be giant s mineral water    
i would suggest that you boil the tap water and use for drinking or run the tap water through a filtration process system such a aqua guard or brittanica  agents be here in doha who would give you a demonstration and i understand the system cost you around 2000riyals but you have the liberty to pay in installment  but i have see the demonstration and you would see the difference what a tap water or mineral water  any brand  offer  the result be amazing and be sure that you would forget all this mineral water and opt for this system  unfortunately i dont ahve th no  of these filtration company agent personnel number  whenever i get it  i shall surely post it  cheer bob

al manhal water factory co  ltd  wll  tel  4603332  
rayyan claim to be the only company in qatar who supply 5 gallon mineral water  
yeah sabeel be the best supplier and also the water taste well  i have try manhal before  sorry to say  bad service and the water be just like any other tap water  i try few other water like aqua cool and safa  not so great  rayyan be an exception but little too expensive  anyways i be happy with sabeel and dont intend to change even if they increase their price  so i strongly recommend sabeel water  tel no 4606980 contact their sale manager by the name anil  very helpful  he will set up a service for you  and dont forget to give my name a ref  a i will get two free bottle  just kidding  
nestle be very good and reliable  ph 4503332  
al jazeera pure drinking water be also the best  their container be all new  their service staff be polite  they have a timely delivery so you wont worry wether you re out or still have spare container leave not consume  they will only replenish your empty container  no more to hurry for call them at time you have water shortage  besides  they be offer one  1  free stand water cooler dispenser for free upon your first time availment of buy 2 booklet water coupon  at a cost of qar1100 00 for 200pcs 5 gallon bottle  it s worth more than a service and the pure healthy water  i just have avail of it two week ago  i have a new cooler dispenser now  call them at tel  4509555 fax  4509444 or email them at  info  aljazeerawater com for more query  simply call anwar hussain with mobile  6191064 for additional info  i highly recommend al jazeera water for you  
i would not totally agree with sajaryan say that almanhal be like tap water  it one of the best but i do agree that sabeel be good  co we have the brand in our office and it distibuted by international water co w l l 
not nestle water  although their water taste good  their service be horrible  plus  they be at least 2 4 riyal more expensive per bottle than other company  
yes  hukk be right  nestle be not good with their service  infact  i come to know that manhal and nestle belongs to the same group  manhal do the filling for nestle  no wonder why they have such lousy service  to answer mr vengal  i dont agree that manhal be the best  if u r use a dispenser with their bottle  you will be surprise to see red color plastic piece inside the water tank and at time it be visible in your glass too when you pour the water out from the faucet  thats coz the red cap what they use on their bottle be not spill proof  when u put the bottle upside down on your dispenser  the cap get puncture and blow into piece and it end up in your water  i guess only rayyan and sabeel us spill proof cap  and hence it safe  
too bad you guy havent find nestle reliable  ive be use them for 8 month and they have never fail  infact a couple of time id forgotten to take the bottle out and wasnt home  a they ususally knock if you dont leave the bottle out  and ive rang them and they hav come the next day to deliver  i guess everyone have different experiences  
qatar living lounge aqua gulf pure drinking water  contaminated i have two sample of aqua gulf water contaminate  if this be the way we can never have mineral water bottle  why to pay and buy poisonous water

 i have no idea what they use shabza  be just try to cure plushed s coffee addiction by plant seed of doubt in her mind  p   live with passion  die with style    
why do you say it contaminate   do you carry out an analysis and conclude that it be poisonous  
basically all the mineral mention in the bottle be clearly visible like synthetic contaminant  or some heavy dirt  when buy bottled water  consider something that s good for u and good for u than drink something else  i have keep 2 bottle a sample to determine the level of contaminant in aqua gulf bottle water  request water test result from any company or individual who can provide and we can inform the necessary authority to ban this brand in qatar  
to expose the mineral water scandal well do however find someone to carry out this test will be difficult unless you can search the internet for a basic home test

advice and help drinking water company doha can anyone recommend a drinking water company that offer dispenser and water delivery  i recently have to cancel my brand new agreement with a water company because the water taste like plastic   not sure if the taste come from the new dispenser or the water or both  has anyone else have a similar experience here  
i m use nestle  and i m happy with them so far  
problem with nestle water be that they have one of the high content of sodium in their water  which be unhealthy for you  
oh really  did not realize that  which one would you recommend  
nomercy  its true nestle have the high sodium percentage  try rayyan 
 your profile say you be from italy and in italy they be paranoid of sodium in their water  all tv advert that promote water company promote their water   senza sodio   you should know good     
even hamad medical us and certifies them a the best a it contain d low amount of sodium and other mineral in right percentages  
hmmm 
try arwa  
i m use al manhal and the water sodium be medium  and the taste be not bad  once a week delivery though unless you call  they will delivery 1 2 more depend on how low your family be   their price be the same a take an empty container to the market and drag a full one back  but deliver to your door  my roommate also use wataniya  which for the first month be super service  multiple time a week  then seem to not be so super  but that could be that they change to one to two time a week delivery and my roommate never know  he also put them out too late when most of the service start 6 8am   the difference between the two be al manhal sometimes delivers leak overused bottle  and wataniya s bottle almost 100  look brand new  wataniya s taste be n t quite as good a al manhal s but still not bad at all  
banana cake  low sodium and smooth water to the troat be tanourine  i be not use if the supplier can provide water dispenser   i be only buy 1 5 l 
qatar living lounge help   how to stop severe hair fall i know this topic have be beat to a pulp  so to speak  but my problem be not male pattern baldness  alopecia  which be genetic and ca n t be stop  for now  i m start to lose much more than the normal amount of hair that fall every day  does anyone out there know or be use some home remedy to stop hair fall  please share  i m worried that if it continue  it will result to something like this  
get your hormone check and how do you know that it s not male pattern baldness  
han19 thanks for the prompt reply  i just base it on our family history  both side of parent  that nobody get bald at my age and even at old age  
or good yet  stop use for now  if not  maybe the food you eat  
azi  thanks  do you have any idea about food that can cause  or may trigger  hair loss  i have also think about that because since i come here my diet have change from what i use to eat back home  
go back to micronesia for a month or so and see if it make any difference  if it do  never come back  if it do n t  stay another month and get it treat by a good dermatologist  
too much of everything be bad  egg  chicken  nut  anything oily  perhaps  
if u be eat out regularly  i do  or otherwise and think that not much protein be go into your system get some protein supplement  atleast it stop hair fall for me  dont ask me how and why a i have no medical support to prove it   some guy from nutrilite speak to me and suggest  i follow and it work   but again you may not take my word and decide for yourself  
flexi i live in another country for some time before come to qatar but i do n t experience the same problem like here  so while look for some remedy to stop the excessive hair fall i m also try to figure out what cause this problem  azi  i do n t know which one either  but most of the time  i end up with resto food  
next time rinse your head with bottle water  more well if it evian

hi  would you know how much gold s gym s membership be  we have a lot of those in the philippines  also  would you be able to give me the address of the gold s gym  
i have n t get a clue  angel face  but i m glad you ask the question  maybe some doha veteran will help u out  i hear about gold s gym  but there do n t seem to be website  not a good sign  
i believe it s on d ring road  somewhere in the vicinity of the airport lulu s  
i personally have not be to it  but i would think that it the vast majority would be men  correct me if im wrong and i think you d feel uncomfartable  they be locate on d ring road  between mall r a and airport light  they have a big building and it be gold colour  do n t know about rate but my guess it not cheap a usual member would be weight lifter and bodybuilder  
gold s gym be close to the harley davidson showroom  at least i think it a harley davidson showroom  on d ring road  it s a big ugly golden building so you pretty much ca n t miss it  i do n t know how much the membership cost but i ve be tell it s a bit on the expensive side

qatar living lounge fitness first has anyone join fitness first in city centre  what do you think  
gr8 concept go ahead and join 
 king 07 what be the charge      winners never quit  quiter s never win    
 just go to see how much it cost  not that easy im afraid  first you have to have a   meeting   with a marketing rep who put you through a rigorous marketing questionaire  then they take u on the tour of the place  and then will they only begin talk about the price  so after all that rubbish here it go  and i shall attempt to simplify the overly confusing payment and membership option in 1 foul swoop  silver and gold  silver mean you pay monthly 499 qrl and another 1000 sign up and admin of around 250  plus a compulsory personal trainer session x3  460ryl   but they insist you pay for the 12th month on sign up  obviously to ensure they get your money whether you stay the 12 mths or not  all tell over 8000 ryl s for 12mnths  now gold  have no sign up  no admin and it only 459 ryl s a month  plus the same stupid compulsory personal trainer deal  12mth s will be round 5900 ryl s  so either stupidly get silver and pay over 8000 or pay upfront and pay 6000  they clearly prfer u pay u    
i be a member of fitness first club  they have very good facility and good trainer also  before you make an opinion just visit the club to see the facility  the charge be not very expensive  i get it for around 4 5k per year  but unfortunately because of some health problem doctor prohibits me from any work out  if you be interested i can transfer the membership to you  please give me a call  
oh my it too expensive especially to those who be earn a rank and file position in a company like me   you can afforf it if you be in good company pay you a good salary   be there any gym for men which we can afford the fee

big trouble a in maybe lose your her job and get deport  hopefully  no lash  maybe can plead for leniency but then again  ignorance of the law be no defense generally  rentals have  be come down  better to stay on her own or find other female friend to share accommodation with   beauty lie in the eye of the beerholder  
noooooooooooo never do dat 
it be big no    in qatar 
 know lot of people of the opposite gender share accommodation  what s the problem  like if there be a choice  i understand be thousand unit be available in different area  for affordable prices  but since qatar can not provide a normal level of affordable house  no point to demand to follow certain rules  do you know how hard to find a house for let s say single western female  next to impossible  all be either   for male    or for   indian    or for   filipino    so what this western lady should do  if she for example can not afford or simly do n t want to pay a fortune for little miserable independent cage   when at the same time she can find nice room in share with male villa for half price  eh     what lie behind u and what lie before u be small compare to what lie within u    oliver wendell holmes  
 qatarisun  the problem my friend be that it be illegal in the state of qatar for unmarried unrelated men  woman to live together in the same house apartment  be a lot of people do it  absolutely  but that do n t make it legal now do it   it s ha

hi actualy you have to respect qatar law  because should be family  so my advise for you do n t make problem stay far 
 it is illegal sharia law http  archive gulfnews com articles 06 03 24 10027928 html the sharia  how it affect you by bassma al jandaly  staff reporter published  november 02  2007  01 19 you could be share an apartment with a friend of the opposite sex  and the arrangement could be innocent  purely for financial reason  but in the eye of sharia law you be commit an offence  more and more people be be punish because they claim they be unaware of the law and it clause  there be hundred of case such a these that emerge each year either from the police or the court  an increase number of men and woman  who be not blood relative nor legally marry  and have share a flat  room or even sit in tinted car  be be jail and deport  a lawyer say  these men and woman have share no relationship  dr adel khamis al mimari from al itazan consultant and advocates say they be be punish in accordance with sharia law  the clause be know a   tawajed   or   tah    
caliph   wowwww    nice copy and paste  well if the sharia be against this why dont sharia comment and participate in make salary bite high or accomodation fee normal so people would be able to rent a descent place where to live  it be easy to talk and throw theory  but in reality many people they dont even have a single 2mx2m room where to live so they be oblige to share accomodation  1 room be for 2000 minimum     be that fair   even descent company here they dont pay u 2000 a accomodation allowance for bachelor    so let the shariaa people feel the prob before bla bla bla   specially before kill mickey mouse and accolade band      wake up  reality be different that all this   
it is not allowed  we have to respect qatari rules though for practical reason we need to have a sharing accommodation  
we have to respect qatari rules though for practical reason we need to have a sharing accommodation  it is not allowed  
it be officiay not allow  but  as long a there be no indecent behaviour in and around  then it be okay 
eagle  dont talk about sharia  if you want to share an accomodation  should it be with an opposite sex     you people be freak and sick  if you want to share an accomodation  share it with someone with the same sex  dont blame sharia  this be the way it should be   stupid 
there s another option  but the reality be that a lot of people live like this in doha  no problem at all  unless you get bust or point out  nobody be gon na ask your marriage certificate  unless you try to book a hotel room book 2 and you wont have any problems lol 
could you please give me good indication  i be even more confused now  what be really happen in the real world  please  do male and female share accommodation   many thanks  l 
is  it simple  the answer be no  
socialising live with girl friend  legal issue dear guy  i m go to share live with a lady in the same apartment  we be not marry  be there be any problem about that issue regard qatari law  friend  i want to notice that i mean the legal concern not people habit  thax alot

strictly not allow  can be prosecute with deportation in the simplest case  up to imprisonment and lash  and i be not kid  adultery between oposites sex without be marry be a seriuos issue  for westeners there seam to be some gray area  but in light of resent activity of the governmet to preserver their culture i would not want to try how big that gray area be  they want u here  but they for sure do not adapt their law for u  
plankton  with all do respect to your opiniun  i havent see any country or city  if y find one let me know  that will be well to change their law to adopt to the resident none the less to a visiter     now if y be a citizen of that country y might be able to do so by vote  i learn that no matter where y be you have to respect the law of that land 
dear second im speak about the law or the legal i need lowyer opinion for this matter there be any power for a police man to come home and ask who be this girl or not   im ask again about the law not opinion  
regarding stay with girl friend issue i think that we need lawyer opinion if any body have the experince just inform u that you have the legal experince please  thx 
its not allow  do not take chance  by do so you be invite trouble to your s and your g f s career  syed qadeer 5808554 
you do n t need the opinion of a lawyer you need to take the sound advice you have be give here  this be the law  however  you be a grown man and have to take decision on your own at your own risk and that of your girlfriend  you can ask many people and they will tell you no one will ever know  but it just take one nosey neighbour to understand and then all hell will break loose  
 take the advice of   plankton    confimed by our company lawyer in a previous simillar case   
i feel like a lot of this company be a bunch controller  the red pope of qatar living 
 it be against the law  and punishable a mention above  however  many people do it and you will generally only get catch if you flaunt it or upset someone who report you    only mad dog and englishman go out in the midday sun    
qatari culture be two unmarried couple allow to live together in one room  be two unmarried couple allow to live together in one room  
officially  no  
accord to qatar islamic law no but there be many filipini cpls stayn in najma and al saad  
no  you can get yourself in trouble  i hear a lot of people do it here  but you have to be very very careful  
yes  2 unmarried under same gender allow to live in a room  but unmarried opposite sex definitely not only in the room  not even in the house  flat  villa  
one unmarried couple be not allow to share a house never mind a room  
hi  be you talk about 2 ppl  1 man  woman  or 4  2 men  2 woman  in one room  in any case i dont think so it allowed 
in islam  wherever there be man and a woman  who be not relate either by blood or marriage   there be a 3rd  the devil  and a we all know  the devil be upto no good  
do n t risk it  
hey  hey  good question  oops     
compu  the answer to your question be  it do n t make any difference  it be illegal for people of different sex who be not relate  marriage  family  to share accommodation  o  by the way  why would a woman want to live with a guy without get marry   she s miss out on a ring and other perk that wifes get   she still do all the work that a wife would  again  without the perk that wife would have  and finally there be this risk she d take here   plus a guy will no see a reason to marry her since she s already do the job  ha ha ha just be cheeky  o  
advice and help girlfriend visiting  hotel problem  a friend of mine ask me to post this question his girlfriend be come to visit him from the us and they wan na stay at a hotel  would it be ok for them to take a hotel room  
this may be the wrng place to ask such a weird question  
i think u might be in trouble  me and hubby always spend a night in the hotel during valentine  eventhough we have our son with u  they still want to see our married certificate  go and figure  lol 
seems that novita77 get the idea  on the other hand you do n t  weird question   i do n t ask you to go with me to the hotel room so i do n t see anything weird here  
his us passport will go a long way to avoid any hassle  i have not have any problem with any hotel in the middle east as long a you do n t grope and fondle in the lobby  just check in a he would in the states and have a good time  hmmm  which personality be come out today  
dang novita  u get to be kidding me  i need to make a fake certificate now   coz my gurl gona be visit me soon  m in some serious trouble then  hey warider  lem me know wot u plannin to do  i ll join u if u gona make a fake certificate or so      
absolutely no problem  me and my wife travel a lot around the middle east and nowhere we be ask marriage certificate  this be absurd and total rubbish  no one carry around his marriage certificate  what would be the next  pet vaccination certificate  
once when i be book in with my female aunt   i think it be because we do not have a male escort they be very be very difficult  it be not a hotel i would normally choose to have stay in  but there be a big conference on and i have to resort to this one  turns out even my marriage certificate be not good enough a we get a knock on the door at 11 00pm and tell to leave the hotel  they say i do not have a ministry stamp on my marriage certificate  nor do i have a letter of permission from my husband  i be so angry   i get the man to ring my husband  but that be n t good enough either  this be when they say i need the ministry s stamp on my marriage certificate       anyhows  my husband and i have regularly stay in hotel in doha  if you be go to stay in one of the 4 or 5 star one they generally just ask you to produce your passport  i do n t think they will let you book the one room knowing you be not marry  if i be you  i would book in under your   
some people always go to wild think  when see asian woman with european man  and a kid in tow   lol  
 my gurl plannin to come next weekend and i enquire in a hotel and yes  they need a   marriage certificate   if you plan to stay with her at night  but u can visit all day till around 10 in the night and then have to leave  this be weird and crazy  warider  whats ur scene  wot u plannin   
 of course  maverick  from those who can not spell   girl   and   what   they will ask for a marriage certificate  because if you ca n t speak and spell that speaks for your good than the colour of your passport  and you know it matter here    
visas and permits how do i get my girlfriend into qatar  hi everyone  i m currently negotiate a position  i have be tell they will only include my partner in the package if we be marry   this be n t an option at this stage  i would like her to have the option to be able to live with me in doha  whether it permanent or not be another issue  any advice on how i can make this happen  appreciate all your help  
i be in a similar condition in 1990  i marry my girlfriend and the problem disappear  it s that easy  
even if you can bring her you still can not stay together it illegal here  and the only solution be marry her  but you have say it s far from your plan  you just can help her to find a job here and come and just see each other during your free time  but not live together  
so it illegal for guy and girl to live together  surely not  i guess the greter issue be that my place of work wo n t be able to add my girlf a a dependant to my sponsorship  does anyone know for how long i can get her a visa for qatar  eg if she fly in out a a tourist  
find her a job here  it s the only option if you re not yet ready to get married mate   you guy can live together  yes it s illegal but if the authority be to arrest  deport every unmarried couple live together in qatar  suffice to say there would be a significant drop in the work population of qatar  hope this help  i feel for you mate  
here  it be not allowed  best be careful  some people here  if they know unmarried couple who live together  they rat them out to the police  
 just marry her    there be so many rumor about me  feel free to believe in any of em     
 junarc2003  it s a question of a lifetime commitment    just marry her       like   just go to the corner shop  pick one up eh       and when you re do with it  go get another one i suppose     c mon mate  there s more to it than   just   when it come to one s life partner or at least there should be  ers 6  do n t bother with the   oohh it s illegal you ll get arrest   brigade  loads of young couple in qatar be unmarried  the people around them  neighbours include  think they be  only their close friend know they re not  yes they do live happily  ever after sometimes     
gadarene  do you know that there be something call d i v o r c e   
yes i do magicdragon  your point be   
 bottom line be it illegal  and we be not here to give illegal advice  two unmarried people can live together  but here his issue be about put her under the   dependent   tag which i dont think he can do if shes just his girlfriend  simply put you cant have the cake and eat it too  good fortune always come knock at your door  when you be sh tting in the toilet         smoke      
qatari culture girlfriend visit me hi all  i start work in qatar in august  and my girlfriend will go visit me in september  can she stay at my place  for how long  i m spanish and she be german  thanks a lot for your help  cheers 
it s strictly prohibit in qatar to stay together if the man  woman be not legally marry  take care 
you risk arrest and deportation  your decision whether to risk it or not  
visit you and get deport  it be beter you visit her and keep work otherwise you be invite trouble along with her  choice be yours 
why take the risk  let her stay with me and i ll bring her over to visit you when she feel like it  o  
in law we do not have girl friends so moi give visa to wife only incase usa or europe also they will not entertain girl friend visa  allowed category be family visit visa  
be ready to face the future consequence then  
i like the comment of britexpat lol cheeky  just be careful but it up to you it be after all your girlfriend and be far from each other suck  go for it lol 
it be illegal here in qatar  be careful  
it be ok if you keep it discreet and not publicize it like this   
it be illegal  in hotel for example they will never allow her in to your room and vi versa unless you have a marriage certificate  but at your place i do not think so  the main issue be the visa 
salary and allowances 13000qar all inclusive hi there  i get an offer to work in qatar  the package they be offer be roughly around 13000qar include housing  transport allowance  it be enough for me  i be currently single and plan to get marry next year  i be wonder if i could save some money  maybe 2000 3000qar per month  appreciate your feedback  thanks  
you should be save atleast 11000 pm  because 1500 for a shared room  500 for food  what else  take lift from a kind colleague  share lunch with a married person sit next to you            wed  20 08 2014  10 55 hr 
spend 8 day  weekend  at your friend or relative or countryman place  there r so many way to limit your expences provide you ve the will power    wed  20 08 2014  11 00 hr 
khalli  the poor soul be new  spare him from the rude wording atleast for the time be   wed  20 08 2014  12 34 hr 
thanks melt metal  wow  that s a lot  what if i m go for studio apartment or 1 bedroom apartment  since i m get marry later  do not prefer share  i browse the internet and it will cost around 4000 5000 per month  is there any chance to find a cheap one  
khalli  get you vision be clear like a mirror  there r no we  they or others  we all belong to one      come out of your cocoon  http  i25 photobucket com albums c76 usaviator facebook 4th  20of  20july 34609 jpg 
 spare him from the rude world  and you re tell him to spend every day of the week eat the food of the   marry person sit next to you   and every day of the weekend eat the food of   friends or relatives or countryman   and never once return the favor  we obviously have different definition of what be rude and selfish   
http  i25 photobucket com albums c76 usaviator facebook 4th  20of  20july 34609 jpg 
i d love to know what kind of accommodation you can get for 1500 month  i bet it s really fancy  maybe you could share a room to save money  or share a bed with a countryman  
fubar  look everybody come into this world empty hand  what we earn  spend remain here  so nothing wrong if you r be kind  share your food etc with those who genuinely need it  do good  find good my friend be the best policy    wed  20 08 2014  12 44 hr 
you be tell this guy he can save 11  000 qar per month by take other people s food  and then say he genuinely need it   that s completely idiotic  11  000 month be 10x what a lot of people earn in qatar  try to be sensible and not just motivate by greed and selfishness  
qatar living lounge girlfriend visit hi  i be go to be post to work in qatar  i hear that it be illegal for unmarried couple to stay together in qatar  be that true  and if so  if my gf would to visit me on a visit pas for a couple of week  can she stay with me  thanks for your help  
as per the law  it true  unmarried couple can not stay together in the same place  but trust me  there be alot of unmarried couple stay together here  the only way to go abt it be by not make a major talk show abt it  
thanks for reply  but what if neighbour or god know who report me in  how sensitive be this matter in qatar  
she may stay with u but do n t get caught  goodluck on that  
 better not do it  and if you be catch  you and she will be lash  jail and deport  if you live in in phils  dont do it here  dont get inspire by the reality that there be some here live together who be not legally marry  you will regret    there s nothing we can do to change the past  if it teach you a lesson profit from it then  forget it     
even if i be not a muslim i presume  so the only arrangement for have someone visiting be to put her in a hotel  is that alright then  
 for the sake of love   do what you must  if thing will get worst   be they go to share the same jail    i do n t go back on my word  that s my way of ninja    
wishful thinking  do n t count on long term free room and board   
hey you man  good luck to you  think much   speak little  write less  it is never too late to learn  hal ko i m get worst  
 too bad     i do n t go back on my word  that s my way of ninja    
one other issue to consider be whether or not you will be in company housing  people tend to be a little more judgmental when they be share the same accomodations  hotels be best  mandi 
family life in qatar is it possible to get marry a filipina lady  christian  with an egyptian guy  muslim   known somebody whose ask this kind a question    hope somebody can give u an answer  thanks 
technically they can get married  but please let her know the guy first and read more about egyptians  
wel possible she will have to change her religion 
maybe yes  in the philippine it easy to get married whatever u r nationality  if i wer u if u r willing just be happen ur marry in the philippines just fight for love  
yes  but some need you to change your religion its your decision they should also do vice versa  
as a muslim he should know this answer already  
yes of course but if you will get marry here then she should convert to muslim  but they can also get marry in philippines in a civil wedding  like what i do  i get marry last year in philippines civil wedding and just recently here in qatar  i just decide that i be willing so i convert to muslim and get marry again my husband  he be lebanese  in muslim way  
first she should convert to muslim  and she need to provide   birth certificat  singleness cerficate  no objetion letter from her parent  singleboth should be certify through foriegn ministry  the guy should have also singleness certificate from his country and should be certify by the fm  then go to court near mannai r a and provide all the document then they will give you a appointment  good luck   
it be possible but i think the mentality of guy be more important than legal procedure  it be not so easy for muslim egyptian to marry a christian filipino  
good luck  
yes friend you can  somebody think that she have to change her religion to muslim  that be not true  a she be a christian lady  she can worship the god a per christian instruction  and islam religion respect other religion specially christian  so no problem at all the verse versa be prohibit  but if a muslim lady want to marry a christian man  not allow and everybody know the reason  go ahead  enjoy life  and count from 1 to 10 while you ask this question  can i control my kid believe in future  what be her attitude when you get up early to prey alfajr  what type of food you will share together  what about ramadan fasting  so many question  and the most importent question  why you fail to find an egyption lady  good luck

socialising doha rock festival when will it happen  like dubai desert rock festival  would you want to have a rock festival here  and which band do you want to be on stage  agree or disagree  vote  
madona  saggy that would be so rock i think   nepal 
i disagree  rock should never be allow  it should be ban and our ear should never be torture by such crap  
listening to a band of heavy rock be like have a super nurse insert a 20 gage needle in my arm  be fearful when others be greedy  and be greedy when others be fearful   
lol rp  that feel good to some of some persuasion  i m think  rock sound like something much more painful  such a a cactus suppository   
jazz festival would be good  
there be nothing like rock  classic  heavy  indie  pop  it get them all  i do n t think that there be any other generic that can be like that  do not dwell in the past  do not dream of the future  concentrate the mind on the present moment   gautama buddha  
 two word  jamie callum if you look very carefully you will notice that the name   jamie callum   be actually an anagram of   egotistical over rated shyte    
who be saggy  
that would be great if a rock festival ever happen here  bands wish list  the script  yeah   keane the killers led zeppelin  i wish   black sabbath  how i wish   pearl jam audioslave dashboard confessional and the list go on  there s too many to mention hehehe

why do you want to stop smoking  smoker never become old  they die young 
 say it to urself for a million time  till u become piss off    den u can stop smoking  lol peace     
good decision  keep sweet in your pocket and whenever you think about smoke take one and chew it and keep away where the smoker stay  to prevent smoke again this be an advise from me  
1  keep something warm between your finger whenever you feel smoke 2  if you be work in a high riser  walk down the stair for smoking and walk up the stair on the way back  you will feel rather not walk and automatically not smoke  3  have a hot cup of green tea 4  when ever you get an urge to smoke indulge in something that you like do

 dear friend  first of all let me tell you that there be nothing wihich can stop you from smoke other than your will to give up smoking  you need to first understand what be the thing which make you smoke  1  your mindset  it want support  support of some kind which will give peace to your mind during tension  stress  anger etc  in case of smoker it   smoking   so you have to build your own support mechnism  like music  which ever you like  any physical activiy like cycling  exercise  play tennis  football  swim anything  and that u only can identify  2  nicotine cycle  levels of nicotine in blood  this be the nicotine content in the blood which get lower and bue to which the necotine which be absorb by your lung enters into your blood through your lung  alveolies  and carry into the blood stream through artery to heart and pump to brain through artery  this whole process be call a nicotine cycle  this nicotine when reach you brain give you feeling

 its actually surprisingly easy if you want to stop smoking   i quit after nearly 23 year of smoking when i find out that i be pregnant  years and year of my family nag me  bribe me  beggin me  always the fear of the   side effect   if i have to quit and the hard head insistance that i like smoking and it be my outlet from stress and yabba yabba  i be honestly piss off with myself when i do stop and the truth hit home how much damage i have do to myself and to my relationship for so long and all for nothing   there be no cold turkey  no shake  no cough  no sudden uncontrollable energy  no sudden weight gain  etc  etc  what do happen  anxiety and stress left   and the smell of stale smoke and the taste of it become more repulsive than ever  and i suddenly be open to socialise with people that do n t smoke  it be actually annoyingly easy to stay quit  did n t need zyban  nicorettes  mouth spray or anything  i have start reading alan carr s book   the easy way    
yes recently one of my friend do  d 
try all way to make my husband quit but no use  tell him abt the negative effect it have on health but i think no one need a reason to quit  it something u have to decide on ur own  
you just need willpower to quit   
i quit two year ago  was quite tough  i use nicotine chewing gum for first few day  i still dream of smoking and feel i be just a millimeter  or a puff  away from be an addict again  do n t allow yourself even a single puff for me  stay away from ambience which make you feel like smoke  quit one hundred percent  do n t give any concession to yourself  be ruthless  positives of quit far outweigh the negative  i do gain weight but reduce it a i could execise well now  smoking anyway be outlaw almost everywhere  it s out of fashion too  i do n t blame my previous generation for glorify it a they do know less about the harm  if someone pick up the habit now or still continue with it then he or she definitely be an ignorant person  it make you sick and smelly  
i use champix by pfizer   
smoking  quite hard to quite by any smoker  a  due to smoke the addict s certain body cell be use to it  when he try to quite  these cell try to revolt thus the quieter feel various aggravation and complication  but after all what matter be strong will power to over come this agitation by those particular body cell

shipping from australia  hi  i be move over in january from oz and i be think about ship a box over to doha  from what i can find on the net it seem to be fairly pricey  just wonder if anyone have any tip on who i should use  or if it be just easy to use excess baggage  thanks  
moving to qatar doha port  shipping from uk hi  i be have some of my good ship over from the uk and want some advice about port charges service etc  items i m bring be thing like books manuals and clothes toileteries etc  does anyone know what charge be involve and be there any info online  regards ps  what s the weather like there in april  
we do n t get charge anything extra at this end  give a note to the courier company state it s personal belonging and you will be take them back when you leave qatar  then they will give it to custom  hopefully  you wo n t get charge either  if you have n t get anything nice to say  do n t say anything at all  
thanks you for that great tip  lol  is that the courier in uk i need to give the note to  he s already aware of my belonging  he tell me a i will be work for the govt i may be charge less  but free be well   hope to hear again  
find a good forwarder in the uk who could deliver your stuff door to door  that s ddp  delivered duty paid for incoterms 2000   so receiver should not worry about anything to pay a shipper will pay all the charge before it can be ship out from the uk to qatar  dhl  ups and fedex can handle this kind of shipment  just dont forget  shipping terms should be ddp in the airway bill  btw  april weather start to warm  hot season s peak july and august cheers  
yep  give it to the courier company with your belonging in the uk  we have a door to door service too  but we use a small company  not sure if it make a difference  but we have our belonging bring over by air  if you have n t get anything nice to say  do n t say anything at all  
thank you for your reply  appreciate  i think big company  big bill  i ve get a small company and arrange for the item to be deliver to port only  2 4 box of book and clothes  might see what else i can add to the pallet  lol  
i recently ship a large shipment of good from the us via allied shipping  i pay the us company  they inventoried  pack  box  and ship everything here to qatar  once it clear custom  it be pick up by the partner company here in doha and deliver to my door  i never have to deal with a single piece of paper on the doha side of thing  aside for sign my inventory and acknowledge receipt of shipment  
and what do that cost and do you know the size  weight of your good  
chapter  4   personal effect and household item article  103  the personal effect and use household item bring into the country by the national reside abroad or the foreigner come for the first time for residence in the state shall be exempt from custom duty  subject to the condition and restriction  http  www customs gov qa eng enactment customs lawforqatar part8 jsp ddu shipment  delivered duty unpaid   where good place at the disposal of the consignee  you  at doha port  therefore  upon cargo arrival  cost will be  docs fee  custom clearance  minus the import tax  and haulage service to delivery address  suggestion  if you do n t know of any good forwarder here in qatar  send it ddp  
thank you for that information boyet  
welcome  cheer   
moving to qatar ship personal effect just wonder if it s worth ship the kid bike  skateboard  xbox360 etc over with our other personal effect from new zealand  what have others do  cheers  
no worry  all you need to do be assess how much it would cost to bring your stuff down  then compare it with purchase the same from qatar  
my suggestion be that if you can fit toy in with your other effect without huge expense then anything you can bring that will keep them entertain here be a good thing  and will save you time and effort try to duplicate it all after you arrive  actually your child probably wo n t want to spend much time on their bike and skateboard during the hot summer month here  and depend on where you will be live  it might be difficult to find somewhere in your neighbourhood for them to ride around safely too  by the way  while you re pack  i would be tuck a big jar of vegemite into a spare corner  if your kid like it  a it be very hard to find here and the few 150gm jar i have ever see here cost a bomb  hope this help  
it largely depend where you will live  if you be on a compound  many kid ride their bike  skateboard inside the compound  the electronic item  i would definitely bring because they will be much more expensive here  good luck with your move  
basically the kid  12 and 8  bring a few special toy etc with them and we purchase other item ie bike etc once we arrive  we purchase a wii here for less than it would ve cost in nz but you have to be careful that if you bring your own ps and buy disk here that they be compatible  likewise if you buy a new ps here that it be compatible with what be sell back in nz  virgin sell pal  we do n t ship anything a we do n t know how long we would be here for and only come with suitcase and pay the excess baggage charge  looks like we may be head out sometime this year anyway and i m so pleased that we do n t go the full hog and ship everything over  
i wish we d bring more stuff with u when we come from nz last year  do n t have any advice re kid stuff but here s what i wish i d know  bring cushion cover  knick knacks  throw  and art  the furniture selection here be dismal but even bad be try to find the little thing  depending on your taste you may be ok but if for example you like really simple contemporary thing you re out of luck  we struggle to find thing like a plain shower curtain  or a plain white dinner set  definitely bring cutlery  do n t bring duvet cover  the duvet here be size differently and wo n t fit them  you probably wo n t need to bring sheet either  you ll end up with a king or super king bed  bring book  incl kid book  there be no good bookshop here bring a box of bit and piece  thing like craft knife  quick unpick  tape  tapemeasure  vivids  etc you can buy all these thing here but not necc at the same shop  i buy a box of random office stuff and i m so glad i do  if you br   
if you have a generous shipping allowance  ship everything that matter to you and especially to your child  if you have special hobby  ship any tool or item specific to that hobby  for example  quilters can not buy bat in qatar  or only rarely  many child s toy be available very cheaply in qatar  make in china  many break quickly or do n t work properly  if you will live on a compound  a bike be a fun thing to have  but bike on the street in qatar be a hair raising and life threatening experience  bring book  bring anything that will make your life more homey and that will bring you comfort  bring thing you love but can leave behind or sell when leave qatar  know you can replace them back home  as emma say  you can buy just about anything  but you may not like your choice  there be a lot of cheap  and ugly  stuff available  but quality be rare and may be price two or three time high than at home  on the other hand  there be european appliance which s   
i totally agree with emmas and intlxpatr  i m sooo glad we bring a huge stock of kid  book and toy  it be definitely worth it  
yes  bring as much stuff a you can for the kid  bring shoe for yourself  sandal  shoe shopping no that great here  go to briscoes for super king sheet and king size single sheet  one of the most important thing to get  unless you actually enjoy sleep on a concrete slab  be a mattress topper  like a foam latex pad to go directly on top of your matresses  i suffer for a few month before manage to find one here but it take a bit of hassle and homework first  bring one if you can so that you have it straight away  we do n t bring a vacuum clean and find we do n t need one  the tiled floor get swept and mopped lots of my daughter s dvds don  t work here  wrong zone  our tv work here  bring yours if want to  
we be constantly have to order and ship thing over from nz  the uk  the us a they be not available here  we end up pay way too much in shipping charge but you just can not get the product here of the appropriate quality and any time you be look for something specific you can never find it a the choice be extremely limited  just recently it be toddler car seat and only today we have order a wooden playpen online from nz to ship here a we can not find a lightweight one in qatar  we be constantly get our family to buy and send u baby product from nz which we can not get here  so definitely bring whatever you can include medicine  homeopathic remedy if you use them  a they be not available at all here   skin care treatment etc  you can always sell old toys things once the kid grow out of them or before you leave again  particularly if they be good quality item  
also  a other post have recommend  bring kitchen item  crockery etc too  we do not bring our everyday dinner set and spent age try to find something that be dishwasher and microwave safe  we give up a everything be too patterned and be one or the other or neither  it be the simple  basic thing that be hard to come by here  
doha shopping pc modders and gamers  any pc modders here   any hardcore gamers around   if yes  then this be the place for you all  discussing about pc modifications  building higher end rigs  computer relate discussion  doubt anything  
how do you define hardcore gaming  
 hardcore gamer be those who use their pc 24 7 play their favorite game that require high end configuration  a psu worth qr1000  1gb display card qr 1500  so on and so forth  run  jump make noise but do not sin

come from australia  we re big bbq ing ppl  most bbq s here be coal brickettes  they come in all size and many ppl have little compact one that get use when take on day out to the beach  we have choose to go with as there be our concern with store gas bottle during the summer  we didnt want to leave a gas bottle inside our villa while be away for most of the summer month and not have the air conditioner on  have say that  carrefour do sell a good range of gas bbq s as well  big 4 5 burner one or that have wok burner too  happy bbq ing and a we say in australia i ll throw another shrimp in the barbie for ya   
apollo furniture carry an australian line of gas bbqs here in doha  i do n t have one so ca n t comment  i have a charcoal weber  american  which do the job just fine  but i buy it in the uae 
you supply the bbq  i ll supply the beer  
i company be pay fro the shipping  then yes  otherwise you can probably get something here  
thanks for all the comment  my question regard gas bbq be if i can get the tank refill and if the connection will be the same  i do n t even consider charcoal brickette grill since i do n t think you can get coal brickettes in doha  is it widely avilable  
the bbqs here be very  very overprice  and they be aussie design be only 1 2 be grill  the other 1 2 be solid plate  like a frying pan  sucks  it over a thousand buck for a decent one  and bring your own smoker too  
yall get into a q  
briquette be widely available a be a variety of make and model of charcoal bbqs  i would say good gas grill be expensive compare to canada  the us and australia but be become more available  as for compatibility  i have the charcoal grill  all i need be light fluid  but i understand there be serious issue with north american gas grill compatibility but someone else would have to speak to the specific  
bring it with you  we purchase one from lowes and have it ship unassembled  still in the box  and do n t regret it one bit  i do recommend have a cover for it else the dust and grit will quickly work it charm  you can change the hose and connection fairly easily once you arrive  the canister be large in doha than they be in the u s   so do n t count on the tank fit under your grill  
qatar living lounge outback australia what do you think life in the australian outback would be like

welcome to qatar aramex v fedex or dhl  recently  i spot a post about aramex and think it be a neat service  my husband  however  be less than impressed  say we could use fed ex or dhl  if you like aramex  what be the pro over other company  also  if anyone s sent received time sensitive document through this company  i d like to know how your experience go  thanks  
i ve send n receive too many time with all of them each time i experience to send sensetive paper a you meantioned but what i notice that dhl be the fast one incase you have limit time n hurry for something  and a a personal view i say all be safe enough and well servicing the bad thing be  you have to pick up ur stuff from their office after they inform u that you have a shipment would be good if they could delivery at the door  wish you the best  
well i dont know about others but find dhl good always a i only have use dhl always  
my choice be dhl 
although i have try aramex for auto part  i still prefer dhl or fed ex  they can all deliver door to door  i be not very impressed with aramex s delivery time  
me and my wife would use aramex to send document for our distance educ class base in australia  we choose aramex over dhl because of the pricing they give  they can deliver it quickly enough  though of course dhl and fedex  or ups  be well at that  but with pricing  i d say aramex  for document that be  but with jewelry or gadget  etc  im not really sure i d choose aramex to deliver those for me  
i have use aramex and dhl  aramex delivery time be always long than they say on their website  dhl on the other hand even come in early sometimes  dhl be more expensive  but in my opinion  worth it  
aramex  
dears  it s a matter of support what these company be get in base country  as well a there own resource  however i experience fedex excellent in uae  as well a dhl here in qatar  aramex  no idea sorry   
writing my experience with all of them   i find dhl best in send time sensative documents    moreover  a per my conversation with one of the managers in dhl  who be also my friend  tell me  the pressure be much less due to lack of business in recessions so  this make me sure that their service will be good  faster a none of your thing would be queue or neglect  
 dalsey  hillblom and lynn  dhl    period  
doha shopping do you shop online with auction  i be set up my home and be think of try ebay or similar site to try to save money  i might try to list some of my thing to sell as well  i be wonder about ship and fee and so on  does anyone have experience with this  
great shopping on ebay  i have do several time  ship cost should be mention on item description  if not just ask the seller  but be careful on read the fulll description carefuly  regard like warranty  refund  exchange  damage  geniune  new or use etc  
i think thats hectic for a place like qatar  especially the shipping cost and the time take to arrive  why dont you try any local shop like home centre or home r u if it for furniture  there be a hundred other shop in salwa road for furniture  household item etc etc etc  wats that u exactly wan na buy   img nid 17892 title http  braveatheart blogspot com desc link none align left width 180 height 135 
i use ebay in conjunction with aramex for ship  some seller on ebay will ship direct to qatar as well  you will need to decide if it s wise to spend the extra on shipping or perhaps buy locally  aramex be a cost effective shipper from the state and the uk  when you join their shop  ship service they give you a postal address in the usa and uk  you have you item deliver to that address  and then they forward your good to a depot here at reasonable rate  i do n t think sell item on ebay be a viable option from qatar  but somebody else may think otherwise  
i have do it for many time  ebay be trustful a far rank be concern  i have receive many item through some cheap mean  pm me if interested    
http  www qlassified com it look like a new site  just get start  it s like ebay  but free  and it s in qatar  i sell on ebay before i move  but this look like a good option  what do you think  
ahhhh   i see 5m4rtglamour this thread be a setup for you to push your new  very new  classify website  very clever  firstly it s slow  secondly some of the image do n t load and finally there be not enough traffic on it  but it look like you be try to address that    
timebandit  i wish i own the site  but i do not  i be hop to find something like it to use to make purchase  
ebay be good  two thing  mind where you be buy the stuff from  if you be buy from china or hongkong  then the seller would ship the item to qatar with hk post which be cheap and most of the time he offer it free  but the wait time be minimum one month and 45 day be normal  you can opt to get it by hk register post too with additional shipping cost range from  4 to  20  which be much faster and secure  if you be buy from other country like us  the standard shipping be do with usps which be no good than hk post  it take a month too  alternatively if you opt to get it ship with ups dhl fedex from the buyer  then price for ship range anywhere from  140  alternatively to buy from the us seller be easyshop by dhl  or shop n ship by aramex  check their website to know how they work  
thanks  shyams  i be think of try the one i list above just to see how it work  i think it be in qatar  so the shipping may be good  i think i will try to sell something first  because the site look so new  there be n t too many thing to buy  i ll let you know how it go  
you be welcome  till now i havent see any ebay seller from qatar   
qatar living lounge teachers head to akis al khor  anybody else out there start at al khor international school in september 2010  would be good to make some contact in advance  share info etc  already have a colleague there that i use to work with  2 in fact  but keen to hear from others too

hi  my husband and i both have job at akis for september 2010  we be come from melbourne  australia and be both pe teacher  we be both really excite about it  thats great you have some contact there already  what do they say about living in the community and the school  what do you teach and where be you from  nice to make contact with you

hi andy  good to hear from you  my husband be from the uk too  i be australian  we will be go with our two young kid  2 year and 5 month  thats good to hear that food be cheap there  anything else interest you have read  how long have you be in nz  enjoyed it  the community sound great do n t it  seems like there will be lot of thing to do  mel 
hi mel  i guess most of the stuff that i have learn so far about akis and qatar be probably the same a you  actually find out stuff seem difficult compare to most thing on the internet  lots of stuff seem to be out of date and this forum seem mostly full of people that struggle to put a sentence together  for whatever reason   we have find nz to be an interesting experience but we miss our family and friend and financially we have be bad off  food be especially expensive here  so it be good to find it cheap there  i have be tell that because the restaurant in the community be subsidise you can eat well for a couple of dollar  the school seem to have the same politics  issue of any school  so i guess it all depend on who you end up be mate with a to how bearable it be  where in the uk be your husband from and what prompt the move  if you want to use email rather than this hopeless website my address be evansfamilynz  xtra co nz found anyone else go   
hi andy  i will drop you an email soon  no  we do n t know of anyone else go there  did you read the forum from last year of the bunch of teacher leave from the uk  i find that quite interesting  do you have any kid  will your wife be work too  do you know what the child care option be  my husband be bear in ireland but grow up in coventry and have be here for 4 year  we have be talk for age about work overseas and think we would just give it a go and see if anything come up  the middle east sound good from a tax free point of view and also because it be only one flight away from the uk  we plan to visit our relative there quite often  mel   
hi mel  yes i saw that post about the teacher all head out on the same flight  i imagine there be just as many this year but i guess they have n t find this thread found this website want to remain anonymous  we have 2 kid  both boy  13  9   we have n t tell them yet  that be a job for this holiday  not quite sure what their reaction will be but i be sure they will be please to be close to their family  we have book flight to the uk at the end of july and will be spend 5 week there before get the plane to doha  gill be train a a junior teacher but have n t do that for a while  i think she be hop to get something in the school once we get there  i m sure it make more financial sense for them to employ people who be already there  we ll see  the guy i know there who be head of geography say that because his wife be also teach there they have find child care quite tough and have struggle with get the home work balance right  so i think it will make   
hi andy  good luck tell the kid  i hope they think it be good news  i be guess your kid will be go to akis  yes  run could be interest  might just have to settle for the treadmill in the gym for most of the year  what do you mean that your friend have find child care tough  that be my only concern about the move over there  that the kid be go to be ok  i know there be the akis nursery  would you mind ask your friend about child care for under 2 year  enjoy the holiday in nz    
no problem  i ll ask him for more detail and pass them on  
have not speak to nigel in a while but will try next weekend  how be your preparation go

doha shopping best place to buy laptop in doha  hi guy  where s the best place to buy a laptop  best price brands range etc  thanks  
sofitel  jarir book store  pc one  
thanks smoke  you get a preference  or pretty much the same  are price fix  
cheap go for sofitel  basically the same stuff you get at the rest of the place where they be over price  pc one be good than jarir in my opinion  
you can also check lulu hyper or carrefour a your last option  
does sofitel product carry the kind of warranty that pc one  jarir  lulu  carrefour etc would provide  
cheers  
of course they do  mostly 1 year warranty  and if anything break down their repair charge be low than what you d be pay at jarir or pc one  
 sofitel be a place where you can   bargain   for the same dell laptop that have   fix   price at these other location   
thanks  will keep that in mind  i be give to understand they do n t provide warranty     
what i like about sofitel be they can give you a laptop a per your specification like more ram or increased hdd space  
advice and help which laptop to buy  please advise  hi2ueverybody  i be plan to buy a laptop but i have visit couple of mall  get confuse between dell  toshiba  pls suggest me which late model be good  available in qatar or someone who have experience about these two  thanks in advance for your valuable reply  
i have use both laptop i wud prefer to take toshiba good than dell 
macbook pro be the best  
the dell macbook or the toshiba macbook    
thanks  dawood will you suggest any model no of it  
why buy a laptop when you can buy one of these http  eee asus com eeepad transformer infinity features  or one of these http  www asus com mobile padfone  laptops be so last generarion  anyways between toshiba and dell both be great just make sure you go for the dell xps built quality of dell be generally better toshiba have small issue with it connector  
agree with tryke  no good way to go than a macbook  i wo n t ever have anything different 
try lenova g570 it have international warranty  lead screen  lot of space  windows7 etc 
i be use mac book pro where i can load 4 operate system  i have 2 o s now  one be lion and other be windows 7 with share file  by use hand gesture  i can change the os in one second  but vm ware be use by me to install these 2 o s together  but life be so cool with mac airbook and 2 o s  i have the freedom to use the capability of both the os i recommend this to all my frds who wish to look at have the best one for the next 2 year atleast  advantages be also it be ssd and very light weight  
macbook be apple s laptop brand name  it will be expensive but the best  and not with microsoft os   among toshiba and dell dell be the best  
now i can take a decision what to buy  regards  
doha shopping what to compare when buy laptop  hi guy  i would like to purchase a new laptop  so i be think lenovo would be well from the other option tha i have  like toshiba dell hp asus acer etc  so guy tell me what all thing i should look for when buy a laptop like ram  processor  ghz  memory  design  color  price etc 
thnk only about money  performance almost same  
performance almost the same  lol yeah type of processor  size of memory  screen size and resolution  weight  all irrelevant  sure  
1  do n t buy too famous brand  they be not offer anything extra 2  look for the best configuration that suit your need  3  personally i recommend dell  lenovo  acer and asus  4  depending on your budget you should look for the best option  at the moment the best configuration that do n t cost that much be core i5 second generation  4 gb ram  500  gb hard drive  15 6 inch screen  the graphic card be a plus but not mandatory since i5 second generation have a pretty good integrate graphic  basically the good the cpu the good the graphic performance   so at this time i would recommend  dell inspiron 15r  i5 sg  500gb  4 gb ram  gt525m  1gb graphic memory  this be buy by a friend of mine from sofitel with 2300qr  something cheap than that  acer have some laptop that be very cheap but give very good performance  they be use some old cpu s brought back to life by the second generation from intel  like celeron   this i have right now  acer aspire 5349  celeron b800    
 runner thanks man  ya the main thing be brand  n what about their customer service  so you didnt say anything about lenovo  i will be use laptop a lil bit rough  so kindly say from this 3 which will be best  
is msi laptops good in work  
brand do n t matter  i do n t think so  beat these  1  my hp laptop be turned on 24 7 since may 2008  2  i use it daily to watch movie  bluray  1080p movie   3  downloading most of the time  4  it s turn on even if i m not home  5  turned off only when i need to restart it after an update  6  always rely on it to retrieve important file  basically it s processor be busy 24 7 thanks hp  
well in that case of rough use too i think lenovo will do fine  coz i hav be use hp for the last 4 year n now it wont work  dell give good customer service  
try consider samsung  in my personal opinion  most laptop be asembled in china now a days  
think about an apple  
think about an apple  if your budget permit

best to buy from qatar  because in qatar no tax like uk and no customs 
you can find good laptops range from gbp 370  550 approximately with good configuration   i do n t know the price in uk  you can calculate accordingly   good luck 
do n t know about uk but here you can find laptops with good configuration range from gbp 350 550   rest do the math from ur end  
htoufik  read exiledsaint s post  tax refund will give a similar price to here but choice in uk will be well a it s a much big market  
laptops i think laptop be cheaper in the uk than over here at present  if you know what you need on it get it in the uk and bring out here  if not it be like everywhere search aound for a good price  pcone be a good place to start up salwar road  but also a lot of the supermarket have weekly deal that be very good 
you may not be able to fix it in qatar if there be a problem later on a you have uk gaurantee  its best to get it qatar  thats exactly what i do  
when you buy it  make sure the warranty be global or worldwide  atif242  yes you do n t have to pay tax when you buy the item  but tax be pay on the item when it be import to qatar and that be definitely pass down to you in the form of retail price  might be a little cheaper in the uk because they probably import in huge quantity unlike qatar  but none can beat laptop price in the us    
well best way to buy 2 in qatar because later u can claim the warranty  
true lps be cheaper in uk than in qatar but you should buy from here bcoz if you get some problem than you can repair it with only qatar gurentee here or else if uk provide international gurentee than you can check with jarir book store i think they accept international gurentee otherwise thesedays you get lp here with good rate and late specification fot that you have to check in jarir bookstore and from city center  carrefour  and many more place i get 2 lps  toshiba and dell  be they be work awesomely alhumdulillah

welcome to qatar where in doha be the best place to buy a laptop  q267 
al jarir book store carrefour 
go to jarir bookstore  would not recommend carrefour  their after sale service awful  
jarir bookstore  or lulu  its cheaper  and same warranty i had my hp pavilion  
lulu or sofital plaza both have little cheap 
jarir bookstore 
dont go to sofitel they aint  so trustworthy  good buy from jareer or carrefour  
carrefour or you can also buy it from the outlet of computer arabia  in case if you wan na buy a dell laptop  there after sale service be also trust worthy and also lulu hyper market 
nowhere    all laptop be so outdated by their capacity and price too high for such a low capacity machine  just check and compare with www futureshop com and you ll see what i mean  
emax centerpoint
