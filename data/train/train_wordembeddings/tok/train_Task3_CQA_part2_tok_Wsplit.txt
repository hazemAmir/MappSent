family with 2 kids 9 5 years old both school going salary package of 20k with no other benefit is it a good deal 
for family with 2 child you ll probably need 2br flat which will cost about 7000 8000 and for schooling you ll probably need 4000 5000 so it means these two will take major chunk of your salary further you can take 3000 monthly living expense and 2000 for conveyance additionally any medical requirements now its upto you to decide

i am new lady driver and today is my first drive from home to office when i was driving home at the cid office junction the green light was blinking when i already driving through about 2 meter when the light turn yellow then red am i gon na get fine qr6000 for this please your kind advise if you ever had this experience thank you so much nervous mom 
hi few month ago i got a fine as broke red signal and it is around 6000qr and i went there nd requested them bt there are nt listening and tellig me that you have to pay anyone who know how to reduce this fine pls tell me thank you so much 
do n t run reds you fool 
can someone tell me at what point does it take a pic of you and fine you for crossing the red light if you cross while the yellow is on can you stil get fined lets say you cross the line and stop the car and the light becomes red what will happen then thanks 
i ve been beating a yellow blinking light since the time i cant remember but had no fines so far i think its only crossing the line when its already red silent g 
hi all think i am in trouble while passing a flashing green light i kind of thought the radar took a pic of me everybody is telling me that the ticket is only for red light passing can anyone help 
no ticket for crossing over a flashing green light technically it s still green and flashing is just a warning that it ll turn red the flashing you think you saw is probably the guy behind you flashing you to drive faster or get out of the way o 
traffic signal at the sword junction i witnessed an unfortunate driver attempting to stop at red light had his front wheels just cross the sensor the camera flashed instantaneously but he stopped will he be penalized 
yes bt not 6000 only 600 
if the red light turns red while in the middle of intersection is it considered jumping the red light if you stop past the white line is it considered jumping the red light my husband told me that if you stop past the white line even if you did not cross the intersection the sensor will detect your car as beating the red light is it true thank you for your enlightenment nina 
and why will you take risk the cam only flash i u cross the line when there is red signal img nid 21285 title desc link none align left width height 0 
why people are crossing red signals on doha roads i think signals are changing quickly than on dubai roads and its hard for the motorists to control their vehicles moreover motorists are bit panic fearing the penalties as per the new traffic law 
this is a big problem which needs to be addressed by authorities real soon 
omg we received two tickets from the traffic department both because we didn 39 t wait the green light now we have to pay 3000qr is always that expensive never ever again i will do it even if i have to wait 10 minutes in front of the red light without one car around me why i didn 39 t know before about the camera on the lights 
now you know what the colored lights at intersections are for you can always check your traffic violations at http www e gov qa egovportal index jsp 
is it just me or does anyone else who drives here end up a complete stressball because of all the reckless drivers on the qatar roads do people actually take driving lessons here seriously i have never seen a learner vehicle between lane hopping no indication and speeding my blood pressure must be sky high 
as per your profile you are a member of ql for almost two years and it is strange that you are posting about driving in qatar now 
yesterday was driving the guy infront of me stopped at the green light for no reason and instead of hitting him in the back directly i swerved to the right and damaged my car if i hit him straight the airbag would have opened and damaged me since i wasnt wearing a seatbelt any idea how much this would cost to fix 
next time wear a seat belt 
hi ql members is there any cameras in roundabouts when i m with my friend in the car always see him beating the redlight on the roundabouts thanks

we have been invited to a qatari wedding this thursday and apart from not knowing anyone as my husband will be on the men s party and i will be at the women s party to state the obvious i have no idea what to expect and what the customs are what should i wear do we bring a gift what happens during a wedding i am very honored to have been invited but terrified of making a fool of my self 
qatari wedding gents section there sure will be two diff section one each for ladies and gents the practice is to greet the groom and his family elders first then be seated in the hall red tea arabic coffee will be served will be called for the buffet dinner have dinner and say good bye and thanks to the groom n the family member and leave ladies not sure about the custom dg amensia might help ps be sure not to use mobile camera phones 
not sure if this is the right section of site to post in but have just seen this thread on expatwoman http www expatwoman com forum messages aspx topicid 69168 and want to know what rules are these are they new how bloody daft are they considering nightclubs etc should i buy an abaya next time i want a nice dinner at w s thanks 
here s the content of the thread you are probably all aware by now that there are new dress regulations in place in qatar the 4 and 5 star hotels were given 10 days to comply with the new rules which are that you must be appropriately dressed no explanation of what this is but it seems to be no knees even at night in nightclubs etc and no shoulders i ve heard of people being refused entry to restaurants for having slits up their dresses and in the case of a 14 year old showing their knees i ve been told the shopping centres are also now turning people away for wearing halter necks etc landmark in particular one friend just rang me to say that a group of her girlfriends were stopped from going into w last weekend each of them had something inappropriate from cleavage to knees to shoulders you also have to now show either your id card or passport for entry into bars and the scary part if you are n t dressed appropriately they take your id card and scan it and send 
any advice on where to buy maternity clothes so far the few malls i ve looked has either a terrible selection i e a selection of 3 different items or the prices are out of control i m to the point of buying online and paying to ship any ideas please serious comments only i m in no mood for sarcastic silly male humor this morning 
hi minoush i think you probably tried these shops already ie mothercare marks and spencer bhs next yup selection is awful and prices are ouch have you tried h m they did have many trousers price range was 160 250qar the other thing to do would be to invest in good pair of basic colour trousers and get your tops stitched 
hi guys i m just doing a bit of research and i d like to find out your opinions on some of the nightclubs here in doha which one s do you think are the best why which one s are the worst why and what kind of night club would you like to see open in doha cheers 
lots of sexy pretty women just call me tigasin that s what i m talking about 
o k i am frustrated and need some seasoned advice what are the most important things i should pack in luggage i do n t know if i can even wear half of the clothes i have here in florida suggestions i am packing right now and it is 2 45 a m help did i say i need assistance 
pack as much as u can coz u can wear pretty much anything sanz 
who according to you is the greatest superhero and why 
superman coz i like the way he wears tat red underwear up of tat blue dress i wish to dress like him in public and in my office 
okay im not sure if this is appropiate as i am not trying to offend anyone but i keep hearing some middle eastern people tell me that the qatari weddings are known for getting down and dirty behind all these smiles no one tells me what this means what the heck happens at these weddings i would really like to know 
i ve only been to one but if you mean dull as dogshit when you say down and dirty than i guess thats right the parties are separated into two groups men and women and there is no alcohol at least at the womens parties they dance to loud disco music and dress scantily for other women while critizing what every other woman is wearing not exactly the greatest party of all time 
why most of the european women are not properly dressing are they feeling some sort of satisfaction to express themselves it is also imitated by asians nowadays only for your comments pls 
most based on which wide sweeping survey or are you talking about european women in europe where they are free to dress however the heck they feel like 
hi all me and some friends from london are looking to come over to doha for a couple of weeks whats the party scene like on friday and saturday nights i hear that in qatar nobody goes out on saturday is that true where would you go for rnb and hiphop and ive heard alot about a club called qube is it any good any feedback would be welcome thanks 
if you enjoy filipino cover bands and lots of asian variety in the crowd then the qube is great however if you enjoy more of the western flair you are down to garvey s rugby club and rydges of these your best bet for fri and sat night my opinion so no flames from anyone is going to be rydges the bar is under new aussie management with the goal of much better music and faster service this past weekend was quite busy and the music was good enough to dance to so there you hav it one recommendation

can you deferentiate the difference between loving a person and liking a person 
i like you too much i love you whats the difference why most of the guys ca n t accept the word love and prefers to say like instead 
why do people ask this question every week 
i love the beaches i love dune buggies on the sand dunes i love the souqs i love the villagio lol and i love in general love the weather yes i know that is crazy lol 
i love the fact that none of my relatives are here 
is it possible to love more than one person at the same time i mean a woman loves more than a man or a man loves more than a woman i mean by love this thing that we all feel inside anybody can define the love i hope that i could delivered the idea very well 
anyone who tells u they can define love is a damn lair love is n t something definite and noone can tell u what it is u can only feel it and u feel it differently towards different people i mean u love ur friend in a different way than ur fiancee for example so in that aspect yes u can love more than one person at the same time in different ways 
what do you prefer dogs or cats i am not so fond of animals inside my house but my son is crazy about pets i have a parrot dog fostering an aquarium full of fishes i like cats but dogs i don t like them licking me or coming near me but most people i know love dogs why do some people like dogs and others like cats 
ooops last line i meant why do some people not animals lol mods please correct my mistake 
what are the pet rules in qatar i mean can we take our pets out in the city or in the car

i think the shopping malls in qatar are carefully designed and allow families to have sometime together away from the scorching sun however it appears the body odour emanating from some of the people you meet in these malls is really awful is it because those people do n t bath well and or frequently or is it due to the weather conditions ewww 
going malls without taking a bath is one of our rights in qatar

dear all can you please advice where in doha can you find plus sized clothes apart from splash and evans 
which shops sell plus size clothes in doha i find that there is very little selection for clothing and footwear for the tall females especially if they are overweight too yesterday i found some stretching clothes for myself but came back and found my daughter who is 4o kgs less than me comfortably wearing them i dont mind handing them all over to her if i find few for myself somewhere 
plus size women there is also a place in villagio can not tell you the name but its near the gondola entrance hope this helps 
any advice on where to buy maternity clothes so far the few malls i ve looked has either a terrible selection i e a selection of 3 different items or the prices are out of control i m to the point of buying online and paying to ship any ideas please serious comments only i m in no mood for sarcastic silly male humor this morning 
hi minoush i think you probably tried these shops already ie mothercare marks and spencer bhs next yup selection is awful and prices are ouch have you tried h m they did have many trousers price range was 160 250qar the other thing to do would be to invest in good pair of basic colour trousers and get your tops stitched 
yesterday i went to villagio and noticed that dresses for fat people is so bad and so shapless that if they wear they ll look more fat and it gives a look of old fashioned texture and style why like this

dear ql community do you think it would be a good idea considering recent moderation if our dear mods were to give us the actual users of ql us who keep this site going a list of what is acceptable to post on ql and what is not i do realize that we have been kindly given ql guidelines never the less in light of recent happenings i think a list with all bad and all good topics listed would be very helpful to all of us what do you think

i would love to hear from you why after so many years palestine has been admitted as an observing un member why now is there a motive dodgy behind this does palestine include gaza or it is just the west bank i would love to hear it from you ordinary guys not from the news m e experts political pundits etc 
it is really complicated palestine is probably the most prominent indicator of how unjust the world is being lead by politics and power to your point i would say it is due to the evolution of the political scene and the behaviour of the zionist regime which pushed it into isolation to the point where they could not get adequate votes among un member states additionally west is a bit tired of supporting the zionist s states and cleaning up its miss so they want to have some stability the west was a key player in creating the zionist state but they did not have the same intention zionist s had my thought anyway interesting topic 
a woman s greatest weapon is her tears well based on experienced its effective for me because everytime me my husband got a small misunderstanding or fight even if his too angry with me once i cried he will be the one to say sorry i will not do it again pls dont cry even if its my fault lol 
i dont agree you ladies always cry i dont speak till she dont stop to cry lol drink beer save water

i was very interested when i first ql i thought it is nice site but sorry to say the site is more rejecting than welcoming to new ppl or even to old members but not as popular as other ql big names posts are getting so silly no attractive posts ppl are divided into groups please leaders of ql try to drag ql from being another useless site thanks 
most of the time i am a peeping tom here reading comments and views in a forum those views and comments help me a lot with my everyday living here in qatar but recently there are comments which are beyond human constraint i guess all of us here joined ql to make friends not enemies i want to ask each and every member of this community why you joined ql

i was wondering is there any clique caucus wroking inside the ql when passing remarks about a post my last post is poetry boring did not invite some of the famous names in ql who used to comment anything under the sun was it a post which does not invite attention or they ignored it in a chauvinist way surprising 
those who are intersted in poetry will comment on that its not mandatory to comment on boring threads 
qlers how would you feel if suddenly a message will flash on screen advising us that qatar living will be shutting down in a matter of days 
i hope it wo n t happen qling is a my habbit here 
it seems that most posts these days are copy paste jobs of upsetting sad negative news from newspapers is this all we can come up with where are happy and cheerful news and posts i miss those days

doha to dubai first you can ship one of the cars i am told it will cost about 2k qar aed you will need to get a transit visa for the drive through saudi and for this you will need a valid gcc residence visa aside from this i would have thought that you just register the car with the ministry of transportation once you are here but not sure if that involves anything different than what you would need for a car bought here if your car is too old you wo n t be able to register it in doha i think 2006 models are the oldest allowed this year no idea about the stuff but good question i wanted to do the same it would not have occurred to me that this might be a problem

if you enjoy filipino cover bands and lots of asian variety in the crowd then the qube is great however if you enjoy more of the western flair you are down to garvey s rugby club and rydges of these your best bet for fri and sat night my opinion so no flames from anyone is going to be rydges the bar is under new aussie management with the goal of much better music and faster service this past weekend was quite busy and the music was good enough to dance to so there you hav it one recommendation 
hi will be comin 2 doha soon jus wanted 2 know hows the nightlife in doha r there pubs discos here r there a lot of bars or is it true that there r bars only in the 5 star hotels will i get 2 c belly dancin anywhere in doha

hey guys have you been to cube i think its cool its just at the back of ramada hotel its like a night club though i think its hard to get inside especially on thursday night i just found last night while making a detour you know the traffic while i was driving i see this long line little did i know its a line to get inside this new club do you think its own by ramada hotel anyway its a good thing they are already permitting building clubs 
i went tuesday i thaught it was pretty poor tbh lots of working women and a bad philipino coversband playing rock ballards of the 80s the design is interesting nothing like a propper nightclub far too bright no disco lighting very restrictive about upstairs couples vip area it reminded me of nightclubs you see in american movies pretty synthetic and fake i couldnt work out the booze pricing policy a bourbon and coke cost the same price as a coke and everyone from work had rank hangovers despite quitting at 11 30 yes its owned and staffed by ramada 
hello friends this is nir can anyone help me to find a indian bar in qatar thank you

hi i was recently in abu dhabi for 4 months i really enjoyed my time there although there is little to do in the blistering heat i did enjoy my weekends out and the nightlife there i am now in cairo and have disliked every minute i have the oportunity to come to doha and wonder what the nightlife is like there how does doha compare with abu dhabi cheers jim

horses for courses abu dhabi and qatar are similar abu dhabi is a lot more congested and trying to move towards being on par with dubai probably more social outlets things to do in abu dhabi and surrounding area

hi i am interested to migrate to canada appreciate if any one can recomend me a good migration consultants in qatar is it advisable to process my application through them or can i do it on my own thanks a lot 
contact canadian embassy in abu dhabi and ask for reference you need to have valid agent for this thing too many crooks going on be carefull and hope you can get your green card everybody is right everybody is wrong it depend where we stand 
anybody know an agency here in qatar where people can apply for canada what is the best and fastest process in migrating there please advice thanks 
honestly if you can do the applications alone the lawyers arent any faster you just have to be persistant lawyers will tell you that they have a special arrangmenet but it is baloney diplomacy is the art of saying nice doggie until you can find a rock will rogers 
q234 
i do n t understand the question surely you must have decided before you apply why you want to go to a particular country if it is just to have a western passport who cares canada is cold for much of the year austalia is warmer but has some hotspots sometimes this is not a very specific question to be honest if you are going to any other country other than to reside there permanently you are not emigrating for legitimate reasons you are emigrating to get the passport what is the matter with your birth country s passport 
please advise i have this good idea to process my immigration request as a skilled worker to either canada or australia kindly advise me which among the two countries you would recommend please further since the immigration process is never easy do i need a lawyer for the assistance please so to go through comfortably without issue please advise 
a word from the wise your english is lacking you may want to do something about that before you apply 
dear you please i would kindly request for more advise and knowledge regarding immigration to canada i have approached a lawyer and he informed me that i have qualified for canadian immigration as a skilled proffessional he mentioned about qeubec immigration please do you have some information about this place can i settle with my family at alberta or ontario city with this residence permit guide me please 
the best option to search the net and to check out the canadian immigration site www cic gc ca english index asp they have all the necessary information there good luck 
dears i m a filipino currently working here in ras laffan industrial city my sister is in canada and she advised me to acquire the police clearance here in qatar for future reference when i will be migrating also my questions 1 what are the requirements to process a qatar police clearance 2 what are the steps to follow thank you regards bonjiek1981 
the requirements is your passport and qatar id only then just fill up the application on their office you also need a picture 2 pcs thats all 
this is for my brother who is working as an it professional in dubai he is planning to migrate to canada or australia but he is still not sure where to migrate i would really appreciate if somebody who has experience in this could give valuable suggestions is canada or australia a better place to migrate pls give ur valuable advices and suggestions 
trust me on this stay in the gulf and make lots money i know lots of people who left good positions and jobs here just to experience the whole canada life and then started repenting so unless u have truck loads of money dont think of migrating to these places  smoke  
i met one of the person here in qatar through the gulf times advertisement recruiting the skilled workers to canada the recruiter company name is m98world how i wil check whether this one is fake or not they are asking for 1500 qr for the visa processing also they inform as this process will take 10 months after the registration so any one have any idea to verify this recruitment there office is located just opposite side of the al safa hotel near the jaida bridge 
hello for my information canada immigration process takes from 2 to 3 years minimum also required some skills ielts 6 and bank credit etc so take care 
we re interested in having our baby in canada i d like to see if anyone out there has done it too 
there is no such thing as birth tourism in canada in fact you will probably either be denied a visa or turned away at immigration if there is any suspicion that you are there solely to give birth this is an immigration scam because canada confers nationality on children born in canada but reserves the right to deport the parents be very careful there have been cases where the baby gets to stay but the parents have to leave 
i want to go to canada for job how can i begin my process here in qatar anybody can suggest me 
how did you reach qatar use the same process

ok guys i am going to prehaps ticks someone off again but i have a question not sunny but me will a qatari man go out with a western christian girl have sex with her and then move on because he think women from the west are wild and sex craved sunny has received quite a bit response from qatari men who want to date her once we arrive i even got an offer myself but i believe it is a trap and i tell sunny be careful any advice out there 
it is a very rare qatari man that would want anything more than what you just described it is a very rare man in qatar that wants anything more to do with a western girl than you just described meeting men here is like stepping through a minefield 9 out of 10 of them just want sex and they will do and say anything to get it from you i am not bitter i do not hate men but i have been living in various parts of asia for the last 2 and a half years trust me when i say if you do not want to get burned be very careful who you date asian opinion of western women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating tell sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first

okay im not sure if this is appropiate as i am not trying to offend anyone but i keep hearing some middle eastern people tell me that the qatari weddings are known for getting down and dirty behind all these smiles no one tells me what this means what the heck happens at these weddings i would really like to know 
i ve only been to one but if you mean dull as dogshit when you say down and dirty than i guess thats right the parties are separated into two groups men and women and there is no alcohol at least at the womens parties they dance to loud disco music and dress scantily for other women while critizing what every other woman is wearing not exactly the greatest party of all time

hi can you please give us some backgrounds regarding doha s lifestyle in terms of cost of living and quality of education i m a nurse by profession are there many career oppotunities for me as well we have plans in joining my husband in doha with my 8 y o son what s your advice thanks 
i have been offered jobs both in dubai and in doha i will be visiting in sept to look at both places and form an opinion for myself i get the impression the lifestyle is better in qatar less traffic easier to move around etc accomadation is cheaper in dubai can you give me your pro s and cons on both places appreciated jr 
qatar is less developed than dubai but it s on the rise and will be a large construction site for the next decade accommodation is just as expensive in dubai if not a little more qatar is a less hectic place than dubai if you do a search qatar dubai on this forum you can get an idea of what has been said in the past 
i know this may be a biased question in a qatar forum but honestly what s your advice for someone having 2 quasi similar offers one in doha and 1 in abu dhabi and of course mutually exclusive 
horses for courses abu dhabi and qatar are similar abu dhabi is a lot more congested and trying to move towards being on par with dubai probably more social outlets things to do in abu dhabi and surrounding area 
does anyone prefer one over the other and why thanks

i will personally make up flasks of tea after iftar and take biscuits to the traffic police so they will enforce the rules and do n t need to go off and get a cuppa i am sure i am not the only person really hoping that these rules will be enforced to the max terramax i totally agree 
i am wondering if i can open a bank account as i am on visit visa 
seems like all the banks need the salary to be credited to their accounts where i came from that was not a necessity so it sort of limits my choices can anyone recommend me a bank that has good interest rates on loans and credit cards so far i m considering doha bank because of the lulu card is it worth it

we are relocating from south africa in july and i have literally applied to all the british and american schools for my 4 years son and been refused by each of them we have however been lucky to get a spot at acs doha i know its a new school but has anyone heard anything about it and is there confirmation of whether they follow american or british curriculum 
as you say it s a new school so it s difficult to confirm anything i believe the buildings are not yet 100 complete but it s nothing for you to worry about since the school year will only start in september good luck with the move and with the heat when you get here 
i 39 m moving to doha soon for five months initially though it 39 s possible i may settle long term i 39 d like some advice on any good gyms in doha i can 39 t seem to get any comprehensive information on the net i 39 d like a pool sauna gym and a climbing wall would be a big plus any ideas or recommendations how much would it cost thanks for any help you can give me 
there are a couple of pure gyms i know of sas gym and gold s gym this one you may not know of it unless you are american which cater for the gym freaks the latter gym i believe is spoofed in dodgeball w ben stiller and will farrell however there are a few that are health clubs which is what you are after in your description they are al dana club diplomatic club doha club but closing soon and clubs in major hotels intercon ramada ritz sheraton etc plus al sharq ritz carlton opening soon and some other hotels i think most are pretty full prices for singles range from 3000qr to 8000qr per year appr do not know of any with climbing walls can i ask do the numerous stadiums have gyms that can be used also somewhere like aspire can you use any of the facilities there plus many housing compunds have all these facilities the quality depends on the compund offcourse some are real nice such as mirage al fardan beverly hills tbah etc some not so 
damn the beach besides the intercontinental has been closed the area has been set aside for a housing project why ca n t doha a seaside capital city of an aspiring tourism hub not have at least one beach it was so popular amongst the residents the same had happened to the one near the old doha club does anyone know any good beaches near the city limits

ok guys i am going to prehaps ticks someone off again but i have a question not sunny but me will a qatari man go out with a western christian girl have sex with her and then move on because he think women from the west are wild and sex craved sunny has received quite a bit response from qatari men who want to date her once we arrive i even got an offer myself but i believe it is a trap and i tell sunny be careful any advice out there 
it is a very rare qatari man that would want anything more than what you just described it is a very rare man in qatar that wants anything more to do with a western girl than you just described meeting men here is like stepping through a minefield 9 out of 10 of them just want sex and they will do and say anything to get it from you i am not bitter i do not hate men but i have been living in various parts of asia for the last 2 and a half years trust me when i say if you do not want to get burned be very careful who you date asian opinion of western women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating tell sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first 
recently i heard that qcb has instructed to reduce the loan interest to 6 for the new and existing loan holders any update on this i am hsbc customer and still they deduct same amount any info from when this will effect and it is mandatory to all the banks as i heard from my friend qnb already confirm they reduce the interest therefore loan repayment period has reduce what a relief if this true 
dear ql members it is very surprising that hsbc is still not reducing their personal loan interest rate while othe banks have been implementing 5 0 1 5 loan policy as per qatar central banks regulations as far as i know hsbc should have recalculated personal loans back and front calculations abiding the new qcb regulations any idea on this 
i hope they hsbc qatar do it soon so even i can benefit from this

hi i ll be moving to doha for work and would like to use hsbc qatar for my banking since i m already using them in my home country are those using their services in qatar may i check are their services good and speedy are charges reasonable it s expensive here do they have extensive atm do they pay interests for our saving how about their premier a c is it worth opening such a c thanks f co a little progress everyday adds up to big results 
hsbc qatar is ok service is ok and fee of qar 70 per month is reasonable internet banking not bad at all not sure about premier account status acc works well for me

my wife and i are moving to qatar in october from the usa texas she is a bit concerned on what is proper dress for women we have been told that anything is fine as long as her sholders are covered and her knees she is very upset about having to cover up when its 115 degrees outside what is acceptable 
as a woman here in qatar i encountered the same problem when i moved here last year i was told long sleeves and long skirts that is not entirely true esp in the summer when the heat is unbearable your wife can wear capris knees do need to be covered and short sleeved tops as long as the neckline is n t too low the benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants the general rule is that it should n t be too tight or two revealing also keep in mind that they run the a c on high everywhere so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants malls etc you are arriving in october so the weather will be fine like spring weather in the states very pleasant actually last winter it actually got quite cold here so bring jackets and even a light weight winter coat or heavier if you intend to travel during winter one other option a number of western women do wear abayas aro 
any advice on where to buy maternity clothes so far the few malls i ve looked has either a terrible selection i e a selection of 3 different items or the prices are out of control i m to the point of buying online and paying to ship any ideas please serious comments only i m in no mood for sarcastic silly male humor this morning 
hi minoush i think you probably tried these shops already ie mothercare marks and spencer bhs next yup selection is awful and prices are ouch have you tried h m they did have many trousers price range was 160 250qar the other thing to do would be to invest in good pair of basic colour trousers and get your tops stitched 
i m moving to doha soon and expecting is mothercare there the same as in the uk so i should be able to buy everything i need at a reasonable price i d be happy to find any decent alternative stores too thanks 
not only mothercare but there are more similar shops where you can buy what ever you want 
my family and i are new here i packed lightly for my stay with the intent to purchase a burqa for my outings out of respect for the culture however i am surprised to find so many women not wearing them is there a need as long as i am dressed conservatively or are those not wearing them being disrespectful and simply tolerated 
hi go as per what your mind says 
where can i buy good quality indian party wear in doha i found bombay house to be too expensive also they have very limited selection please advise

i have heard that it 39 s really fun to drive from qatar to dubai on the weekend obviosly if you have a 4 x 4 drive my question is do i need to get a visa if i want to go to dubai if i have a residence permit of qatar 
although you can go to dubai and get visa on arrival if you are going by air but road travel is different you have to pass saudi border and you need saudi visa in order to get saudi visa you have to get uae visa first saudi gives visa only after you already have uae visa on your passport hope this clarifies 
im a medical specialist by profession and qatar resident travelling with my wife and baby to dubai will i and my family get on arrival visa in dubai is it true that fly dubai wont allow us to board the flight from doha as we dont have a pre arranged visa i have already booked fly dubai ticket for all us online what should be my next step waiting for answers from experienced travellers thank you 
i dont know if your profession qualifies for a visa on arrival but there is no problem flying with fly dubai and taking a visa on arrival i had been to dubai last month with my wife and had no problems getting a visa on arrival 
the air fare other related services are quite affordable is n t it http flydubai com you can check the details here http www gulf times com site topics article asp cu 2 item 318545 version 1 template 36 parent 16

its illegal to stay as together as long as you are married and the visa you can get from any of the hotles only no personal visas until you have a marriage certi or else a job visa qatar is strict and you need to abide with the rules always 
i see the prices for qatar airways are stupidly high again and almost 40 more than emirates when will they come down again before the summer or will they continue to rise obvioulsy qatar airways now think they can charge stupid prices as they are the best 5 airline in economy 
a couple of weeks ago they were low for flights til the end of the year but now they ve suddenly jumped up again very annoying but it s not just qr that do this all airlines do do n t make it personal

does anyone have any experience at any massage parlour in doha where 39 s the best place for gent 39 s massage and what 39 s the range of the price like massage for men are all done by men i 39 ve seen mushrooming number of gents saloons in qatar do they normally offer massage service or just hair cut 
i think saloons usually if they are of the 1950s barber look they offer a head massage shave and haircut for 15 20 qr albeit i have never had the full tratment myself so cant advise which one there are so many anyway what is the deal with them calling them saloon did they think a salon is for women and since they had seen western films i e cowboy ones with men going into saloons that is the male name equivelant and everyone else has followed suit since nice man saloon pretty saloon and my favourite boeuty something like that saloon the last one would be a good name for a strpiclub cum nightclub about massage parlours i think most of them are men2men but there are a few exceptions check with the major hotels 
i have 5000 qr and i would really love to travel somewhere other than qatar and bahrain does anyone have experience traveling from qatar to somewhere nice i would like to have full information on cost places etc thank you very much

well the name speaks for itself really how many people have you met in person or gotten to know from qatar living 
if you havent met anyone why not is it because your bad at socialising you dont want anyone to know who you really are or your just too busy when you find yourself in a desperate situation oh forget it zada 
is there an avatar that comes up on ql that makes your heart beat just a little bit faster is there someone that you have never met but you are so intrigued by their writng style that you just have to read everything they post do you have a picture in your mind of that person and you want to see if you are right c mon lets have a little fun on this thursday morning who is the anonymous qler who holds intrigue for you 
well i have seen you mate but the one in display pic of urs i havent seen her who is she img nid 73057 title desc link none align left width height 0 
whom should a mother choose when it comes to decide between money or son 
if she chooses money over her son she is no longer a mother to the son how could any mother want money over her own child what a horrible position this is

i have learned that ql is not a dating site 
seriously what do you want attention praise why do you feel the need to bother ql 
stop sending me threatening pm s tra la la 
can any body tell me where all the qatar living members meet on holidays how to find them

hi everyone very nice to meet you all my wife and i are moving to doha in about 3 weeks as i m going to be working most days my wife and i are a little concerned about what she ll be able to do to keep her occupied during the day we were thinking of getting her enrolled at an esl school she does n t speak much english besides take courses what do other non expat spouses do to keep busy thanks everyone hope to meet some of you after we arrive 
hi nice to meet you hope your move goes well it can be difficult finding things to occupy your time here especially when you re new i m not sure where you re going to be living i live in an apartment block with my husband and it has no communal areas so have found it hard to meet and get to know my neighbours i think compound life is a bit more sociable anyway a couple of ideas the intercontinental hotel the one near katara not intercont the city has a special offer on tuesdays and wednesdays ladies pay only 50 qr to access their pool pool area i take yoga classes with yama yoga http yamayogastudios com they are lovely and might be another way to meet people also not sure what nationality language your wife speaks but there are a number of associations for different nationalities here buy a copy of marhaba magazine when you arrive they have an up to date list of them with contact details so she could socialise with people who speak her language 
hi getting ready for the move over and i was wondering if anyone has any tips on things you really can not get in doha that at home is just readily available someone mentioned cough syrup and tampons anything esle 
i am getting mis cals from 224 55201665 and other numbers but when i tried to call no reply can any body tell me is it any scam call or what any one else facing this problem what to do kindly help me

any idea how the elder tree nursery at hilal is do they have enough activities for the kids or is it tv all the time and how are the teachers and class assistants are the kids given enough attention to i was thinking of sending my 2 year old there but i heard a few uncomplimentary things bout the nursery lately so would like some feedback on the same 
he was in the older class they did lots of activities in the morning they did turn the tv on in the afternoon half the kids were asleep then and so it was to keep the others quiet while they waited for the moms to come pick them up they also had educational computer games for them to play if they did not want to watch tv i thought the teachers were just fine and really doted on the children i was happy with the place

recently i spotted a post about aramex and thought it was a neat service my husband however was less than impressed saying we could use fed ex or dhl if you like aramex what are the pros over other companies also if anyone s sent received time sensitive documents through this company i d like to know how your experience went thanks 
i ve sent n received too many times with all of them each time i experienced to send sensetive papers as you meantioned but what i noticed that dhl is the fastest one incase you have limited time n hurry for something and as a personal view i say all are safe enough and well servicing the worse thing is you have to pick up ur stuff from their office after they informed u that you have a shipment would be better if they could delivery at the door wish you the best
