# MappSent: <span> ## a Textual Mapping Approach for Question-to-Question Similarity</span>

We introduce **MappSent**, a novel approach for textual similarity. Based on a linear sentence embedding representation, its principle is to build a matrix that __maps sentences in a joint-subspace__ where similar sets of sentences are pushed closer. We evaluate our approach on  the SemEval 2016/2017 question-to-question similarity task and show that overall MappSent  achieves competitive results and outperforms in most cases state-of-art methods.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment
