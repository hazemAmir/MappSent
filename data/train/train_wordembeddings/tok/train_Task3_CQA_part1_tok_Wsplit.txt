hey guys i m a nurse here in the phils i just signed a contract for hamad as a staff nurse the offer is 5600 qatar riyals per month plus 1000 qatar riyal for transportation allowance is that a great deal how about the free accommodation does it look good i m anxious about my new job help pls 
regarding the starting salary if it is your 1st stint to work as nurse overseas that looks to be fair with regard to the transportation allowance of qr1 000 month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital are located in the same city i mean if you will be assigned in al khor or somewhere far and your accomodation is in doha then that might need to be adjusted hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff gets housing allowance i am not a nurse but i know some nurse working with hamad hamad is a government hospital and in general they give higher salary than the private clinics hospitals can you provide me hamad s agency and contact address in the philippines as it could also be an option for my nurse daughter in the future she just passed the nursing board exam and barely starting her 1st job this month

have any expats on this forum either bought property in qatar or considered buying and then rejected i e zig zag towers the pearl etc i m trying to evaluate whether or not this would be a good investment what do you think are the potential risks and upsides if you have bought what was your experience of the process and in hindsight was it a good decision regards 
personally i think the real estate industry may start a down slide soon it seems like rents have skyrocketed within the last year or two it is likely that the asian games had soemthing to do with this and i just can not imagine the prices of real estate maintaining this insane rate for much longer something has to give on the flip side of the coin qatar has been and still is expanding at a fast rate there could continue to be a growth spurt and that would mean that more housing would be needed for workers i m absolutly no help am i lol sorry

okay girls this is a doubt that has been bugging me since quite some time i ve been using this particular shampoo since a few months it promises to give health and shine to hair but there are other shampoos which give bounce strength volume etc is it okay if i mix a couple of shampoos and use i asked one of my friends and she says it s not advisable what do y all think 
my stylist actually recommends that i change shampoos every once in a while the reasoning is that your hair becomes used to the particular shampoo and looses a bit of it effectiveness i mix shampoos i generally use moisturizing but i do use a clarifying shampoo for a week or so every couple of months did your friend say why you shouldnt use different shampoos diplomacy is the art of saying nice doggie until you can find a rock will rogers

http forum santabanta com showthread htm t 146018 guys above link is about end of the world by dec 21 2012 is it true any proof with anybody out there 
massively on history channel and natgeo multiple times there are many theories which support this 1 the concept of the mayan doomsday prophesies matches with that of the chinese yin yan and nostradamaus and they all agree that 21 st dec 2012 is the doomsday 2 astrologers and astronomers agree with the geophysicsts that this particular day is of an extra ordinary importance in terms of celestial alignment of the sun with the thirteenth sign of the astrology and might cause unpredictable results which might be catastrophic i think we will have to wait till the day itself to find out but undoubtely it is one of the most striking theories on doomsday source a study conducted by friedunicorn vol i september 1999

hi everyone my husband has just got a job with qatar airways and i m hoping to get my three children into a british school in doha in september 2012 i need a place in year 3 year 2 and reception can anybody advise on how likely that is i m not sure if i should stay in the uk until i can get the children into a school or could that be a really long wait any information would be greatly received many thanks xx 
wait and only apply to doha english speaking school if they get accepted then leave the uk this school is only british school which follow the actual british curriculum and is monitored by the british educational council all the rest of the british school claim they follow the british curriculum who is there to monitor the school if you pay for a private company to accredit the school they will come out and give you accreditation you will find out that your child will be a year behind because majority of the schools do n t have the textbooks for each subject in the class nor do they have a curriculum without textbooks or manuals sadly the teachers have to deal with the parents as to why their child is behind because the principal will pond you over to the teacher for any complaints

hi all my wife is nearly to give birth and i am wondering which is the best clinic hospital in qatar some people are considering that hamad is the best other al ahly other clinic al doha please can you share with us your idea and experience and give us advice thanks in advance 
is there any private clinic in qatar or hospital that i can give birth which cost only 10 000 riyal cause my doctor said if i give birth in doha clinic it will cause me around 20 000 to 25 000 riyal i dont want in hamad hospital so pls can u suggest other private hospital that will cost me less thank you 
hamad is the best you wont be charged much they will charge you only for the room why not you go there 
hello i m 4 months pregnant and i have been seeing dr najla at al ahli hospital i plan to give birth there and i really aprecciate some considerations from women who had delivered there how was the deliver it was normal labour or c section are the nurses well prepared to take care of the babies please any information will be very important thanks 
please consider hamad medical hospital they are much more experienced and prepared 
hello i am from doha and want to know about giving birth here i am pregnant now i need to know how much will be the cost for delivery in hmc doha clinic or al ahli any help will be greatly appreciated as i need to make a choice if i want to go india i hope you all will help me regarding this matter 
this has been discussed lots of times earlier suggest u use the search button for more info n opinions regarding paying at hamad u pay only 100 riyals per day the private hospitals charge arnd 8000 riyals n more for ceasarean lots of people say hamad is not good but i had my baby girl there 6mnths ago and found it quite good have a healthy n enjoyable pregnancy 
has anyone given birth to either hospital by normal delivery or cesarian thanks for sharing your experience good or bad 
i highliy recommend hmc they seem to be the only hospital with full readiness to any complications a friend of mine his wife gave birth at al ahli then immediatly they sent her on an ambulance to hmc as they did not know how to deal with some complications go for hmc bad service i know but at least reliable diagnosis and treatment 
does anybody has an idea the cost of c section in private hospital in doha we are entitled to hamad al khor but recently i got sick for 2 weeks and soon after it was my pregnancy that was affected i am thinking of opting to a private hospital for better care but this time we will have to cover for all the expenses thanks in advance for your help 
a c section in a private hospital can cost you anywhere from 8k to 14k riyals if you have insurance read the terms properly you may have to pay the insurance company 600 1000 qr depends on the policy also they have a limit for the insurance amount and if the cost is more than the one mentioned then you have to shell out the excess

hi all i 39 m a newbie here a malaysian guy in aviation and seriously considering a career with qatar airways i am an experienced cabin crew are there any qatar airways expat crew out there willing to share sum tips or experiences about working with qatar airways 
cactiflora if you want my advice try etihad airlines of the uae they are newer and you have much more opportunities if you are experienced you will make cabin manager within a couple of years its true that qr pay a little more than etihad but etihad just recently raised their duty allowance to abou us 150 per day you are also given the option of taking cash instead of accommodation and transport but the overriding factor in my opinion is that qr is awful when it comes to customer service and this reputation is spreading 
i have recently attended interviews for qatar airways and am waiting to hear back if i am successful have been doing a little research on forums and am getting aloooot of bad feedback about working for the airline anyone who has recent experience or currently work there who can give me their opinion am i better off waiting for emirates or etihad

my wife and i are moving to qatar in october from the usa texas she is a bit concerned on what is proper dress for women we have been told that anything is fine as long as her sholders are covered and her knees she is very upset about having to cover up when its 115 degrees outside what is acceptable 
as a woman here in qatar i encountered the same problem when i moved here last year i was told long sleeves and long skirts that is not entirely true esp in the summer when the heat is unbearable your wife can wear capris knees do need to be covered and short sleeved tops as long as the neckline is n t too low the benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants the general rule is that it should n t be too tight or two revealing also keep in mind that they run the a c on high everywhere so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants malls etc you are arriving in october so the weather will be fine like spring weather in the states very pleasant actually last winter it actually got quite cold here so bring jackets and even a light weight winter coat or heavier if you intend to travel during winter one other option a number of western women do wear abayas aro 
sorry for the ignorant question but i need to know before i move to qatar if wearing makeup is frowned on or not i ve heard nothing one way or the other but i thought it might be considered immodest for the same reasons as displaying the body or hair like it is for traditional nuns i only wear a little makeup but i do n t want to look like a painted lady to anyone 
i believe that no matter how hard you try you wo n t ever be able to carry off as much makeup as girls here do so do n t worry nobody will think you look painted in fact when i arrived here i felt i was n t wearing enough makeup 
my buddy pajju is in need of a manicure see attached where s the best place

rambee visit aspire and ask about their evening sports activities bring your passport or qatar id because you need to register before you could avail of their multifacted sports activities you pay a minimal fee monthly because aspire is subsidized by the government some sports they have include boxing swimming various ball games yoga and others one good thing about their evening program is that each sports class has a professional instructor dedicated not merely to teach but also to ensure student health and safety i will go to aspire than enrol in any other chic gym here in qatar good luck

hi guys is there any gyms in doha with top quality like holmes place chain i m asking this because i ve been reading quite a few complaints about gym conditions and service level in doha tahnks 
since how long are you working out in gyms seriously speaking i think there is very less body builders in doha and if anyone want to develop their body any small gym is more than enough never love a person you can live with always love a person you can never live without 
hi i will be arriving to doha next week where is there a good gym where i can use a treadmill for running is there usually a limit on running on the treadmill ie 30minutes maximum time is there a gym without these limits i look so much forward to going to doha thomas 
most of the clubs like al dana etc have threadmills usually if it is n t busy they do n t mind you staying on

hi friends can anybody let me know how to go to bahrain by road and how far it is i was told by one of my friend that it is just 400kms away from doha thanks for the replies in advance 
i guess you need to go via saudi since there is no direct road connection between qatar and bahrain 
i m thinking of going to bahrain this weekend the only appropriate flight i could find was us 433 r t on qatar airways ouch is there another way it seems incredible that there is n t a ferry or something but i have never heard of one 
baharin air it cost only qr 400

without the expatriate talent where will economies like qatar and bahrain progress http qatarjournal com articles 07 10 02 1719210 shtml the above article clearly reflects a dilemma favoritism and nepotism is a chief characteristic in the work places in the middle east 
thank god i realized this earlier this is going to happen sooner or later so better get ready we are in a dilemma that our kids grew up in middle east and now they can not go back as they are used to the luxurious life style even if we go back we will not be able to adjust and neither will we get these high paying jobs so what to do and what will our kids do our kids have grown up here and now they are unfit for back home

can my sponsor cancel my visa even without my passport thank you guys 
but do n t know the process it is possible 
hello could anyone help to clarify what sponsorship law is about i only have a vague idea that it restricts you from changing job once you are working for a company in qatar is it correct and complete btw for those who have finished your contract in qatar do you return to your homeland or find another nice land in middle east asia etc for further adventure thanks f co good hotmail com 
it basicly states that you are a slave to your sponsor or his deputy as in my case it sucks man and if you are not coming to a real good job in a respectable place mostly this translates into a place run by non arabs specially egyptians do n t waste your life by coming here hong kong is much better you ca n t change your job buy a car go out of the country open a bank account etc without his consent 
i am currently working here in qatar our employer informed us that they will transfer to contractor with less salary but we have option not to accept but the problem is i have personal loan in one of the bank here in doha what if i will not accept the offer what will happen to me i mean did the bank will force to pay or not 
haha so you want to get away without paying the loan

lebanese and american the world is your oyster people will be fawning over you and you will have a great time o 
where do i pay a speeding ticket fine the www moi gov qa website says that i got my picture taken last month i ve heard that most people do n t pay fines until they come to sell the car i ve also heard that the fine gets increased by 10 for every month it is n t paid i d rather pay now thanks 
you used to be able to pay it online at the e government site but that s been under maintenance for a long time now go to the traffic department either at madinat khalifa or airport to pay you need to renew your car s road permit once a year that s when uou have to do a traffic violations check before they renew the permit fines do n t increase you just have to pay it when your road permit is up or if you re involved in a car accident they check for violations then

here s a simplified correlation be honest and tell the truth no one wants to hear and since no one wants to hear the truth they believe you re just insulting them or taking a shot at them thus they ignore you and if such people in your life are all around you they eventually start ignoring you thus leading to you feeling lonely sad fact of life but true but if its about you i believe you should n t change be the person you are and if you have to change change for the good

any idea how the elder tree nursery at hilal is do they have enough activities for the kids or is it tv all the time and how are the teachers and class assistants are the kids given enough attention to i was thinking of sending my 2 year old there but i heard a few uncomplimentary things bout the nursery lately so would like some feedback on the same 
he was in the older class they did lots of activities in the morning they did turn the tv on in the afternoon half the kids were asleep then and so it was to keep the others quiet while they waited for the moms to come pick them up they also had educational computer games for them to play if they did not want to watch tv i thought the teachers were just fine and really doted on the children i was happy with the place 
one of my friend is working here in qatar for 4 years he is planning to resign and go back to his country of origin he was asking does the company will give any seperation pay if yes how is it to be computed lenght of service or whatsoever 
i am working in qatar on last 6 years my present salary 5000 qr i would like to resign from my job and settle back to my nativ country can u please advise me what kind of benefits i can expect according to qatar labor law is it company can give the gratuity together with monthly salary is it allow by the law here if i go legal action against company any use please advise

if i went for an emergency leave and would like to tender resignation through email is it valid i mean of course 2 year ban shall be applied my question is whether my company can file a absconding case against me please your opininon and advice is appreciated 
not really i mean i do n t think so but i think it s better if you call them and talk to them yourself it s much better and if you were a good employee then they might even provide you with an noc if in case you d like to come back to a different co within the 2 years good luck 
hi im working in qatar for more than a year i started in the company last july 2010 now i want to go back to my country for personal reasons i submitted a resignation letter last sept 6 with a 30 days notice i inform also on my letter that my last day in work is on oct 6 is there any way they will not grant my resignation thanks for the advice 
if you are on a strict 2 year contract then it means that you are resigning early which has a somewhat negative thing against you but if you have been good with your work and your more than 1 year stay had been fruitful to the company it will be much easier to negotiate or talk with your management about your inetention the worst that you can encounter is buy your own ticket but if you have a one year renewable contract then you have the right to go home with your just benefits 
hi i am currently working in a company here in qatar for just a month i have n t taken medical and finger prints yet now one company is offering a good deal and i want to transfer there my question is if i m going to resign from my current company and exit to my country with an exit permit from that company can i come back here in qatar and accept that job offer of the latter company pls advise 
if your residence permit has not been processed and your company does give you exit permit then you should be fine but i am not too sure if they would n t ask for noc i guess it depends on what visa you came here on maybe someone else can advise 
hi all just got news from my agency that i already have a visa and qp already gave me the go signal to resign however just to make sure i think it would be best if i sign the contract first before resigning what do you guys think thanks

hi all me and some friends from london are looking to come over to doha for a couple of weeks whats the party scene like on friday and saturday nights i hear that in qatar nobody goes out on saturday is that true where would you go for rnb and hiphop and ive heard alot about a club called qube is it any good any feedback would be welcome thanks 
if you enjoy filipino cover bands and lots of asian variety in the crowd then the qube is great however if you enjoy more of the western flair you are down to garvey s rugby club and rydges of these your best bet for fri and sat night my opinion so no flames from anyone is going to be rydges the bar is under new aussie management with the goal of much better music and faster service this past weekend was quite busy and the music was good enough to dance to so there you hav it one recommendation 
hi all we are a couple with a 8 months baby that want to move to doha we do n t know nothing about the possible cost of kindergardens or a babysitter at home can you recomend one option or another do you know from where are those possible babysitter and if it is common that they live at home with us or they come every day many thank s 
never leave your kids with a babysitter kindergartens are safer and teach your children various skills and knowledge read the newspapers there have been many issues with nannies abusing the children in their care kindergarten is definately the best bet

okay im not sure if this is appropiate as i am not trying to offend anyone but i keep hearing some middle eastern people tell me that the qatari weddings are known for getting down and dirty behind all these smiles no one tells me what this means what the heck happens at these weddings i would really like to know 
i ve only been to one but if you mean dull as dogshit when you say down and dirty than i guess thats right the parties are separated into two groups men and women and there is no alcohol at least at the womens parties they dance to loud disco music and dress scantily for other women while critizing what every other woman is wearing not exactly the greatest party of all time

okay girls this is a doubt that has been bugging me since quite some time i ve been using this particular shampoo since a few months it promises to give health and shine to hair but there are other shampoos which give bounce strength volume etc is it okay if i mix a couple of shampoos and use i asked one of my friends and she says it s not advisable what do y all think 
my stylist actually recommends that i change shampoos every once in a while the reasoning is that your hair becomes used to the particular shampoo and looses a bit of it effectiveness i mix shampoos i generally use moisturizing but i do use a clarifying shampoo for a week or so every couple of months did your friend say why you shouldnt use different shampoos diplomacy is the art of saying nice doggie until you can find a rock will rogers

it is a very rare qatari man that would want anything more than what you just described it is a very rare man in qatar that wants anything more to do with a western girl than you just described meeting men here is like stepping through a minefield 9 out of 10 of them just want sex and they will do and say anything to get it from you i am not bitter i do not hate men but i have been living in various parts of asia for the last 2 and a half years trust me when i say if you do not want to get burned be very careful who you date asian opinion of western women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating tell sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first

hi all me and some friends from london are looking to come over to doha for a couple of weeks whats the party scene like on friday and saturday nights i hear that in qatar nobody goes out on saturday is that true where would you go for rnb and hiphop and ive heard alot about a club called qube is it any good any feedback would be welcome thanks 
if you enjoy filipino cover bands and lots of asian variety in the crowd then the qube is great however if you enjoy more of the western flair you are down to garvey s rugby club and rydges of these your best bet for fri and sat night my opinion so no flames from anyone is going to be rydges the bar is under new aussie management with the goal of much better music and faster service this past weekend was quite busy and the music was good enough to dance to so there you hav it one recommendation

hey guys i m a nurse here in the phils i just signed a contract for hamad as a staff nurse the offer is 5600 qatar riyals per month plus 1000 qatar riyal for transportation allowance is that a great deal how about the free accommodation does it look good i m anxious about my new job help pls 
regarding the starting salary if it is your 1st stint to work as nurse overseas that looks to be fair with regard to the transportation allowance of qr1 000 month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital are located in the same city i mean if you will be assigned in al khor or somewhere far and your accomodation is in doha then that might need to be adjusted hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff gets housing allowance i am not a nurse but i know some nurse working with hamad hamad is a government hospital and in general they give higher salary than the private clinics hospitals can you provide me hamad s agency and contact address in the philippines as it could also be an option for my nurse daughter in the future she just passed the nursing board exam and barely starting her 1st job this month

hi guys just want to have an idea on how to live there in qatar im from philippines and ill be assigned there in new doha intl airport as a site technician with offer of 3400qr 600qr allowance is it enough for me my co workers said that 600 is good enough for every month hope you can help me out for the cost of living there il be there on or before sept1 2011 guys pls help me give me insights guys on how to survive there 
the cost of living here is quite high but whether your salary is enough would mainly depend on your lifestyle other factors such as whether your company would provide you with accommodation and transportation would be very important as well if you have to pay your accommodation from your own pocket then i m afraid your salary would not be enough 
hi everyone please any1 can help me i need to have an idea how much do private clinics and hospitals offer for filipino nurses i am a nurse and i m going to attend job interviews some days from now i need to have values whenever ask how much do i expect for salary well i need a job as well as respectable salary thank you 
if you follow martin2doha advise definitely i am very sure you will not get the job why because private clinics and private hospitals only offers a salary of 3500 5500 inluding all allowances i am working in government hospitals and i know what are the salary range for the private company

i ve noticed recently around qatar that the rate of western men with asian women is pretty high compared to other places i ve lived in i m just wondering what s up with that do western men over here and everywhere else have a preference towards asian women or is just a coincidence that i see alot of these couples around anyone have any idea 
hehe truth is asian women are prettier though not fairer secondly asian women are trying to escape to the west life is easier for them there 
ok guys i am going to prehaps ticks someone off again but i have a question not sunny but me will a qatari man go out with a western christian girl have sex with her and then move on because he think women from the west are wild and sex craved sunny has received quite a bit response from qatari men who want to date her once we arrive i even got an offer myself but i believe it is a trap and i tell sunny be careful any advice out there 
it is a very rare qatari man that would want anything more than what you just described it is a very rare man in qatar that wants anything more to do with a western girl than you just described meeting men here is like stepping through a minefield 9 out of 10 of them just want sex and they will do and say anything to get it from you i am not bitter i do not hate men but i have been living in various parts of asia for the last 2 and a half years trust me when i say if you do not want to get burned be very careful who you date asian opinion of western women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating tell sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first 
why do you think you only see s asian girls with white guys and never asian guy with white girl why asian girls go for white guys and its so rare to see the other way around is it becuase asian guy are too shy or is it about size and height or maybe you guys have answer to all my questions i just wana know myself coz im not an asian girl 
please specify which asian group you are talking about oriental sub continent or arab i feel your scorn and i accept it jon stewart 
i was working b4 in qatar i left qatar last yr but was n t able to get noc from my company my fiance is qatari but we re planning to get married outside qatar coz we do n t have the approval yet in qatar gov t now my problem is how am i goin to go back there with him can he get me a family visa thanks in advance

hello guys this month is a disaster month for me i got a parking ticket for parking in city center which obviously was a parking coz it has a number f43 but it was on a sidewalk and i had to pay 300 qr and 3 points now i just got a flash for overspeeding on corniche road the moi is still not updated but can anyone tell me how much is the fine and is there any points for over speeding thanks 
min 600 
why the heck did i get one i was parked just like everyone else right in front of the grand cafe where we always used to park this is the first time this has happened i just do n t understand why 
nadinenana long time and tig 
i got a yellow sticker attached to my driver side window of the car it happened yesterday dont know what to do it is written in arabic i have checked the hukoomi side for traffic violation there is no traffic violation or may be it is too early to check on the web site what should i do appreciate your help 
u have to wait 4 2days 
i got a parking fine for parking the street opposite the city center last friday and i ve been doing this for few months back and many still parking there but i did n t received any parking ticket stick to my car so you ll never know when the traffic police will strike and give parking fine huh who else got a parking fine out there join the party 
hi i also was in city centre and i noted that police man was trying to get the slip from that due to some problem he taken snaps and left it he did for car where they parked in platform left right please check it 
where do i pay a speeding ticket fine the www moi gov qa website says that i got my picture taken last month i ve heard that most people do n t pay fines until they come to sell the car i ve also heard that the fine gets increased by 10 for every month it is n t paid i d rather pay now thanks 
you used to be able to pay it online at the e government site but that s been under maintenance for a long time now go to the traffic department either at madinat khalifa or airport to pay you need to renew your car s road permit once a year that s when uou have to do a traffic violations check before they renew the permit fines do n t increase you just have to pay it when your road permit is up or if you re involved in a car accident they check for violations then 
parked my car on the road in front of jarir bookstore and when i returned saw the yellow parking violation sticker on my window did n t see any no parking sign but well my first traffic ticket now i m a full pledged member of doha driver s club anybody knows how much is the fine for such violation cheers sk 
600qar 
is there anyway we could get a discount with the speeding ticket if we pay it through the traffic police offices directly 
funny no way 
i got a message that i have a fine of 200 qr for talking on the phone in dafna area enno come on how do they fine people without giving them tickets maybe i was driving and placed my hand on my head but i was not talking on the phone lol really is this fair 200 qr thats too much and my collegues had the same fine in the same area now how does this work 
victory attained by violence is tantamount to a defeat for it is momentary mahatma gandhi 
been hearing that city center is to implement paid parking from july 1 onwards anyone have more details from what i saw everything seems to be in place the ticket dispensers the payment machines and all 
so employees will look for other spaces to park their car the whole day and leave nothing to customers 
any one known abt american acadamy school

american academy school you must to call and reserv from nowadays 4551278 fax 4551281 email amacademy qatar net qa good luck 
i have a boy in 9th grade and school is very important to decide wether we move or not i understand they are very expensive schools american international schools are very expensive every where i would like to know which of these two school is better with good certified qualified teachers etc etc thank you in advance 
both schools have good reputations you have to decide what would be a better fit for your son asd might seem expensive compared to qa but qa is subsidized by qatar foundation compared to american schools in the region saudi emirates etc asd is quite reasonable for your tuition at asd you get highly qualified teachers an excellent facility ample and varied resources a friendly student population where new students are usually assimilated quickly and most typical activities of an american high school but with an international twist it also offers extensive ap courses qa is an ib curriuculum and while i know less about it i have heard good things from teachers and parents both would ultimately be what your son makes of them

never leave your kids with a babysitter kindergartens are safer and teach your children various skills and knowledge read the newspapers there have been many issues with nannies abusing the children in their care kindergarten is definately the best bet

okay girls this is a doubt that has been bugging me since quite some time i ve been using this particular shampoo since a few months it promises to give health and shine to hair but there are other shampoos which give bounce strength volume etc is it okay if i mix a couple of shampoos and use i asked one of my friends and she says it s not advisable what do y all think 
my stylist actually recommends that i change shampoos every once in a while the reasoning is that your hair becomes used to the particular shampoo and looses a bit of it effectiveness i mix shampoos i generally use moisturizing but i do use a clarifying shampoo for a week or so every couple of months did your friend say why you shouldnt use different shampoos diplomacy is the art of saying nice doggie until you can find a rock will rogers

there are a couple of pure gyms i know of sas gym and gold s gym this one you may not know of it unless you are american which cater for the gym freaks the latter gym i believe is spoofed in dodgeball w ben stiller and will farrell however there are a few that are health clubs which is what you are after in your description they are al dana club diplomatic club doha club but closing soon and clubs in major hotels intercon ramada ritz sheraton etc plus al sharq ritz carlton opening soon and some other hotels i think most are pretty full prices for singles range from 3000qr to 8000qr per year appr do not know of any with climbing walls can i ask do the numerous stadiums have gyms that can be used also somewhere like aspire can you use any of the facilities there plus many housing compunds have all these facilities the quality depends on the compund offcourse some are real nice such as mirage al fardan beverly hills tbah etc some not so 
i am thinking of changing gyms when i go back this time but i wan na train early in the morning as opposed to regular hours when they are crowded anyone know of any 24 hour gyms in qatar i doubt they exist knowing qatar 
the gym at intercon is open 24 7 thats the only one that i know off be like a flower which gives off it s fragrance even to the hand that crushes it 
sigh what a disappointment even the classes are separated so you got ta look our for female only spin or whatever also the male workout area is big and spacious and nice female workout area small and enclosed and limited i m losing my gym motivation any experiences with other gyms or other workout groups etc

rambee visit aspire and ask about their evening sports activities bring your passport or qatar id because you need to register before you could avail of their multifacted sports activities you pay a minimal fee monthly because aspire is subsidized by the government some sports they have include boxing swimming various ball games yoga and others one good thing about their evening program is that each sports class has a professional instructor dedicated not merely to teach but also to ensure student health and safety i will go to aspire than enrol in any other chic gym here in qatar good luck 
ok since it appears that gold s gym only caters to desperate housewives i e women are only allowed from 7 am till 12 pm i mean wtf sorry i m at work are there any other gyms that cater to women on d ring or are we just expected to sit at home and pop out babies

i want to work in qatar for few months and then i may go outside qatar for my further studies i applied here in some companies but they will give me job only if i change my sponsor is dere any solution fo this 
my wife and myself are on work visa my wife is expecting now will there be any visa issues for the baby what visa would the baby be 
must be under father sponsor but need to met the criteria for family sponsorship 
im married i have my marriage certificate will there be any problems 
is your husband here and a resident of this country if so then you do n t have any problem 
can anyone plz tel me which visa is better for my wife she got a job here and they can provide visa but i m bit confused so tel me which visa is better under my sponsorship or her company sponsorship 
under your sponsorship always better 
i applied for visa transfer change of sponsorship more than 2 months back and the application is still under process any thoughts why it is taking so much time is it normal to take such a long time thank you for your help 
are you transferring it to a semi govt or a govt firm 
dear friends my son who is working here on my sponsorship will be in doha while i would be outside qatar on my leave my question is can i get my son s exit permit now having advance dates and proceed to my vacations i am confused that while mine being outside qatar my son may have problem getting outside qatar during my leave time 
get an exit permit application form and sign it before you are going on vacation and tell your son to apply it to the immigration before he is going on vacation 
can my sponsor cancel my visa even without my passport thank you guys 
but do n t know the process it is possible 
quick question can a lady who is under her fathers sponsorship get a liquor license she is working and meets the salary requirements and not muslim any clues anyone if yes what are the procedures same as men if no then have a good day visit again lol 
i have the same question but a wife under husband s sponcership in this case 
can anyone tell me what are the necessary requirements or papers needed to get a license for liquor 
get a letter from your employer giving you permission basically a no objection letter the letter also needs to state your salary as the amount of liquor you may buy depends on that once you have the letter bring it to the qdc bring your rp and cash there is a fee but i ca n t remember how much there is an atm there they will issue you a card and you are done 
can anyone advise me what to do i want to transfer to my husband s sponsorship problem is he is just earning qr6k a month my present company will provide me the noc i already received some job offers but they are looking for someone under husband sponsorship would appreciate your immediate response 
minimum of qr7k to be able for you to be under husband sponsor the sad truth is most company s preferred husband sponsor look for another company lucky for you that you have noc goodluck marie your only limitation is your soul

i have several experiences of opening packaging of items bought from carrefour only to discover that someone else had already owned the item before me on each occasion i took the items back to carrefour and wasted my breath telling them that they should not simply repackage returned items and put them back out for sale

hi everyone my husband has just got a job with qatar airways and i m hoping to get my three children into a british school in doha in september 2012 i need a place in year 3 year 2 and reception can anybody advise on how likely that is i m not sure if i should stay in the uk until i can get the children into a school or could that be a really long wait any information would be greatly received many thanks xx 
wait and only apply to doha english speaking school if they get accepted then leave the uk this school is only british school which follow the actual british curriculum and is monitored by the british educational council all the rest of the british school claim they follow the british curriculum who is there to monitor the school if you pay for a private company to accredit the school they will come out and give you accreditation you will find out that your child will be a year behind because majority of the schools do n t have the textbooks for each subject in the class nor do they have a curriculum without textbooks or manuals sadly the teachers have to deal with the parents as to why their child is behind because the principal will pond you over to the teacher for any complaints 
i tried searching on this topic but i falied to find an answer what is the basic salary for a filipino maid if i hire through an agency 
there is minimum salary by contract 700 qr but you must give her a nice room to live in and bathroom kitchen she can use food and any medical help if she needs hala card and mobile if she does n t have and money monthly or how you want for mobile credit she must keep in touch with her family and of course to provide with such things like soap shampoo etc but 700 qr is really nothing for that hard job what they are doing so increase it 
it seems that most posts these days are copy paste jobs of upsetting sad negative news from newspapers is this all we can come up with where are happy and cheerful news and posts i miss those days 
all but lovely memories of ql nowadays i take a peep just to see what s posting and log out i bid everyone good night the sandman has come 
so how much it should cost to paint a 3bhk house if all the washable paints are used in 2 bedrooms the coloring man is going to use the computer mix shade what s this so if you are having any kind of painting experience please share with me with an estimate of course 
i always wanted to paint my house in india but was never allowed by my parents i have experience in painting my room though i used oil paint seriously painting a 3 bed room house would cost you close to 2000 qr including the labour charges the computer mix color is nothing but mixing of different shades and applying it on virtual walls for your approval its a good thing to do coz you can make up your mind life is beautiful indeed 
do you think qatar will be like dubai after how many years 
my family and i are moving to doha in august we want to bring our 2 jeeps with us i would like to drive both from dubai to doha can anyone tell me the procedure and paperwork needed also can i drive my wife s car or can a friend drive it for her and finally can i bring some of our personal effects with us in the car if anyone can help with these questions that would be great 
doha to dubai first you can ship one of the cars i am told it will cost about 2k qar aed you will need to get a transit visa for the drive through saudi and for this you will need a valid gcc residence visa aside from this i would have thought that you just register the car with the ministry of transportation once you are here but not sure if that involves anything different than what you would need for a car bought here if your car is too old you wo n t be able to register it in doha i think 2006 models are the oldest allowed this year no idea about the stuff but good question i wanted to do the same it would not have occurred to me that this might be a problem 
i ve been offered a job in qatar the money seems great is the standard of living cost of living the smae compared to dubai what about night life can 1 go out and have fun like in dubai is their open beaches and park to chill and relax what about living arrangements can i bring my fiance whom i ll wed in december 2008 can we stay together please somebody help me decide brendan 
doha is not dubai but it has its own charm cost of living standard is the same nightlife is not so like dubai but we love it beaches are far better then dubai parks are ok regarding your fiance you will have to get atleast paper marriage in the embassy if not then you can not img nid 50852 title hmm desc link none align left width height 0 i would rather have one rose and a kind word from a friend while i m here than a whole truck load when i m gone 
hi i want to travel to dubai to meet a friend in idd but travel by plane is expensive can anyone let me know if there is a bus service from doha to dubai how to get a visa and what to do are there any tour operators who would provide a complete 4 5 days tour of dubai that includes travel by bus visa cheap hotel etc 
ask your friend to come here dear 
have any expats on this forum either bought property in qatar or considered buying and then rejected i e zig zag towers the pearl etc i m trying to evaluate whether or not this would be a good investment what do you think are the potential risks and upsides if you have bought what was your experience of the process and in hindsight was it a good decision regards 
personally i think the real estate industry may start a down slide soon it seems like rents have skyrocketed within the last year or two it is likely that the asian games had soemthing to do with this and i just can not imagine the prices of real estate maintaining this insane rate for much longer something has to give on the flip side of the coin qatar has been and still is expanding at a fast rate there could continue to be a growth spurt and that would mean that more housing would be needed for workers i m absolutly no help am i lol sorry 
dubai from riches to rags just say the word dubai and the images appear impossible glass structures glistening in the year round sun perfect man made beaches yachts private helicopters malls and spreads of food that would satisfy roman emperors all the things huge amounts of new money can buy but http news bbc co uk panorama hi front newsid 7981320 stm nothing new eh 
i agree with the article dubai is all that and more only been in qatar 3 months but can see it is the same here why treat these poor hard working people like that you re kidding yourself 
what do you think qatar needs more entertainment concerts theatres sporting events casinos more products electronics foods automobiles more infrastructure better roads parks landmarks i am looking for some great insight tell me what you think and it might just happen 
except casino it will not happen here p 
i am currently working here in qatar our employer informed us that they will transfer to contractor with less salary but we have option not to accept but the problem is i have personal loan in one of the bank here in doha what if i will not accept the offer what will happen to me i mean did the bank will force to pay or not 
haha so you want to get away without paying the loan 
i have got a visit visa from qatar but now i heard from a friend of mine that if i have a ban in uae then i can not enter qatar i was working in uae and was fired during the crisis period so i had to flee the country without clearing my credit cards and bank loan debts so naturally the banks will go to court now if i wish to travel to qatar will it be possible waiting for your valuable comments 
you can coznif u blacklist or ban you wo n t get the visa of this country 
i would like to ask if anyone knows how much is the travel time from abu dhabi to dubai by car i heard one hour then i was told it s 4 5 hours so i would like to know from those who have been there and is there too much traffic in abu dhabi as well 
are you going to walk from abu to dubai but its not 1hours on road thats for sure 
ok i m not sure how much truth there is in this as i heard it on qbs last night and ca n t seem to find any articles about it but apprantely dubai is passing a law requiring anyone applying for residency to pass a cultural awareness test what says you good idea or bad 
qbs

villagio is already open and it is a carbon copy of city centre do n t expect anything exciting 
first and foremost my deepest sympathy and condolences to the the family who got affected by this recent tragedy is it still possible for villaggio to open after this incident 
investigation to the cause of the fire is still going on and correcting repairing the sprinkler will take ages fire alarms needs to be re checked and repaired upgraded a well fire damage assessments on all establishments will take time owners will have to pay penalties fines and clear the legal criminal civil charges before they could operate as a mall let s say in 1 or 2 months or less depending on how fast or slow things gon na be 
for all of you shoppers out there on july 31 a gap store opened in villagio it is at the end of the canal near the ice skating rink the best part is the prices are comparable to the original stores in the states i just wanted to let everyone know also a banana republic is opening soon in villagio maybe an old navy is next 
i feel sad a lot of shops are opened qatari people are starting to abandon their traditional clothes 
does anyone hae any updates or ideas when the cinema in villagio will open or any new cinema at that there s signs saying opening soon around villagio but that ambiguous at best i m really itching to watch a good movie 
villaggio cinema there are other cinemas in doha like city centre mall etc why are you so desperate to watch movie in villagio 
i read that they will open a branch at villagio can anyone inform me more about this cant wait if true i literally live 2 min away from villagio 
why not contacting them and confirming that info best of luck

hi all me and some friends from london are looking to come over to doha for a couple of weeks whats the party scene like on friday and saturday nights i hear that in qatar nobody goes out on saturday is that true where would you go for rnb and hiphop and ive heard alot about a club called qube is it any good any feedback would be welcome thanks 
if you enjoy filipino cover bands and lots of asian variety in the crowd then the qube is great however if you enjoy more of the western flair you are down to garvey s rugby club and rydges of these your best bet for fri and sat night my opinion so no flames from anyone is going to be rydges the bar is under new aussie management with the goal of much better music and faster service this past weekend was quite busy and the music was good enough to dance to so there you hav it one recommendation

you already have a active thread from mar 27th on the same subject 
we are relocating from south africa in july and i have literally applied to all the british and american schools for my 4 years son and been refused by each of them we have however been lucky to get a spot at acs doha i know its a new school but has anyone heard anything about it and is there confirmation of whether they follow american or british curriculum 
as you say it s a new school so it s difficult to confirm anything i believe the buildings are not yet 100 complete but it s nothing for you to worry about since the school year will only start in september good luck with the move and with the heat when you get here 
dilemma we are coming to doha end of december and still have not secured schools for both my children 5 yrs and 7 yrs old we managed to secure 1 seat at dess and they informed us that the younger is on a sibling waiting list with this term coming to an end i am eager to secure a second place and currently looking elsewhere do you have any ideas for good british schools in doha so i can have both children together 
try sherborne qatar

hello can someone please let me know the best schools on doha i am a little worried my son is 2 and want him to start preschool when he is 3 thus i am starting to look i really had interest in sending him to qatar academy but just found out that admissions is closed for non qataris i am a little upset but can someone please tell me what my options are thanks tanu 
the cambridge school doha 
dear everyone in this forum i am an india and ny kids are currently studying in an indian school in doha i want some information on dess doha english speaking school i want to put both my child aged 7 and 8 in dess i heard the school is very good can you please suggest how should i prepare them for this is there any interview process any reference is accepted please help 
sorry dess is a community school sponsored by the british embassy and give priority to british passport holders if you do n t hold a british passport then do n t waste you time as they will not accept your application there are a lot of british passport holders on the waiting list you can try some other internationals school that teach the english curriculum like the british school dmbs doha collge parkhouse and sherbourne etc 
hello all hope all is well i am trying to enroll my 2 children in gulf english school in algarraffa area anyone knows anything about the school there is no annual school reports system in doha to read and compare english schools i am single mum originally from the middle east but my children lived and educated in the uk and have very good english background your help will be highly apprecited thanking you susan 
i wish someone can give a tiny info about the school 
good evening ladies and gentlemen i might move to doha by the end of the year at the moment i am looking at both posibilities from various posts i learned that it will be very difficult to get my daughter into dess or the doha colege she is 14 nearly 15 and is currently in 3rd year in ireland what would be the approximate cost for both schools and does someone know how long the waiting lists are cheers brain 
best to talk to the schools direct via their web sites keep your kids with you as long as you can there is nothing wrong with the schools in doha dess and doha college are not the only schools there are many more 
hiya does anyone have any kids in parkhouse school that could give me a real good insight with regards to the teaching standards etc please would the kids fit back into the uk system if they were to go back to uk sometime lol any other comments appreciated thanks 
shityouno your name says what you are shityuono 
looking to change my children s school have either doha britsh or doha college in mind can anyone please give me their opinions on both schools i have a little time to play with so no problem re wait list etc many thanks in advance 
doha college hands down it s more established non profit better resourced and has the sponsorship of the british embassy for the secondary school if your children are in primary school doha college is a good option but by general consensus dess is the best even more established is solely for primary and has the sponsorship of the british embassy doha british is acceptable but ultimately like so many other schools it is less well established and is a business which means that profitability for the owners is important unlike dc and dess who have all the tuition and fees going back into the school

procedure to give my car on rent i have a toyota corrolla and i want to give it somebody on rent monthly basis what is the procedure rules and process for that plz give me advice thank u 
hi everybody could you advice me where can i rent car without giving my passport coz i travel alot and i dont ve credit card either i want 2 rent a car automatic and full insurance im new driver gon na rent 1 st time i dont know how can i choose thanks in advance 
hi i dont think its possible to rent without a passport credit card atleast they would ask you for a signed cheque even if their car is full insured in case of accident they would always demand a fixed sum so beware and think twice before you rent best of luck dont take it as final wait for other qler s to respond too 
i m sorry i know this has been asked before a thousand times the problem is most of the threads are 4 years old what is the absolutely cheapest car available for rent through a reputable company i m not interested in renting from anyone s friend thanks 
try national car rental al saad satreet just beside nissan showroom i just rented a small nissan with 75 qr per day monthly rate will be cheaper for sure 
i went for rent a car but the guy there ask to keep my passport would any one share their experience 
can you provide the name of the company thanks 
where i can put the information for my car thanks for your reading 
why would you like to put your car information for sale rent or for exhibition there is no better place then qatarliving com classifieds if you want to sell it outside qatar then look for other alternatives 
my lease in my current place ends in december but frankly i m sick of paying for my overpriced rent while all around me prices are dropping i wonder if everyone knows what the legal repercutions are of skipping out on my lease

doha to dubai first you can ship one of the cars i am told it will cost about 2k qar aed you will need to get a transit visa for the drive through saudi and for this you will need a valid gcc residence visa aside from this i would have thought that you just register the car with the ministry of transportation once you are here but not sure if that involves anything different than what you would need for a car bought here if your car is too old you wo n t be able to register it in doha i think 2006 models are the oldest allowed this year no idea about the stuff but good question i wanted to do the same it would not have occurred to me that this might be a problem

hi every one i want to know about acca worth in qatar like acca qualified person with one year experience in auditing can get job easily in qatar and how much minimume pay can earn acording to market trend thanks 
i m doing acca just like you but to be realistic the market in qatar don t give fair pay according to certificates it depends if you from europe or us or arab or asia another thing it depends if you have good relation with the people who have power on that company at last it will be around 15 000 to 50 000 depends on the above 
it can happen to all of us employees it can happen today tomorrow or in the near future im just wondering how you would face this example what shall i say doing interviews for next job as i was fired from the previous one i am moving on with a positive attitude but i m afraid the above question will not get me past the interviewer s first pass filter 
there is nothing wrong with being fired as long as it is not due to negligance on your part you could be fired due to financial crisis and cutting down on costs you could be fired due to qatarization you could be fired for many reasons that would not put a negative image on you and ruin ur chances iwth a new oppurtunity wysiwyg 
while police department allows for short course while having an experience while some of driving schools try to make things difficult through pre test just for their profit or they have not such qualified instructor who can train with propose time because all time instructor also force student to go for full course

i took a 2 week leave which coincided with the 3 days eid el fitr holiday in the middle the company deducted my salary for these 3 days saying that the holiday fell within my leave so i was not not entitled to it as paid holiday is it true that the qatar labour law for this section has been interpreted as such 
yes its correct it is a public holiday so will not be entitled to receive any salary for these 3 days

congratulations to naia 
is it difficult to get a taxi from the delhi airport to agra how about getting around in agra is it hard how about getting back from there to delhi what i m trying to ascertain is whether it s better to get a travel agency to organize it for me or if it s better that i book the hotels myself and just catch a taxi thanks 
will you staying in delhi or agra if you are staying in delhi you can ask the hotel to arrange day trip for you to visit agra hotel people can assist you in getting taxis don t hire a taxi by yourself there are lots of crimes happening with foreigners to be on safer side always go for prepaid taxi arranged by your hotel there are shuttle bus which takes tourist to agra and back 
what are the taxis like in doha and elsewhere in qatar first do they use meters argos to charge you for the distance traveled or is every ride a bartering session are there any established brands that are known for safety and fairness alternatively should some taxi brands be avoided some people have posted here that taxis are hard to find in doha how do the telephone ordered radio dispatched taxis work on time and okay thanks 
only one company running taxis in doha karwa and they use meter 
any korean s on qatar living or have you visited korea before if so can you drop me a pm i would be interested in visiting your lovely country and trying to work out the best itinerary thanks

i keep hearing that there is a harley davidson store somewhere in doha but no hotel concierge or any cab driver seems to know where it is does anybody know of the location 
yes there is one the last i remember it was right next to the airport i hope they didnt close it down after creating the new traffic signal basically tell the cab driver or limo driver to take you to the airport traffic lights there are only one you cant go wrong if when you reach the traffic lights the airport is infront of you then you have come from the ramada hilal direction and the harley store will be directly to your left while you are stopped at the signal you will see the sign and the bikes inside if however the driver takes the corneesh road by the sea towards the airport then when you reach the airport traffic light the airport will be to your left so you tell the driver to turn right on the traffic light like he is going towards the mall and you will see the harley store on your right as soon as you turn right on the traffc light it is right next to two cargo shipping companies one of them called ali bin ali so its in between the airport traffic lights and the mall r 
doha airport is a disaster area and it will only get worse the queues willnot improve because the authorities do n t care ca n t wait for the disastrous world cup egate applications are now ridiculously complicated just to create more jobs for people with little appetite to work my thoughts 
despite the even longer and despised bus ride to and from the aircraft arrivals are much better imho than before but i have an egate pass there also always seems to be someone directing traffic at the regular immigration queue once you have your luggage you no longer have to struggle to put it on the xray belt and retrieve it by yourself after a long flight a big improvement in my book 
anyone has information on doha airport parking longterm how much it will cost for long term parking say 3 days 7 days and one month 
just park the car as many days as you need the rate lol i have no idea to know exactly follow the above idea lol

lol i really dont know why but i also know plenty of arabs that are kind and respectful people poverty is not for the sake of hardship no it is there because nothing exists but god poverty unlocks the door what a blessed key jalaluddin al rumi 
hello could anyone help to clarify what sponsorship law is about i only have a vague idea that it restricts you from changing job once you are working for a company in qatar is it correct and complete btw for those who have finished your contract in qatar do you return to your homeland or find another nice land in middle east asia etc for further adventure thanks f co good hotmail com 
it basicly states that you are a slave to your sponsor or his deputy as in my case it sucks man and if you are not coming to a real good job in a respectable place mostly this translates into a place run by non arabs specially egyptians do n t waste your life by coming here hong kong is much better you ca n t change your job buy a car go out of the country open a bank account etc without his consent

you ll probably get away with 21kg but less likely with 22kg and they quite often weigh the hand luggage note also that the dimensions for hand luggage on qa is smaller than on some other airlines ba for example

q73 
i do n t understand the question surely you must have decided before you apply why you want to go to a particular country if it is just to have a western passport who cares canada is cold for much of the year austalia is warmer but has some hotspots sometimes this is not a very specific question to be honest if you are going to any other country other than to reside there permanently you are not emigrating for legitimate reasons you are emigrating to get the passport what is the matter with your birth country s passport 
is there any good migration consultant for australia or canada in qatar please help me out guys 
ok wts ur profession the adman 4 ur advertising needs call me 
we re interested in having our baby in canada i d like to see if anyone out there has done it too 
there is no such thing as birth tourism in canada in fact you will probably either be denied a visa or turned away at immigration if there is any suspicion that you are there solely to give birth this is an immigration scam because canada confers nationality on children born in canada but reserves the right to deport the parents be very careful there have been cases where the baby gets to stay but the parents have to leave

hi everyone i am planning to move to qatar next month can anybody tell me what is the system for a newcomer on driving license is it that one has to pass a rigorous driving test and then he is ussied a drving license for a fee even though he possesses a driving license of his home country rgds asd 
i think it depends on where your original drivers license is from i think people from the states uk south africa canada and probably others can just convert there old licenses to a local qatar driving license you just need to do an eye test 
went to madinat kalifa to convert my american driving license the rules were changed in may 2009 i have no idea why americans will have to take the tests before a license is issued do brits face a similiar dilemma 
i guess its a good move driving in qatar needs much more expertise than driving in us or uk  listen to many speak to a few

my colleague has a kindle and it works perfectly fine if you talking about available in gcc then that is a marketing issue and there are a lot of items which take quite some time to reach the gcc market eg we just got the iphone was thinking of buying an ebook reader myself either the kindle or sony but going to hold on a bit as the technology is too new and there are lot of issues till then my laptop will have to do

weekend as i have always known it before coming to the middle east was classified as a saturday sunday here for some its friday and saturday are you one of the fortunate ones with 2 days weekend or unfortunate what are you planning for your weekend have a grrrr 8 one what ever you do 
i think it ll be in my bed the flu is on the way atchummmm 
i m moving to qutar on friday in 2days what can i wear what ca n t i wear can i wear knee length dresses and skirts can they be just above the knee 
my wife and i are moving to qatar in october from the usa texas she is a bit concerned on what is proper dress for women we have been told that anything is fine as long as her sholders are covered and her knees she is very upset about having to cover up when its 115 degrees outside what is acceptable 
as a woman here in qatar i encountered the same problem when i moved here last year i was told long sleeves and long skirts that is not entirely true esp in the summer when the heat is unbearable your wife can wear capris knees do need to be covered and short sleeved tops as long as the neckline is n t too low the benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants the general rule is that it should n t be too tight or two revealing also keep in mind that they run the a c on high everywhere so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants malls etc you are arriving in october so the weather will be fine like spring weather in the states very pleasant actually last winter it actually got quite cold here so bring jackets and even a light weight winter coat or heavier if you intend to travel during winter one other option a number of western women do wear abayas aro 
we have been invited to a qatari wedding this thursday and apart from not knowing anyone as my husband will be on the men s party and i will be at the women s party to state the obvious i have no idea what to expect and what the customs are what should i wear do we bring a gift what happens during a wedding i am very honored to have been invited but terrified of making a fool of my self 
qatari wedding gents section there sure will be two diff section one each for ladies and gents the practice is to greet the groom and his family elders first then be seated in the hall red tea arabic coffee will be served will be called for the buffet dinner have dinner and say good bye and thanks to the groom n the family member and leave ladies not sure about the custom dg amensia might help ps be sure not to use mobile camera phones 
do women wear open toe or closed toe shoes in qatar what is an acceptable height of heel what women s shoes are accepted in qatari culture are expat women held to the same standard regarding shoes as qatari women thanks in advance

my family and i are moving to qatar next year we lived in saudi 10 years ago a co worker said expat men and women can wear shorts in public in qatar i find that extremely difficult to believe what s the truth thanks kevin in houston 
yes you can wear shorts just not really short indecent shorts they should be to the knee and shoulders need to be covered ie no singlet tops for either men or women however many ex pats do flout this

i finished my contract last year in qatar i received the letter of no objection from my employer can i come back to qatar after 3 months and work for the same company your answers appreciated 
hello could anyone help to clarify what sponsorship law is about i only have a vague idea that it restricts you from changing job once you are working for a company in qatar is it correct and complete btw for those who have finished your contract in qatar do you return to your homeland or find another nice land in middle east asia etc for further adventure thanks f co good hotmail com 
it basicly states that you are a slave to your sponsor or his deputy as in my case it sucks man and if you are not coming to a real good job in a respectable place mostly this translates into a place run by non arabs specially egyptians do n t waste your life by coming here hong kong is much better you ca n t change your job buy a car go out of the country open a bank account etc without his consent 
i m planning to resign in my company by next year just finishing my contract for almost 2 years can i come back in less than a year or not i ve heard that if working here in qatar for more than 2 years you can come back in least than a year without having an noc how true is that hoping for positve response to all of you guys thanks 
without noc you will get a 2 year ban 
hi guys i got a job offer from qatar and the probation periods are for three months if for any reason i dont like the company or the job can i leave my job i need some advise from the experts out here thanks 
no if you do n t like your job you have to stay here until they release you no such thing as resigning and they will chain you to your desk if they even suspect you want to resign 
i am working in qatar on last 6 years my present salary 5000 qr i would like to resign from my job and settle back to my nativ country can u please advise me what kind of benefits i can expect according to qatar labor law is it company can give the gratuity together with monthly salary is it allow by the law here if i go legal action against company any use please advise 
qatar labor law is made to protect the interest of expats working in qatar min you can get 21 days vacation per year 21 days gratuity per year of year worked min should be one year of service 
end of service benefits gratuity calculation dear ql ers i wish to know how is gratuity calculated in qatar government authority offices the knowledge i have is that it should be number of years worked x last basic salary date of joined 2001 
it is computed at the last basic salary you re receiving 1 month basic salary per year of service up to a maximum of 10 years hope this helps

haha so you want to get away without paying the loan 
hi guys i need to ask from you what to do if you need your noc for you to move to a higher paying and better job if the company you are working doesnt want to release it im very much wanting to get a good paying job im kinda tight up with the contract that i have in my present job i would appreciate it very much for any advise thanks

guyz and girls i have a bf we recently met everything was goin gr8 and crystal but lately its not i mean he is gettin further and not showin his past usual care although no major problems appearing he just says its work issues wat u think is he a player does he have a real execuse or its just a lack of chemistry in between us 
hi icandomore personally if the guy was serious wouldnt he still be 100 in the relationship suggest that you check things with him again work is always work but it can only be an excuse to a certain point perhaps he isnt a player but just isnt man enough to tell you he wants out of the relationship too many things to consider evaluate and decide life is too short to waste on dwelling on things that arent worth it

for the most part cellulite treatments are a very temporary thing most also do n t work and ashok if you have n t mentioned which kind of cellulite treatment is bad for you since most of them are topical and a massage there are some invasive ones but those have questionable results also dragon tell your friend to save her money take used coffee grounds massage them into her area that has cellulite with a circular motion the caffeine in the grounds constrict the skin and vessels making it look tighter plus it has a great exfoliating effect grant me the senility to forget the people i never liked the good fortune to run into the ones i do and the eyesight to tell the difference

compass is a relatively new venture my daughter is a year 6 student at compass we are delighted with her progress in my opinion it is well worth contacting compass to enquire about spaces particularly as doha college and park school are over subscribed if your kids are successful at gaining a place at compass you could always put their names on the waiting list for those other schools in the mean time they will be getting a first class education at compass you may however be so pleased with compass that you decide to keep them there

you used to be able to pay it online at the e government site but that s been under maintenance for a long time now go to the traffic department either at madinat khalifa or airport to pay you need to renew your car s road permit once a year that s when uou have to do a traffic violations check before they renew the permit fines do n t increase you just have to pay it when your road permit is up or if you re involved in a car accident they check for violations then 
i dont know thts the reason i ask if somebody can tell me is every girl or female cover her hair head like all muslim wimen do in qatar i really need to know tht 
my wife and i are moving to qatar in october from the usa texas she is a bit concerned on what is proper dress for women we have been told that anything is fine as long as her sholders are covered and her knees she is very upset about having to cover up when its 115 degrees outside what is acceptable 
as a woman here in qatar i encountered the same problem when i moved here last year i was told long sleeves and long skirts that is not entirely true esp in the summer when the heat is unbearable your wife can wear capris knees do need to be covered and short sleeved tops as long as the neckline is n t too low the benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants the general rule is that it should n t be too tight or two revealing also keep in mind that they run the a c on high everywhere so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants malls etc you are arriving in october so the weather will be fine like spring weather in the states very pleasant actually last winter it actually got quite cold here so bring jackets and even a light weight winter coat or heavier if you intend to travel during winter one other option a number of western women do wear abayas aro 
i m getting bald is there any solution my friend told me its due to the shampoo iam using some say its the water inhiritance etc what really do a bald man look awkward please help me to prevent this

our company is recently downsizing and unfortunately i m one of those lucky ones that got terminated though our company promised us that they will provide us a release papers the big question is what will happen to my liabilities in my bank i have an outstanding loan and credit card thanks in advance guys and hope you can help me 
if the termination information is given to bank by your company hr department the bank will blocked your account they will immediately give access once you give them the appointment letter from new company provided that new company is listed in the same bank though your current company is not directly liable for your loan if possible request them not to inform bank for the time being and you can continue repay monthly installment to bank in cash or with available balance another option is to withdraw money for your few months expense till you get new job

hi everyone my husband has just got a job with qatar airways and i m hoping to get my three children into a british school in doha in september 2012 i need a place in year 3 year 2 and reception can anybody advise on how likely that is i m not sure if i should stay in the uk until i can get the children into a school or could that be a really long wait any information would be greatly received many thanks xx 
wait and only apply to doha english speaking school if they get accepted then leave the uk this school is only british school which follow the actual british curriculum and is monitored by the british educational council all the rest of the british school claim they follow the british curriculum who is there to monitor the school if you pay for a private company to accredit the school they will come out and give you accreditation you will find out that your child will be a year behind because majority of the schools do n t have the textbooks for each subject in the class nor do they have a curriculum without textbooks or manuals sadly the teachers have to deal with the parents as to why their child is behind because the principal will pond you over to the teacher for any complaints

i was in a similar condition in 1990 i married my girlfriend and the problems disappeared it s that easy

from what i understand i can not live with my boyfriend there we both have jobs lined up but we want to wait to marry in another year so our entire family can be with us right now that can not happen i do not know what to do i have read about how difficult it is to find accommodations for a single girl and that i can not live with my boyfriend now i do not know if i should make the move with him 
finding accommodation for a single girl is not so difficult you can definitely find one if both of you have job offers lined up i would say why not come here together but live separately till married co habiting of unmarried couple is a big no no here and may land you and your boyfriend in big trouble with authorities if reported i e jail followed by deportation of both of you 
what would happen and what would the authorities do about it and in your own opinion what do you think of this issue ps no i am not doing it im just happening to ask it just occured to me 
i ve heard that even if a married couple were caught kissing in public they would be penalized kissing in public in general is not recommended even if authorities did n t catch u u would stared at and given bad looks and i think we should respect the culture of the country we re in so i would say u should n t make a huge romantic scene in the mall if u can save it till home i think to avoid all the hassle just keep ur relationship discreet in public

this is a question to the likes of pm and others who converted to islam basically what is involved how does a person start the process just intrested 
my start was that i went to the department of islamic affairs and got a bunch of books including the quran i started reading at 11am and did not stop until 11pm i immediately knew that this was the religion for me eventhough i was highly sceptical when i started reading i have read so much since learned by talking to other moslims taken some courses but my thing is reading so i did that the most i suggest you talk to some other new moslims it will be easier as the questions you have are the same questions they had when i started there were not many people i could approach nor where there any centres as such and i talked with moslims by birth and they had a hard time understanding my questions ofcourse if i can help let me know aisha taweela 
i would like to know are there classes after school where kids can go and learn the quran or is it easy to find a teacher to come to your place

none sorry 
are there any islamic studies after school centers available for english speaking children i know such services are provided in arabic but my children do n t speak arabic will appriciate anyhelp 
i have the same question as you i d love to know if there was some place after school the kids can learn arabic anyone know 
i have a serious question to those nonmuslims who work in qatar now after living in an islamic country do you find the islam something different from that you were hearing about before if yes is this difference positive or negative in your openion what are the reasons of the difference between the real islam and your previous background do you think now you have a complete image about what is islam or you need more time 
i had a better image of islam when i was back in india 
i have been following up the world championship in artistic gymnastics and then there was a picture of a qatari gymnast aljazy al habshi http www minkusimages de img mi077 jpg just would like to understand how does it comply with islamic rules of woman covering body and hair or is this girl violating the religious rules would like to get an answer from our fellow qataris please 
it s really up to the individual imho she could have extended the leotard down to the knee and covered her head with the same outfit material to be a little more covered conservative muslims would probably say that she should be fully covered in loose clothing with head covering she obviously felt comfortable competing like that  love is the answer 
hi qler please i would like to know some major basics which divide shia and sunni muslims most important i would like to know which one of them is the real islam thanks for your peaceful comments 
please no copy and past answers prefer personal knowlege or understanding if i wanted a copy and past no need of postion on ql cus i could googl it myself cheers action speaks louder than words

a continuation from the staring thread do certain men treat women in a disrespectful way as perceived by women because if and when they see a woman without man or a western woman even with her husband they stare and are rude is this because of culture and how they are taught to look at such women or is is because the gender ratio is skewered here 
i am western and have never had anyone say anything rude to me but they do stare i think you are reading far too much into this as many have said a lot of these guys have been years without seeing a decent woman as long as they are not saying anything sorry you had that happen no one has ever died from being stared at i feel sorry for these guys more than anything pity they have no manners and to be honest a lot of them don t even realize they are doing anything wrong 
hi we are thinking about leaving our uk home to live in doha we have a little boy who will be two in january and we are wondering if it is a good place for toddlers are there any groups and play areas etc also what kind of accomodation should we consider what are the benefits of living in an apartment block to living in a villa or compound any information would be greatly appreciated many thanks 
is there a place where they make special cakes for children with special designs and shapes like characters and so 
all good bakeries like opera bateel and swiss patisserie make such cakes 
good evening to everybody we are moving to doha in april and i am staying at home with our daughter of 17 months i was wondering if you can tell me how is life with a toddler in such a hot country here she likes outdoors so much i can not imagine how it is done in such a heat what do you mums do all day to keep them occupied is it better to leave to europe in the summer thanks so much 
hi i have 3 children and they love the outdoors but during the summer months i send them out only after sunset because it s really hot and we have a lot of sand storms or dust storms so then it s either malls or playing indoors at friends homes there are a few mother and toddler groups that do fun activities so you could join them july and august are school holidays here so many go on vacations ramadan is also around this time so no eating or drinking outside and shops open late too best of luck with your move 
hi everyone my husband has just got a job with qatar airways and i m hoping to get my three children into a british school in doha in september 2012 i need a place in year 3 year 2 and reception can anybody advise on how likely that is i m not sure if i should stay in the uk until i can get the children into a school or could that be a really long wait any information would be greatly received many thanks xx 
wait and only apply to doha english speaking school if they get accepted then leave the uk this school is only british school which follow the actual british curriculum and is monitored by the british educational council all the rest of the british school claim they follow the british curriculum who is there to monitor the school if you pay for a private company to accredit the school they will come out and give you accreditation you will find out that your child will be a year behind because majority of the schools do n t have the textbooks for each subject in the class nor do they have a curriculum without textbooks or manuals sadly the teachers have to deal with the parents as to why their child is behind because the principal will pond you over to the teacher for any complaints 
i am planning a birthday party for 8 10 girls could you suggest me a good place for that prices thank you in advance alma

i have some girlfriends who have kids in park house about same age with your son she is not in this website but you can e mail me in novita77 hotmail com then i will pass her e mail to you and you can ask her in general people i know with kids in park house are happy with it 
ive heard that this school has over 3000 on a waiting list that cant be true schooling is a real problem for us we want places for january do we have a chance with any british schools our kids are very sporty and we are from the uk what about compass any advice gratefully accepted 
compass is a relatively new venture my daughter is a year 6 student at compass we are delighted with her progress in my opinion it is well worth contacting compass to enquire about spaces particularly as doha college and park school are over subscribed if your kids are successful at gaining a place at compass you could always put their names on the waiting list for those other schools in the mean time they will be getting a first class education at compass you may however be so pleased with compass that you decide to keep them there 
i heard healthcare is free for all in qatar is that correct 
i just heard that medical treatment for residents is free and can not believe that i heard that medical treatment for native qataris is free which seems plausible but does that also apply for anyone who has residence status 
yes medical treatment for residents is free you avail this with hamad hospital or their primary care facilities 
i will be living in qatar for a couple of years and i am concerned if we got sick we might not be able to afford the treatment without some sort of health insurance 
you can have a public health insurance in doha for 200qr if you are looking for higher health coverage you will be talking about 1500 3000qr a year private hospitals anyways health services are available for quite affordable prices in doha i have been living here for 3 years now thank god i have not needed any serious medication but as i hear from the guys it is not that expensive considering that doha is tax free country if you are looking for teeth insurance in can range from 150 250 riyals per tooth for normal teeth rust fixing but if it is a surgery then it is 500 riyals and above per tooth dont worry about it it is steaming hot here and you will like it p

hey guys i m a nurse here in the phils i just signed a contract for hamad as a staff nurse the offer is 5600 qatar riyals per month plus 1000 qatar riyal for transportation allowance is that a great deal how about the free accommodation does it look good i m anxious about my new job help pls 
regarding the starting salary if it is your 1st stint to work as nurse overseas that looks to be fair with regard to the transportation allowance of qr1 000 month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital are located in the same city i mean if you will be assigned in al khor or somewhere far and your accomodation is in doha then that might need to be adjusted hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff gets housing allowance i am not a nurse but i know some nurse working with hamad hamad is a government hospital and in general they give higher salary than the private clinics hospitals can you provide me hamad s agency and contact address in the philippines as it could also be an option for my nurse daughter in the future she just passed the nursing board exam and barely starting her 1st job this month

my wife and i are moving to qatar in october from the usa texas she is a bit concerned on what is proper dress for women we have been told that anything is fine as long as her sholders are covered and her knees she is very upset about having to cover up when its 115 degrees outside what is acceptable 
as a woman here in qatar i encountered the same problem when i moved here last year i was told long sleeves and long skirts that is not entirely true esp in the summer when the heat is unbearable your wife can wear capris knees do need to be covered and short sleeved tops as long as the neckline is n t too low the benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants the general rule is that it should n t be too tight or two revealing also keep in mind that they run the a c on high everywhere so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants malls etc you are arriving in october so the weather will be fine like spring weather in the states very pleasant actually last winter it actually got quite cold here so bring jackets and even a light weight winter coat or heavier if you intend to travel during winter one other option a number of western women do wear abayas aro

i m sorry i know this has been asked before a thousand times the problem is most of the threads are 4 years old what is the absolutely cheapest car available for rent through a reputable company i m not interested in renting from anyone s friend thanks 
try national car rental al saad satreet just beside nissan showroom i just rented a small nissan with 75 qr per day monthly rate will be cheaper for sure 
we used to rent at this company and it seems they dont want to return our deposit they keep on making excuses everytime we call or visit their office any suggestions 
2 days back i had same issue i rent a car from one place in al sadd and he had 350qr to return to me when i returned the car but he ddint want to return the money that i understood from he talks the end he found a excuse not to pay that there is a small scratch on the car and i have to pay 500qr for that but for you i will do it for 350qr lol dont ever rent a car in qatar and if you want to rent go for some reputed rental companies these street rentacar companies are rip off 
soon to move to doha and will need transport when i get there do any of you have reliable recommendations for vehicle hire companies i shall be looking for a reasonable size vehicle suv mpv regards al

hi everybody could you advice me where can i rent car without giving my passport coz i travel alot and i dont ve credit card either i want 2 rent a car automatic and full insurance im new driver gon na rent 1 st time i dont know how can i choose thanks in advance

what is the procedure for lost baggage in air arabia the air arabia representatives ragency travels they said there will be a compensation i e 20 per killo who knows th etrue situation as far as i concern our baggage worth more than 200 and it is very unfare to just pay for the weight of the bag 
i know it is unfair but as far as i know that is n t air arabias rules they are the international rules under the geneva convention or something all airlines abide by these international rules if you want to claim more money you have to do it through your travel insurance 
not living in doha at the moment but i wondered if travelling on vacation is expensive from doha and whether holiday packages are common i had a quick look on the doha s regency travel and tours website and the choice of packages shown online is extremely limited is this representative or are there lots of travel agents on the high streets that can arrange regular holiday packages at a reasonable price many thanks sarah 
sadly there is only one short answer no and there is no highstreet either 
i am currently working here in qatar our employer informed us that they will transfer to contractor with less salary but we have option not to accept but the problem is i have personal loan in one of the bank here in doha what if i will not accept the offer what will happen to me i mean did the bank will force to pay or not 
haha so you want to get away without paying the loan 
i just got my loan 6 months ago and i been terminated by the company what will be the procedures with the bank regarding my loan my company is not giving release is there any chance that my company will release me to continue paying my loan is there an insurance for all personal loans if there is how long it will take to get the clearance from the bank please advised 
there is insurance but it applies on death only so you have to find a job if the company where you find already is in approved list no need to worry just present the offer letter a letter from the company new that your visa is under process on receipt of letter please approach your branch if you do n t find a suitable job want travel ban so that you can find a suitable job please make sure that you give guarantee cheques against your loan to bank so they will do the rest if you already given cheque needs a clearance letter without payment of money you need a good guarantor 
can anyone advise on what the procedure is for us here in doha to get our dog here from sa how do i apply for the permit help please

my wife and i are moving to qatar in october from the usa texas she is a bit concerned on what is proper dress for women we have been told that anything is fine as long as her sholders are covered and her knees she is very upset about having to cover up when its 115 degrees outside what is acceptable 
as a woman here in qatar i encountered the same problem when i moved here last year i was told long sleeves and long skirts that is not entirely true esp in the summer when the heat is unbearable your wife can wear capris knees do need to be covered and short sleeved tops as long as the neckline is n t too low the benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants the general rule is that it should n t be too tight or two revealing also keep in mind that they run the a c on high everywhere so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants malls etc you are arriving in october so the weather will be fine like spring weather in the states very pleasant actually last winter it actually got quite cold here so bring jackets and even a light weight winter coat or heavier if you intend to travel during winter one other option a number of western women do wear abayas aro 
any advice on where to buy maternity clothes so far the few malls i ve looked has either a terrible selection i e a selection of 3 different items or the prices are out of control i m to the point of buying online and paying to ship any ideas please serious comments only i m in no mood for sarcastic silly male humor this morning 
hi minoush i think you probably tried these shops already ie mothercare marks and spencer bhs next yup selection is awful and prices are ouch have you tried h m they did have many trousers price range was 160 250qar the other thing to do would be to invest in good pair of basic colour trousers and get your tops stitched 
well as you all know there are many shopping malls over here in qatar such as city centre the mall lulu villagio etc so you all tell that from where you guyz like to do shopping 
villagio going to city centre only for cinema as soon as villagio cinema open i will never step my foot in city centre ever again lol 
when i was shopping at royal plaza i saw some traditional clothing that i fell in love with what do all the other expats think about qatars traditional clothing www noblesseoblige us 
this shop is designer abayas worn to parties and such you dont see many of these stunners in public i own 2 from this shop and they are getting pretty dusty no time for parties kids are too demanding  diplomacy is the art of saying nice doggie until you can find a rock will rogers 
is it in appropriate for western men to wear a thoub and shumagg they look very comfortable especially during the summer i wanted to get one but i don t want to offend anyone or do anything inappropriate 
only in halloween emancipate yourselves from mental slavery none but ourselves can free our minds 
why only a few muslim womens wear hijab why not others is hijab making a women outdated plz share your comments 
i do n t think it s possible to make women outdated but hijab might be coming outdated yes 
do women wear open toe or closed toe shoes in qatar what is an acceptable height of heel what women s shoes are accepted in qatari culture are expat women held to the same standard regarding shoes as qatari women thanks in advance 
yes we wear sandals flip flops open toe high heals all types and colors depends on the occasion temperature etc i live in doha yes salam

hi every body eid mubarak do some one no whey they r stopping ppl on foort to go to cornich i must have a car to go in happy eid 
all i can say is that i drove up to and on part of the corniche ealier today and yes i saw police and security men stopping people walking to the corniche it seemed fine to just park up in a car noticed most of the people they were stopping were groups of men today for many was a well earned rest day to spend time with family and friends i can only assume that someone was going to travel on the corniche and they did not want them to see the reality of qatar hard workers i do have to admit it did seem like security were stopping only labour men in their casual clothes who on a day off wish to do nothing than walk innocently on the corniche with friends hey this is qatar and they can do what they like when they like

hi everyone very nice to meet you all my wife and i are moving to doha in about 3 weeks as i m going to be working most days my wife and i are a little concerned about what she ll be able to do to keep her occupied during the day we were thinking of getting her enrolled at an esl school she does n t speak much english besides take courses what do other non expat spouses do to keep busy thanks everyone hope to meet some of you after we arrive 
hi nice to meet you hope your move goes well it can be difficult finding things to occupy your time here especially when you re new i m not sure where you re going to be living i live in an apartment block with my husband and it has no communal areas so have found it hard to meet and get to know my neighbours i think compound life is a bit more sociable anyway a couple of ideas the intercontinental hotel the one near katara not intercont the city has a special offer on tuesdays and wednesdays ladies pay only 50 qr to access their pool pool area i take yoga classes with yama yoga http yamayogastudios com they are lovely and might be another way to meet people also not sure what nationality language your wife speaks but there are a number of associations for different nationalities here buy a copy of marhaba magazine when you arrive they have an up to date list of them with contact details so she could socialise with people who speak her language 
is cycling in doha with the family viable or does the heat and road conditions make it unwise any parks work going round trying to figure out if its worth bringing our bikes across 
you would n t want to cycle in this traffic environment no cycle paths or respect for cyclists that being said there are one or two cycling clubs you could contact for accurate info but you would have to google for them smaller kids ride their bikes inside their compounds 
hi just in to doha does anyone out there play or know of any volleyball happening in doha either competitive or social if not is anyone interested in starting something up i m happy to try to arrange things but it will take me a little time to find my way around venues etc

is there a carseat law in qatar is there a selection of carseats to buy in doha 
the carseat law here is a joke the fine for having a child in your lap in the front seat is the same as talking on a hand held cell phone i ve asked our pediatrician why there has n t been an all out education campaign but no one knows 25 year behind syndrome i guess carseats are available though 
anybody out here doing triathlon can you suggest the best pool around doha to do lap swimming safest route for biking and running i just want to get back in shape 
seems like we re looking for the same thing around here i m pretty new here in qatar and i ve been in search for a lap pool nearby where i can continue my training or at least keep myself fit after reading several posts here seems like those that are easily accessible for a fee are hotel pools as for running the only route i ve tried so far is at the corniche i usually start near the sheraton hotel and go the opposite end then back biking on the other hand have n t tried yet as i did n t bring my bike here my friends advised me not to since it s not a safe place to bike due to the hot weather and also crazy drivers on the road although i m still planning to buy a bike eventually and look for a long stretch of road outside the city where one can go cover several kms during the cold season

hi all i know that qatar has a censored internet so is skype and any other similiar phone services blocked what kind of stuff does the qatar internet block and does it get annoying to the point that you might need to switch to un censored service such as orbit please advice thanks 
we do n t have a problem with skype being blocked we use it to talk to family regularly 
my family and i are moving to qatar next year we lived in saudi 10 years ago a co worker said expat men and women can wear shorts in public in qatar i find that extremely difficult to believe what s the truth thanks kevin in houston 
ok or not ok for men to wear shorts in public malls corniche etc i know there is no law against it i am just asking for peoples opinions please 
as long as it is tuxedo or latex 
my wife and i are moving to qatar in october from the usa texas she is a bit concerned on what is proper dress for women we have been told that anything is fine as long as her sholders are covered and her knees she is very upset about having to cover up when its 115 degrees outside what is acceptable 
as a woman here in qatar i encountered the same problem when i moved here last year i was told long sleeves and long skirts that is not entirely true esp in the summer when the heat is unbearable your wife can wear capris knees do need to be covered and short sleeved tops as long as the neckline is n t too low the benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants the general rule is that it should n t be too tight or two revealing also keep in mind that they run the a c on high everywhere so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants malls etc you are arriving in october so the weather will be fine like spring weather in the states very pleasant actually last winter it actually got quite cold here so bring jackets and even a light weight winter coat or heavier if you intend to travel during winter one other option a number of western women do wear abayas aro 
hi all are you able to clarify what is considered appropriate attire for females at the beach and gym thanks 
swimwear at the beach and workout clothes at the gym easy really unless of course it s a public beach and you do n t see any other females wearing swimwear then you should n t either hotel beach is a safe bet so are the remote areas by the inland sea 
just a question is it acceptable for men and women to wear flip flops when walking around the streets and in shopping centres or do we always have to wear closed shoes thanks 
flip flops are fine as long as you have n t got minging feet 
hi there does anyone know what beaches are cool to go to safe clean sandy where i can go with my daughter to i have tried calling some of the hotels though the beaches are for member only s west bay is fairly close to me but is there any part of it i can go to without paying charges or through an hotel which actually lets non members in thanks 
sea line msaieed wakra near airport dukhan or al khor check the cultural village they have a nice beach and i dont think its an expensive memebership 
what s the worst that s going to happen if i continue to wear these in the hot summer months i m 25 and coming from the states i do n t really feel like overhauling my summer wardrobe iwas told to wear long pants and long sleeves to go about town but that is crazy does n t it get up to 110 degrees there i meeannn come on comments advice thanks 
your not likely to be walking about anywhere outside in the summer at least during the day malls public places cover up or face the consequences 
omg someone just told me that you can get a fine if you wear sleeveless or short s is this true big shock 
this is an islamic country and you should dress accordingly modest dress at all times where s the big shock 
hello i will be moving to usa soon to take up a job i have heard many stories about the place regarding clothes can you please advice on what to wear i do n t want to stand out do i have to wear cowboy boots like mr george bush 
you will know what to wear when you get there 
q130 
yess ofcourse u can use it anywhere no prob at all infact u can use any sort of dress in qatar 
hi all i m back with yet another question thanks for bearing with me here just wondering what most women wear at the pool beach in health clubs would you be uncomfortable in bikinis i read about the bikini ban at the diplomatic club can you wear shorts to walk around in a health club i seem to be getting mixed views on this and am just curious as to what most women wear much thanks 
whatever you wear you will be stared at in qatar specially if you are good looking make sure to go to all female health club if you dont want to get unwanted attention and stares i just started going to gold gym and even there people raised eye brows when they saw me in shorts so i have switched to long trousers just to avoid the unwanted attention i think some people here in qatar have a serious problem of staring specially at the female gender 
i m going to resign my present job thr will be 2 years ban and i wan na comeback to qatar for visit visa is it possible 
hi plz let me know whether the 2 yrs ban in qatar is still there if our employer is not providing noc to change to a new firm is there any alternative option for the employee or is ban reduced to 6 months for professionals 
my friend if you are completing you visa duration and going back to your country then you can come in 6 month but if you are going within visa duration then you can not come for 2 years in qatar 
i just want to ask if there is new rules about the ban in qatar once you are cancelled is there any ways to comeback and seek for a job again 
no new rules if you ca n t get a noc to transfer your rp yes there is a way to work again here wait out the 2 year ban 
i was can canceled by my company one month ago now i m here in the philippines i want to go back to qatar i want to know after how many months must i wait before i can go back again to qatar please help me 
24 months mandi 
a friend of mine got deported in february and he needs my help he is not a criminal no he had problems with his manager and they didnt get to an agreement the company couldnt release him and his stubborness got him deported his rp was only cancelled normally as a normal exit and he doesnt have a deportee sticker on his passport is there any chance for him to return to doha and who has this information can i call someone and check if he can return back immigration maybe 
the best person to answer this would be your pr guys in principle he can return 
hello everyone i m already here in qatar a month ago under business visa with my sponsor do i still need an noc in order to apply for another company here in qatar if ever i decide to go home on the 3 month period of the business visa thanks 
yes you indeed need an noc in original if you need to go back and come back to qatar basically you will need old noc as well as new noc from the current employer you have arrived her regards felix pereira 
when not getting a noc does a 2 year ban mean a 2 year ban from working or a 2 year ban from entering qatar again 
as far as i am concerned that law still exist and it does not change until now mo rin yun lang 
will i get a gcc ban ban if i go on leave and does n t come back during my contract period in qatar please give me an answer 
just a ban in qatar not gcc 
hi everyone i worked in qatar on april 2006 up to october 2009 i went to vacation with re entry visa but did not come back i dont have noc and final exit visa it is already 2 years 3 months ago i got a job offer now in qatar i just want to ask if there will be no problem for my future employer in applying visa for me how will i check or how will i know if my ban is already finished 
i think there is a small catch here though what if his employer realized that he is absconding and put a ban on him in feb 2010 instead of applying for a ban immediately to be on the safer side you can count 2 years from the date of your visa expired 
i m planning to resign in my company by next year just finishing my contract for almost 2 years can i come back in less than a year or not i ve heard that if working here in qatar for more than 2 years you can come back in least than a year without having an noc how true is that hoping for positve response to all of you guys thanks 
without noc you will get a 2 year ban 
i am currently working here in qatar our employer informed us that they will transfer to contractor with less salary but we have option not to accept but the problem is i have personal loan in one of the bank here in doha what if i will not accept the offer what will happen to me i mean did the bank will force to pay or not 
haha so you want to get away without paying the loan

hi everyone very nice to meet you all my wife and i are moving to doha in about 3 weeks as i m going to be working most days my wife and i are a little concerned about what she ll be able to do to keep her occupied during the day we were thinking of getting her enrolled at an esl school she does n t speak much english besides take courses what do other non expat spouses do to keep busy thanks everyone hope to meet some of you after we arrive 
hi nice to meet you hope your move goes well it can be difficult finding things to occupy your time here especially when you re new i m not sure where you re going to be living i live in an apartment block with my husband and it has no communal areas so have found it hard to meet and get to know my neighbours i think compound life is a bit more sociable anyway a couple of ideas the intercontinental hotel the one near katara not intercont the city has a special offer on tuesdays and wednesdays ladies pay only 50 qr to access their pool pool area i take yoga classes with yama yoga http yamayogastudios com they are lovely and might be another way to meet people also not sure what nationality language your wife speaks but there are a number of associations for different nationalities here buy a copy of marhaba magazine when you arrive they have an up to date list of them with contact details so she could socialise with people who speak her language 
does anyone know when city centre or villaggio are open 
does anyone know what stores will be in the villagio when will it open what new stores are being added to city center 
villagio is already open and it is a carbon copy of city centre do n t expect anything exciting 
does anyone hae any updates or ideas when the cinema in villagio will open or any new cinema at that there s signs saying opening soon around villagio but that ambiguous at best i m really itching to watch a good movie 
villaggio cinema there are other cinemas in doha like city centre mall etc why are you so desperate to watch movie in villagio 
which mall is more accessible for your needs just wondering how an individual deal with comfortness when it comes to visiting malls in doha city thank you 
villagio stack of parking all the time 
if you d just arrived in doha and wanted to look around some malls to learn about what goods are available and the prices drink coffee and hang out to catch the vibes what two malls would you go to first thanks 
depends on where you re staying i would go for city center first as i think you get a good impression there and then maybe villaggio but after city center the other ones seem to be small i still prefer city center and villaggio depends on what i want to buy hyatt plaza was a bit disappointing for me and unfortunately i have n t made it to landmark so far 
well as you all know there are many shopping malls over here in qatar such as city centre the mall lulu villagio etc so you all tell that from where you guyz like to do shopping 
villagio going to city centre only for cinema as soon as villagio cinema open i will never step my foot in city centre ever again lol 
which is your favourite supermarket shopping mall i love carrefour and megamarkt and city center and villaggio but somehow from lulu hypermarket it just freaks me out i do n t know why what about you 
mega mart is the best i think for variety and choice it is the most expensive which is a little annoying still have to do some shopping around to get exactly the things i want ca n t stand carrefour fresh food is not that good 
does anyone know that when the villagio mall will reopen and will it be shifted to some other place if yes then which area any idea or does anyone know about it 
they will not open villagio 
i have been here since november and not managed to get a decent haircut yet any recommendations 
four seasons do mens hair on sundays there s also one in salam shopping mall i think the sheraton have one also beverly hills tower have one but he s on holiday at the moment 
i read that they will open a branch at villagio can anyone inform me more about this cant wait if true i literally live 2 min away from villagio 
why not contacting them and confirming that info best of luck

hey there i was wondering of anyone knew if there would be any fireworks anywhere this evening for new year we are spending a relatively quiet night in with the family but wondered of it would be worth making it up to the roof at midnight eg if any hotels were doing fireworks that we may be able to see from the al sadd area thanks in advance xxx

what when where did you google it first 
so is it eid now 
a second canon went off just after the iftar one this evening but to be honest i think first day of eid will be wednesday 1 oct 
please do n t eat me alive that this topic is not about doha but i would like to know if there will be any fireworks in dubai at new year and where i searched on the internet but only found about last year so if you have any information do n t hesitate to tell me thank you 
fireworks hmmmm wait lem me think hmmmmmm still thinking hmmmmm so on

i have noticed taht the fireworks and the festivals here in doha have become less and less during the previous 3 years tehre were no fireworks and tehre were no good festivals happening this eid whats gone wrong 
yeah dun know why qatar govt is n t entertaining us lol allow and disallow the facts and infacts

so we re probably going to be moving from texas shortly after my husband moves if i can find a school for my 2 kids in elem school here and a daycare for the toddler do people not answer emails in qatar must get phonecard in the meantime is it a good idea to look for a place to live only after we know where the schools will be

we are relocating from south africa in july and i have literally applied to all the british and american schools for my 4 years son and been refused by each of them we have however been lucky to get a spot at acs doha i know its a new school but has anyone heard anything about it and is there confirmation of whether they follow american or british curriculum 
as you say it s a new school so it s difficult to confirm anything i believe the buildings are not yet 100 complete but it s nothing for you to worry about since the school year will only start in september good luck with the move and with the heat when you get here 
hii i have one doughter who is 4 5 years old she will be 5 years old next july we are looking for international school for 2012 2013 education period begin to next september could you advise me international school not we are looking for mix type schools not girls schools regards

can anyone give me some basic info on the american high school in doha my husband is currently working there and we are trying to decide if our son and i should come or not he will be entering 9th grade next school year good student very involved in sports gridiron football and baseball any information would be much appreciated thanks 
http www asd edu qa pages sitepage cfm page 32659 above is the link for asd american school of doha we do n t have kids but i am a teacher and we have heard wonderful things about asd i believe but can stand to be corrected that they are in the process of building a new middle high school campus expected to be open for the 2007 2008 school year one thing i would consider is whether or not your son will be able to come here and remain here for all of high school while the transition to a school in doha may be pretty easy the transition back to a school in the states to complete say senior year might be a challenge just something to consider we moved here from the states a couple of months ago so please feel free to email us if you have any other questions good luck 
with all the long waiting lists for children getting into the private schools what happens are there many home school groups or private tutor groups in doha or do families go back to their home countries until they can get a place any feedback on this will be appreciated 
i do n t know if this is a very popular option there is a tutoring place here called cedars and i think some people use this while they are waiting for school places tel 468 8192 email cedarstutoring hotmail com getting school places is a problem in doha but if you have a british passport you have a better chance than some because you will be given priority in the british curriculum schools i m sure you ve probably researched which ones are popular here any that come under the umbrella of bsme british schools of the middle east and are not for profit are generally sound they have a website www bsme org uk obviously the best option would be to come over to doha on a look see visit so that you can check out the schools yourself in any event if you are looking for places to start september 2007 you need to act now as it may take 3 6 months to go through the process of applying entrance tests for secondary children etc if have children at secondary and primary level i would

hi there i do keep harping on about this but with schools commencing in only 6 days hysteria is at its peak so if please advise and pls share your experience if your only choices for now were newton british in al waab or loydence academy in al azizya which would u chose of did you choose and why did newtons overall reputation affect your disregarding newton british many many thanks

hi everyone my husband has just got a job with qatar airways and i m hoping to get my three children into a british school in doha in september 2012 i need a place in year 3 year 2 and reception can anybody advise on how likely that is i m not sure if i should stay in the uk until i can get the children into a school or could that be a really long wait any information would be greatly received many thanks xx 
wait and only apply to doha english speaking school if they get accepted then leave the uk this school is only british school which follow the actual british curriculum and is monitored by the british educational council all the rest of the british school claim they follow the british curriculum who is there to monitor the school if you pay for a private company to accredit the school they will come out and give you accreditation you will find out that your child will be a year behind because majority of the schools do n t have the textbooks for each subject in the class nor do they have a curriculum without textbooks or manuals sadly the teachers have to deal with the parents as to why their child is behind because the principal will pond you over to the teacher for any complaints

where do i pay a speeding ticket fine the www moi gov qa website says that i got my picture taken last month i ve heard that most people do n t pay fines until they come to sell the car i ve also heard that the fine gets increased by 10 for every month it is n t paid i d rather pay now thanks 
you used to be able to pay it online at the e government site but that s been under maintenance for a long time now go to the traffic department either at madinat khalifa or airport to pay you need to renew your car s road permit once a year that s when uou have to do a traffic violations check before they renew the permit fines do n t increase you just have to pay it when your road permit is up or if you re involved in a car accident they check for violations then

what happened here seems to me some of us were having a sensible discussion about prostitution in qatar and the thread vanished am i missing something i did not see anything deserving of sensoring editing unless we look at the original post and i am sure that could have been dealt with seperately and so keeping the thread alive or is it being implied that we bury our head in the sand and pretend it does not exist here can we continue here 
it s not that china it was deleted because the thread was trolling and promoting prostitution such threads that promote something whether it was prostitution or otherwise gets deleted but it was n t cause of the topic itself so we can continue here

ive lived in uae bahrain saudi when it comes to renting a place the commission is paid by the landlord he has hired this agent to find a person to rent the apartment isnt it his job to pay the person he hired why do we have to pay the person who put an advertisement in the newspaper just because he showed us the flat we have to pay half the rent to him in other areas in the middle east the landlord pays not us please advice

okay im not sure if this is appropiate as i am not trying to offend anyone but i keep hearing some middle eastern people tell me that the qatari weddings are known for getting down and dirty behind all these smiles no one tells me what this means what the heck happens at these weddings i would really like to know 
i ve only been to one but if you mean dull as dogshit when you say down and dirty than i guess thats right the parties are separated into two groups men and women and there is no alcohol at least at the womens parties they dance to loud disco music and dress scantily for other women while critizing what every other woman is wearing not exactly the greatest party of all time

is there anyone in this forum who works at the intercontinental hotel i d like to ask some questions thanks 
i have business dealings with the intercon 
select which phone connection is best vodafone or qtel why 
they try to compensate by giving free minutes which you can not use as the reception is very poor maybe the happy ending is this knowing after all the unreturned phonecalls brokenhearts through the blunders and misread signals through the pain and embarrassment you never gave up hope 
qtel offers 512k 1mb and 2mb adsl for 200 300 or 400qr per month i am moving to a place where i will have to decide which subscription would like some advice from experienced people is the extra speed worth it is the speed difference noticeable i ask the question because the place where i am living now provides an internet connection via a cable and the speed of the connection varies a lot 
we have the 200 qr month and i find it very fast it does slow down from time to time but overall i m happy with it 
please share your experiances how was your first day in qatar did you join the same day what happened etc etc i will be there from 17th of this month

my canadian son and girlfriend want to visit at christmas with their new baby for 2 weeks as they are not married will this be a problem i am not interested in hearing any opinions on their marital status just the facts please 
i do n t think so but let them not mention anything about them being not married no one s gunna ask whether they re married or not i think but if you really wan na check then talk to someone who feels very confident about it my pick is that they ll be fine d 
hi everyone i m currently negotiating a position i have been told they will only include my partner in the package if we are married this is n t an option at this stage i would like her to have the option to be able to live with me in doha whether its permanent or not is another issue any advice on how i can make this happen appreciate all your help 
i was in a similar condition in 1990 i married my girlfriend and the problems disappeared it s that easy 
hello all a few weeks ago i had a friend visiting from abroad so i booked a room in sealine for one night but due to bad weather we could n t go so now i am stuck with the room i was thinking of taking my girlfriend for the weekend but they have this marriage certificate rule my question is is this rule really implemented could we go and i check in by myself then meet up with her and spend a fun day at the beach thank you for your help 
depends on your nationality 
i will be arriving in doha on the 10th or 11th of december my wife will be flying in approximately two weeks later and will be staying with me on my sponsorship for the duration of my contract when she steps off of the plane in doha she will have her passport but i do n t know what else she needs in order to stay in the country with me can she get some sort of visitor visa or what i am not sure what to do here thanks everyone 
i am not too sure on all the formailities however would suggest that you get in touch with your embassy as far as i know yor wife needs a rp residence permit which can only be done once you have yours if she come on the visit visa she will only be able to stay a few months and will have no rights hospital bank account finding a job etc not to say that she can not come on the visit visa but she would have to leave after the visa expired and apply for a residency under your name from her country unless she has her own sponslor in qatar 
is this even possible i have read that unmarried and or married couples staying together in a hotel room were not required to present their marriage certificates before they check in if this is possible what hotel can you suggest can anybody shed a light on this stuff thanks in advance 
irene this is an islamic country and once at the hotel reception you could be asked to provide a proof marriage certificate so that way you are allowed to stay together in the same room otherwise the hotel staff could call the police and report you then you ll be in deep trouble really deep so better stay on the safe side

hello guys good day i want to ask about the profession in the qatar id iam ready to go home anytime to my country to channge my visa into husband sponsor but they tell us we will have a problem with this case the profession of husband in qatar id is waiter but he is safety coordinator in ras laffan his salary is more than 7000qr do we have to change this before i go home thank you very much 
is confusing 1 you say you are ready to go back home and change visa to husband sponsorship do you already have a work visa here or are you here on a visit visa 2 he is a safety coordinator in what company if it is qatar gas qatar petroleum etc the hr there can arrange for the family visa in spite of the profession problems 3 if you are here on a visit visa and want to come back on husband sponsorship then he his company has to submit all relevant documents to the government and get his profession changed on the visa this is on the sole desecration of the employer as he might not have a visa which suits his job 
i have my papers under process for evaluation at sch and the result was as follows evaluation pending sit for exam i have scheduled my exam on the 31st of may here in the philippines but i only have 2 yrs experience if i pass the prometric exam is there a chance for me to pass the evaluation asl well thank you 
kamusta kabayan to sum up all the process required by the sch qatar you need these 4 very major important things 1 passed the prometric exam 2 minimum 2 years paid hospital or clinical experience volunteer isnt counted and considered 3 bs nursing degree holder 4 registered nurse with active license not expired in your home country the evaluation which will be conducted by dataflow is just one of the steps for you able to get licensed here fyi dataflow doesnt need your prometric exam in the evaluation stage dataflow will only needs the 2 3 4 once u ve passed the evaluation you will proceed to licensing stage for you able to pass this stage you need to pass the prometric

well done gypsy i was just gon na tell him to do a search but your cut and paste does the same job did you google it first 
i m fairly new to qatar for those who legally enjoy an alcoholic beverage what is your favorite place besides your own home the couple bars i ve tried are too pretentious and sterile to call a home away from home i d appreciate some suggestions 
this topic is inappropriate as alcohol is only allowed for a minority here as a gesture of tolerance 
last wednesday i was walking along al saad street entered cloud nyn at mewrab hotel for the first time but they didnot allow this single gentle man in only couples entry are there more bars in doha which allow only couples and ladies 
yep heaps of places you can go to oasis though they always let single men in which is why there are absolutely no women in there but its a fun night anyway its a rule they make to try to achieve some balance in the nightclubs even in australia a group of men ca n t get into some nightclubs its a shame for you i guess 
hi everyone i m from london and considering taking a job in doha and want to ensure that i find accommodation in an area where i will find other young single people i m a 28 year old woman where in doha would be the equivalent of old street in london or williamsburg in new york where do the young artists musicians fashion designers live i d really like to find an area that has a creative community all advice much appreciated 
nowhere in doha you will find like the old street london williamsburg ny 
okay im not sure if this is appropiate as i am not trying to offend anyone but i keep hearing some middle eastern people tell me that the qatari weddings are known for getting down and dirty behind all these smiles no one tells me what this means what the heck happens at these weddings i would really like to know 
i ve only been to one but if you mean dull as dogshit when you say down and dirty than i guess thats right the parties are separated into two groups men and women and there is no alcohol at least at the womens parties they dance to loud disco music and dress scantily for other women while critizing what every other woman is wearing not exactly the greatest party of all time 
i have been offered jobs both in dubai and in doha i will be visiting in sept to look at both places and form an opinion for myself i get the impression the lifestyle is better in qatar less traffic easier to move around etc accomadation is cheaper in dubai can you give me your pro s and cons on both places appreciated jr 
qatar is less developed than dubai but it s on the rise and will be a large construction site for the next decade accommodation is just as expensive in dubai if not a little more qatar is a less hectic place than dubai if you do a search qatar dubai on this forum you can get an idea of what has been said in the past 
who s the best dj newsreader and announcer on qbs

what would happen and what would the authorities do about it and in your own opinion what do you think of this issue ps no i am not doing it im just happening to ask it just occured to me 
i ve heard that even if a married couple were caught kissing in public they would be penalized kissing in public in general is not recommended even if authorities did n t catch u u would stared at and given bad looks and i think we should respect the culture of the country we re in so i would say u should n t make a huge romantic scene in the mall if u can save it till home i think to avoid all the hassle just keep ur relationship discreet in public

in my opinion the most effective is avg some people do n t like it as it is system intensive meaning it slows your computer down while the scan is running however in terms of the most up to date virus protection and a very thorough daily computer check it is one of the better ones

am i the only one who seems to experience a problem with taxis that do n t slow down to pick you up when quite obviously you are waiting for their service it has happened to me a number of times where about 2 or 3 taxis bypass me even after i have waved them down it makes no sense why on earth would they just keep driving surely they are contractually bound to pick up fares if they are on duty is anyone else finding the same thing x 
do not get me started with them even after all this more and more taxis they do not seem to improve i have called in the past outside rydges around midnite there were maybe 30 karwas waiting outside but i called to order for a taxi from qbc qatar bowling centre maybe 200 metres away and they told me they had no taxis for 1 hour i then went into and told them a little about themselves and their incompetency i have had the experience sooooooooooo many times like you if only they stopped they d know that i was going exactly the direction their going i have no idea what is going on there but its sheer incompetency do they know if their hiring i d like to go there and sort them out for the benefit of us all whilst i m there i might as well work for ashgal too i m actually sure anyone with common sense and basic business skills could do a much better job than them over and out 
i have been told that the qatari government is about to introduce a minimum wage of 1460 qr per month for house maids the sponsor having to pay it directly into the employee s bank account anyone with more information 
there was a meeting held at philippine embassy last week and they tackled about this matter one of the requirements in submitting agreements in embassy is labor contract signed by the sponsor indicating the salary of 400 we are still waiting for the confirmation of the additional requirement once the labor contract will be attached to the housemaid s agreement the indicated salary will be implemented 
anyone here who s a filipino working for hamad medical center was it ok to work there as a filipino who will be getting qr 6 500 is that enough 
is that qr 6500 altogether including your allowances or is it just you basic salary 
if i were to make 40 000 qr a month total compensation and want to send two kids to the american school roughly 90 000 qr per year and rent a villa in a compound for 12000 qr per month plus other expenses etc such as landline internet access groceries etc will that suffice for a family of four any thoughts would be much appreciated

do you think u can live without man or women in our life 
me no i cant live without man in my life 
so me and a friend were just discussing this and we have conflicting ideas i think that if a man really loves and respects his wife then he will not wander off to an another s lady s arms when his wife is or is n t around my friend on the other hand thinks that no matter what men will eventually wander and be seduced by other women what do y all think 
monogamy is a very odd thing very few animals practice true monogamny mainly birds i think men wander because it s in there genes to spread their bloodline as far as possible and they will chase a fertile female it s a dreadful habit 
iam here in qatar for about 6 1 2 years many people have said to me that they are happy about the qatari youngsters attitiude towards the women because these guys are not starring at our wives daughters in a bad sense like we experience in our countries do you think it is right if yes no then why 
yes it is right qataris are interested in arabic ladies or any lady exposing her body openly i have seen them following only arabic ladies they just stare at western ladies 
how feasible is it to drive to abu dhabi or dubai from doha dukhan is it true that women are n t permitted to drive in saudi how long would the journey be roughly

recent polls have shown one fifth of americans ca n t locate us on a world map why do you think this is 
1 inability to resore complete freedom to the iraqis failure 2 inappropriate curbs on gun control policies 3 thriving 1bn porn industry 4 excessive anti immigrant laws due to preconceived notions about other nationalities 
what the hell i asked what s the situation with marijuana in qatar meaning like what are the laws is it common etc and my question got deleted because it s illegal i guess that s so dumb because what if you want to know the laws there and what if what ever your asking is illegal in qatar you could risk going to jail because you were n t informed of this 
come on big guy you should know the answer drugs and booze among other things are illegal in this country 
why is polygamy bigamy is considered a crime in the west crime in what sense what if the wife agrees and is cheating on wife having a permanent girlfriend besides her considered an equally serious crime and why why is polygamy bigamy prohibited while prostitution and same sex marriage are being legalized it is said that even in islamic countries bigamy is limited so why is the west so scared about it 
economic issues taxes and benefits but do n t know for sure i think if everyone agrees and they can support themselves they should n t be penalized but i do think that children are made the unwitting partners in these situations and it can be very very hard on them they do n t actually get to consent and the choice is made for them i do n t think the west is scared at all about polygamy they simply do n t approve of it in their societies it s their right is n t it please note prostitution is not legalized in the us except in one strange county in nevada that i have never understood nor is same sex marriage except in a very few cases i refuse to drink the kool aid pm 
i have a serious question to those nonmuslims who work in qatar now after living in an islamic country do you find the islam something different from that you were hearing about before if yes is this difference positive or negative in your openion what are the reasons of the difference between the real islam and your previous background do you think now you have a complete image about what is islam or you need more time 
i had a better image of islam when i was back in india 
why is it that asian people especially from philipines overuse the word sir so much it is like the start and end of every phrase they say i respect the fact that they are polite tho but too much politeness is also annoying sometimes unless if their job security depends on saying this word so much 
why do some people want to act like a holes all the time i know it gives them some meaning to their otherwise useless existence but it gets annoying after a while unless their job security depends on it       you lost me 
whenever i ask a keralite if he is from india his answer will be no am from kerala so am wondering if kerala is not part of india and its in the us or thialand or wherever i feel there is so much hate between keralite and other part of india specialy mumbai and delhi also in a company where the manager is a keralite the preference of hiring emlpyees goes to keralite only and not other indian any idea 
racism nationalism patriotism all the good virtues of a citizen a la flor create that mess 
what happened here seems to me some of us were having a sensible discussion about prostitution in qatar and the thread vanished am i missing something i did not see anything deserving of sensoring editing unless we look at the original post and i am sure that could have been dealt with seperately and so keeping the thread alive or is it being implied that we bury our head in the sand and pretend it does not exist here can we continue here 
it s not that china it was deleted because the thread was trolling and promoting prostitution such threads that promote something whether it was prostitution or otherwise gets deleted but it was n t cause of the topic itself so we can continue here 
klm have told me my yorkshire terrier is able to travel in the cabin with me from the u k to doha has anyone done this 2 pet relocation companies have told me i cant and im unsure whether they are telling me this to avoid getting their fee or whether i have been misinformed by klm cost is not the issue the wellbeing of our wonderful pet is i really want the most stress free method of travel possible for her can anyone help

we have a 4 year old acer laptop with the following specs intel celeron 2 0 ghz m 256 mb ddr sdram 30gb ultra ata 100 hdd 8x dvd rom only using it to check emails and hubby plays pc games but sometimes memory runs low can laptops be upgraded does it cost a lot or is it better to buy a new one i believe there are a lot of ql experts here for advise 
if your only using it for checking email that laptop is still good but if your hubby are playing games it will really make the memory low because all programs eat tons of memory but it depends on the game anyway back to the topic i really advise to buy a new one because upgrading is not really advisable but that is only my opinion 
any pc modders here any hardcore gamers around if yes then this is the place for you all discussing about pc modifications building higher end rigs computer related discussions doubts anything 
how do you define hardcore gaming

i came across this editorial on how muslim men were supposedly intimidated by well educated females in their thirties when it came to choosing a wife http www altmuslimah com a b rsa 4291 this raises the larger question do you think men in general regardless of religion prefer to marry someone who is younger and less educated are marriages more successful when the woman is less educated and younger than the man 
if you did n t want religion to be discussed then would n t it have been more advisable to just ask the larger question o

hi tashkent first i m a local so i might not be fair in giving you a clear opinion about us well like every society there is the good bad the ugly according to statistics the highest percentage of the population is concentrated on the ages 20 30 unfortunately you ll find allot of shallow youth wondering on shopping malls with no interest in education employment religion or life matters their only concern is having a posh car with unique number as if it really matters yet there are some educated youth socializing and volunteering in good deeds unfortunately they are outnumbered by the shallow 1 s

hey guys i m a nurse here in the phils i just signed a contract for hamad as a staff nurse the offer is 5600 qatar riyals per month plus 1000 qatar riyal for transportation allowance is that a great deal how about the free accommodation does it look good i m anxious about my new job help pls 
regarding the starting salary if it is your 1st stint to work as nurse overseas that looks to be fair with regard to the transportation allowance of qr1 000 month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital are located in the same city i mean if you will be assigned in al khor or somewhere far and your accomodation is in doha then that might need to be adjusted hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff gets housing allowance i am not a nurse but i know some nurse working with hamad hamad is a government hospital and in general they give higher salary than the private clinics hospitals can you provide me hamad s agency and contact address in the philippines as it could also be an option for my nurse daughter in the future she just passed the nursing board exam and barely starting her 1st job this month

m e s started refusing admission to certain nationals back in 1998 there rationale was that students from certain background can be a disruptive influence critics were in peace back then now it is simply ridiculous why refuse admission to non indian nationals is the eduction ministry aware of this there should be tough rules and fines for this i know of no private schools in qatar or overseas which conduct in such non ethical fashion 
first time i am seeing a person from an australian background wants an admission in an indian school cant believe it 
in general i find arab people are not gentle i am telling that from my 14 years of experience in the gulf i mean most of them are rude i see it in every segment of people not only higher class can anyone tell me if that is ego problem superiority complex or something else i know every where we will find bad mannered people but in arab s you will find plenty of the them yesterday i faced the same in customer service i doubt in jarir book shop 
lol i really dont know why but i also know plenty of arabs that are kind and respectful people poverty is not for the sake of hardship no it is there because nothing exists but god poverty unlocks the door what a blessed key jalaluddin al rumi

okie the fast moving cars have been the hottest topic on ql since ages but what about those slow moving cars do n t you think there should be a penalty for slow movers as well i mean drivers here are at two extremes which makes the traffic horrible is n t it

even it is a strange topic and will sound funny to most of you but someone might explain it in a good way each qatari id number contains information about your date of birth and country etc i exactly do n t know the sequence but if someone have good knowledge please share it here which numbers stands for what i am sure there are only 4 figures of serial number others are personal information about the holder

my profession shown in my residence visa is technician whereas in reality i am working as manager i tried to change my profession from technician to manager through our agent but for some reason he is saying it is not possible i have masters in business administration and masters in geology i really wonder why this change ca n t be done does any body has any suggestion of how to do this change 
to change the profession there is a charge of qr 550 he does n t want to pay for it that is the reason 
is there anyway to avoid the requirement of a noc if you want to change a job and your employer does not want to give you a noc 
if someone got terminated for no reason why on the earth the company would refuse to give a noc letter you both terminate me and don t want me to work with any other company as well w h y what is that nonsense isn t it basic human rights abuse and simple humiliation 
it is always their privilege if they want to issue the noc specially when they re the one who brought you here from your country it is always a matter of they would give it voluntarily or you ask for it nicely everyday i beat my own previous records for the number of days i have stayed alive 
hi hw many kinds of noc s are there and what do we mean by a temporary noc kindly enlighten 
no idea have n t heard that b4

after transfering your salary to the new bank in qatar and 1st salary reach the bank after only bank will give personal loans to you bank people are clever people not fools 
i am currently working here in qatar our employer informed us that they will transfer to contractor with less salary but we have option not to accept but the problem is i have personal loan in one of the bank here in doha what if i will not accept the offer what will happen to me i mean did the bank will force to pay or not 
haha so you want to get away without paying the loan 
i m currently in doha on a 3 month visit visa anybody can please tell me whether i can extend this futher more maximum of how many months 
maximum 6 months brother after that you have to exit from qatar 
i just got my loan 6 months ago and i been terminated by the company what will be the procedures with the bank regarding my loan my company is not giving release is there any chance that my company will release me to continue paying my loan is there an insurance for all personal loans if there is how long it will take to get the clearance from the bank please advised 
there is insurance but it applies on death only so you have to find a job if the company where you find already is in approved list no need to worry just present the offer letter a letter from the company new that your visa is under process on receipt of letter please approach your branch if you do n t find a suitable job want travel ban so that you can find a suitable job please make sure that you give guarantee cheques against your loan to bank so they will do the rest if you already given cheque needs a clearance letter without payment of money you need a good guarantor 
hi my husband will start work in qatar soon and we were wondering how is the work pace there is it typical regular hours 9 to 5 or does it involve much of overtime weekend work anyone with insides from the financial sector would be very helpful thanks sorry as i initially posted my question in the wrong place

i have heard that it 39 s really fun to drive from qatar to dubai on the weekend obviosly if you have a 4 x 4 drive my question is do i need to get a visa if i want to go to dubai if i have a residence permit of qatar 
although you can go to dubai and get visa on arrival if you are going by air but road travel is different you have to pass saudi border and you need saudi visa in order to get saudi visa you have to get uae visa first saudi gives visa only after you already have uae visa on your passport hope this clarifies

our company is recently downsizing and unfortunately i m one of those lucky ones that got terminated though our company promised us that they will provide us a release papers the big question is what will happen to my liabilities in my bank i have an outstanding loan and credit card thanks in advance guys and hope you can help me 
if the termination information is given to bank by your company hr department the bank will blocked your account they will immediately give access once you give them the appointment letter from new company provided that new company is listed in the same bank though your current company is not directly liable for your loan if possible request them not to inform bank for the time being and you can continue repay monthly installment to bank in cash or with available balance another option is to withdraw money for your few months expense till you get new job

i really need to find out the price of bottled water in qatar i would like to see the prices of high end bottled water like evian and need the price and the place that you priced it at it would help me out a lot if you could just jot down the prices of water at the local stores and post them for me or give me a link to a local store where i can look at their prices on the internet if possible thank you 
who is best in the market when it comes to supplying 5 gallon water at house i was told sabeel water is doing good and their service is also better than others what do you all say i need to set up one service for my house pls suggest 
well in my opinion almanhal is the best about home delivery that you have to check with them but i guess there shouldnt be a problem if ur prepared to order some good nos 
can anyone recommend a drinking water company that offers dispenser and water delivery i recently had to cancel my brand new agreement with a water company because the water tasted like plastic not sure if the taste came from the new dispenser or the water or both has anyone else had a similar experience here

i have two samples of aqua gulf water contaminated if this is the way we can never have mineral water bottle why to pay and buy poisonous water 
stop buying bottled water altogether will help the environment live with passion die with style 
hi guys i need your opinion about something is there anybody here using water filter instead of buying drinking water from shop is the tap water is safe to consume after using water filter thanks in advance 
yes am using a ro water purification system close to a year and it works perfect and we feel of having a 100 purified drinking water need to change filter every six months water from tap is good to drink but due to pipeline and untidy water tanks in your apartment you might need to buy install a panasonic water purifier which i think is more enough to purify fitler your tap water and start use that for drinking purposes i have the two in my house where i came in without knowing about panasonic being installed as part of furnished stuff it s better you avoid drinking botttled water they are meant for immediate needs good luck i have an article about this let me know your e mail id so to e mail you that stuff

hey buddies finally the flight is booked and i will arrive next week what gives me some kind of a headache is my excess baggage they ask for 33 00 euros per kilo has anybody a good idea how to deal with them in order to pay less maybe any chance of a rebate when i tell them i m gon na live in doha thanks for your help 
check to see if you send the luggage by air cargo if its cheaper 
looking on a couple of other threads and having read a couple of blogs tell me if i should pack in my excess baggage canned pumpkin chocolate chips pie pan and in household goods not sure if they will ship food diet root beer ziplock bags book supply curious about cookbooks though seriously i can get anything from the internet still you got your tried trues is it hard to find us measure cookbooks 
anyone have any ideas what the cost per kilo of excess baggage is from the uk to doha i have always thought for some unknown reason it was in the region of 10 of the airfare per kilo that sound reasonable 
depends on the airline check on their website they normally list these sort of things 
hi im travelling with my son via emirates and since he is more than 2 yrs old each of us has baggage allowance of 30kg packed all of our things and used the bathroom weighing scale the square one just to make sure we dont exceed alloted weight do u think thats accurate enough 
if i were you i d make sure i was just under 60 kg just to be safe 
sorry but when i check online all it says is contact you local qatar airways office due to my location i ca n t do this i have one extra bag at 23kg and am wondering if anyone knows what this will cost me if it is ridiculously high i ll just leave it here but if it s within reason 400qr i ll bring it so does anyone know the going rate or cost per bag thanks jd 
where are you traveling what is your location qatar airways has high rates as far as i know i think is good to use cargo services if you are willing to take this bag of 23 kg good luck 
has anybody taken 32 lcd tv to india if so is it allowed in qatar airways as check in baggage and how much duty paid in customs back home do we have to go through red channel 
i remember similar topics were discussed before on ql just go thru the seach option that might bring addtional help 
can anyone give me a ballpark figure for shipping a cat from canada to doha i m waiting to hear back from a couple of companies but i would like to hear some real life experiences from folks does the cost double for shipping more than one pet or is there a base rate that goes up a certain amount for multiple pets thanks in advance 
the rate is per crate size weight shipped ca n t speak to the actual price as mine was done several years ago would recommend klm as the carrier of choice if you are traveling with animals signature line you ca n t fix stupid 
dear friends can you please tell me how many kgs are allowed in qatar airways if you have any information from some of your friend who travelled recently in qa because i heared that from 40 kgs they reduced to 35 kgs kindly reply me 
7kg maximum 
does anybody have any idea 39 s on the cost of flying a dog back to canada just a round about figure i have a black lab i want to take to canada with me instaed of leaving in a kennel for three months what airlines and how i go about it 
well my itsy bitzy cat cost 3000 by the time we got it here so i would say a dog would be a lot more 
klm have told me my yorkshire terrier is able to travel in the cabin with me from the u k to doha has anyone done this 2 pet relocation companies have told me i cant and im unsure whether they are telling me this to avoid getting their fee or whether i have been misinformed by klm cost is not the issue the wellbeing of our wonderful pet is i really want the most stress free method of travel possible for her can anyone help 
dogs are dogs only 
this post does what it says on the tin any advice i m coming from the uk what kind of things should i be thinking about shipping what stuff should i leave behind and buy when i get out there thank you or should i start practising and say shukran now o 
if you have a use it or lose it kind of deal with your relocation allowance bring as much as you can you wo n t have to spend as much on setup when you get here bringing your favourite stuff will make it seem more like home here bringing a car is probably not a good idea

i 39 m moving to doha soon for five months initially though it 39 s possible i may settle long term i 39 d like some advice on any good gyms in doha i can 39 t seem to get any comprehensive information on the net i 39 d like a pool sauna gym and a climbing wall would be a big plus any ideas or recommendations how much would it cost thanks for any help you can give me 
there are a couple of pure gyms i know of sas gym and gold s gym this one you may not know of it unless you are american which cater for the gym freaks the latter gym i believe is spoofed in dodgeball w ben stiller and will farrell however there are a few that are health clubs which is what you are after in your description they are al dana club diplomatic club doha club but closing soon and clubs in major hotels intercon ramada ritz sheraton etc plus al sharq ritz carlton opening soon and some other hotels i think most are pretty full prices for singles range from 3000qr to 8000qr per year appr do not know of any with climbing walls can i ask do the numerous stadiums have gyms that can be used also somewhere like aspire can you use any of the facilities there plus many housing compunds have all these facilities the quality depends on the compund offcourse some are real nice such as mirage al fardan beverly hills tbah etc some not so 
what s the best gym in doha 
hi guys is there any gyms in doha with top quality like holmes place chain i m asking this because i ve been reading quite a few complaints about gym conditions and service level in doha tahnks 
since how long are you working out in gyms seriously speaking i think there is very less body builders in doha and if anyone want to develop their body any small gym is more than enough never love a person you can live with always love a person you can never live without 
what is the best gym and where is the location and how much it cost in one month 
gold gym c ring road around qr 450 per month will be less if you take a annual membership 
hi i will be arriving to doha next week where is there a good gym where i can use a treadmill for running is there usually a limit on running on the treadmill ie 30minutes maximum time is there a gym without these limits i look so much forward to going to doha thomas 
most of the clubs like al dana etc have threadmills usually if it is n t busy they do n t mind you staying on 
does anybody know an inexpensive gym or fitness centre where i can go for less that 300 riyals a month do they even exist i wan na get fit but the ones i have found are all way too expensive like 600 a month 
if you pay in advance for whole year in al massa gym it will cost you around qr 210 a month whole amount is qr 2500 for a year if you pay 6 month in advance it will cost you something like qr 250 a month qr 1500 got 6 months 3 month in advance qr 333 qr 1000 for 3 months also you can check qatar university i just recently heard something about their gym they say it s cheap but the guy who tried to tell me about it did n t speak english so i could n t inderstand what is this exactly about i am going to check it soon if you know something about it please also let me know make money and love no fighting no war 
sigh what a disappointment even the classes are separated so you got ta look our for female only spin or whatever also the male workout area is big and spacious and nice female workout area small and enclosed and limited i m losing my gym motivation any experiences with other gyms or other workout groups etc

hi everyone would greately appreciate your views i am currently working in india i got a offer from a local bank in qatar in december but now they say that they are not getting the work visa and work visas stopped for indians now they explore option of transferring an existing work visa issued to an indian which is not used whether this option will work if not how long the ban on indians will continue regards raaj 
i dont think there is a problem nowadays with visa most of the reputed companies banks oil companies get them easily but if u happen to know that there is a problem to this particular bank then its possible to get back that indian visa u are talkin about usually the government issues certain number of visas to establishments if they bring someone and finds that he is not good or he misbehaves with the officers then they have the right to kick him out of country in that case the company gets back that visa and can bring new staff from india 
i was hired directly from qatar and my company said they have applied for work visa can anyone tell how soon i can get work visa some people are frightening me that indians dont get work visa easily is police clearance certificate necessary for applying resident visa for an indian if so how to apply 
why its very hard to get an approval for female working visa here in qatar 
why cant you just give us the info here so everyone can benefit of your info p 
i am coming to qatar in visit visa coming week to search for a job i ve got no reference as such applied in many sites in qatar not even a single positive response finally i am hearing these 1 work visa not given for indians 2 oil price has come down anyone please tell me if these reasons are valid and true if so how to actually get a job in qatar your suggestions could help me and anybody who is dying to get a job in qatar

today children returned late from school dps mis the reason being a child was found dead in the school bus from what i heard the child dozed off in the bus during her morning trip the driver did not notice and the child was left in the bus they found her in the afternoon it should have been the heat in the bus that killed her she was just 4 years old did anyone hear about this 
what is dps mis 
any news why ql and other sites like google etc are intermitent today all other website are extremely slow except qtel website 
today all sites are slow what is wrong qtel u think they make major spy on all of us thinking everybody is right and everybody is wrong its depend where you stand 
from today 4 pm local time internet been dragging here is it just me or whole qatar as always qtel customer service sucks sh 20 mins no ones picked yet i hung up anyones been feelin the same seems 2mb line isnt that fast eh lol remember the last time it happened some under sea cables broke up hope its not all again abdallah 
i have the highest speed option however lately my net has been slow and is always disconnecting is anyone experiencing the same thing 
and i thought it was just me baldrick qatar s answer to google o 
the intenet is running slow like hell is any bodt experiencing any of this i have a 1mb internet connection it used to download at 120 kb s now it about 46kb s browsing is slow plus the internet gaming is slow from a looooong time ago personally i dont think 300 riyals a month is worth qtels s t 
this issue has been covered multiple times here on ql undersea net cables cut to the mid east and blaaaaahhh i just cant bring myself to type about it anymore 
qtel offers 512k 1mb and 2mb adsl for 200 300 or 400qr per month i am moving to a place where i will have to decide which subscription would like some advice from experienced people is the extra speed worth it is the speed difference noticeable i ask the question because the place where i am living now provides an internet connection via a cable and the speed of the connection varies a lot 
we have the 200 qr month and i find it very fast it does slow down from time to time but overall i m happy with it 
the router they provide is very weak for signal if i go to another room my internet disconnects is there another router i can purchase to use to the internet access with qtel adsl that has a stronger signal 
qtel s adsl is very capable of providing a good range throughout your house provided its kept in a proper location where the signal is not blocked by walls or any other objects that can interfere with the signal additionally its ideal to keep the router on a higher level like mounted on a wall or the upper floor of the villa perhaps 
slow at work slow at home started a couple weeks ago and getting progressively worse i think qtel is not upgrading their bandwidth fast enough to accommodate new dsl subscribers anyone else with mysteriously slowing dsl when can we expect the emiri decree for outside telecomm competition to come into effect and rid the world of the scourge that is qtel 
i agree we ve been experiencing problems for about a week now and it seems to be getting progressively worse glad we re not the only ones with this problem it makes trawling through worthless threads so much of a bore when you come to the end of your rope tie a knot and hang on 
q198 
yesssssssssssssssssss its slow 
i am just getting ready to move to doha this month and am wondering if qtel has vonage blocked as they seem to block everything that makes life easier if anyone could let me know asap so i can atleast return this box before i leave and not waste 80 cheers aaron 
sorry to bother you all with this post i just did a search and found like a hundred answers to my question thanx anyways 
what is the spoken language in doha is it urdu or arabic please let me know a website where i can learn the spoken language in doha 
we spreak arabic in qatar but english is also widely spoken plenty of urdu speakers too  love is the answer 
study shows no decline in qtel customer satisfaction a news item in todays gulf times on page 15 reports that according to a study conducted by an external company for qtel it was found that there was no decline in the customer satisfaction wondering who those satisfied customers are any one from ql

i know an off leash area where we could play fetch would be too much to ask would it but where do all you dog owners like to walk your dogs are there beaches nearby where we could toss her in the water to cool off thanks 
al wakrah beach appears to be popular further a field any quiet beach area 
where can i walk the dog in doha is it frowned upon to just walk down the street or is it prohibited obviously i would clean up behind him thanks 
does anyone know if one is allowed to walk a dog in public i would love to take my dog for a walk on the corniche in the morning i would of course leave him on the leash and not let him run loose are dogs allowed in parks 
so far as i know you are not allowed to take your dog for walks on the corniche nor are they allowed in any parks usually signature line you ca n t fix stupid 
can anyone please help i adopted a pup from qaws on friday after the big fire and took him down the corniche last night with my family for a lovely walk we could not see any signs not to walk the dog but somehow felt out of place doing it can someone please tell me if it is okay to walk dogs there as i do not want to offend anyone many thanks 
i do n t know about signs but i have seen a couple of people walking their dogs there just remember not to leave any doo doo behind 
hi all my first post have been reading for a while my husband and i are coming to qatar as he has been offered a job and we are brining our dog with us he is a large breed and special restirctions are needed for us to bring him in i wanted to check with others who have come from the uk how your pet has adapted to life in qatar are there areas they can run free are villas ok for them thanks in advance 
they will accommodate that s no problem i have a dog as well but you will not be able to let him run free in parks cause it s not allowed but if you will go somewhere far to a beach outside doha it wont be a problem and you can take him with you along the sea side but not free they don t have the same mentality like us and some of them are not allowed to touch them because of their religion but it s ok they will just ignore you nobody will bother you as long as you keep it close to you in the end of the day is better for the dog to be with you cause he is part of the family already so even if will be different for him here at least he will be with you cheers 
hi i would really love to get a small puppy dog for my kids but i am worried about the kind of lifestyle we would have like are we allowed to bring dogs to the mall or are there very restricted areas for dogs i would want to bring my small dog to places if possible any advice would be appreciated 
dogs are not allowed in most public places that is why if you want a dog a garden should be a must and an area to walk it around your house aisha taweela 
where in doha can i find a pet shop how many pet shops are there any specific one that you 39 d recommend thanks in advance 
see other threads regarding petshops my only experience was in one about 7 years ago in doha and i have never set foot in one again if you look at some recent threads you will find many people have had shocking experiences in some local petshops that sell live animals if its petfood or supplies you are after try rider trading carrefour landmark etc most supermarkets stock pet food and some basic supplies rider tends to stock food and even more supplies and will often get particulars in if you have something in mind if its a pet you are after see threads of dogs cats being given away or scan through this board looking for posts relating to qatar animal welfare society qaws 
i just saw a german shepard running around in mattar kadeem has anyone reported losing their pet 
we should wait for few hours more 
we are looking at moving to qatar we have a cockapoo who needs regular clipping is it easy to find dog groomers are dogs allowed on the beaches and are there many places to walk dogs in doha thanks anxious dog owner 
there are 2 vets that offer the service doha vets and qatar vet centre dog walking places are minimil if you are going to be staying in a compound you would be able to walk around there cornish is another option but you get hassled by locals who will tell you that its not allowed but there are no signs so i generally ignore them and tell them that my dogs are not bothering them and until there are signs i will keep walking my dogs there the best place is from the emiri diwan side towards the new islamic museum never in the direction of sheraton as there are many more people there are a few beaches but on weekends too many crowds walking through the streets you will be hassled by people driving by barking at you or asking how much you will sell your dog for or generally just harrassing if you are a woman hope this helps if you do n t like the heat get out of the kitchen but stop trying to fan the flames before you leave it will burn you on the a as you go t 
my neighbors leave their dog tied up outside all day and it s apparently schizophrenic cuz it stares into the woods and barks at leaves it would n t be so bad if it occasionally shut up but i clocked it one day 5 5 hours straight i m losing my mind listening to this retarded beast i get off work and i d like to relax but no i get to hear barking for 5 hours i need a clandestine way to make the dog stop barking suggestions
