U1255	Withnail	2007-03-05 18:41:56	Q212_R18_C9	well i date a saudi so i have to say he and his friend treat me very respectfully . yes lot 's of them do go to bahrain on the weekend ; but so do a lot of qataris and kuwatis . the place be basically crawl with people from the more conservative nation on the weekend . besides the fact that the number of land cruiser increase and there be more people in the pub i have n't notice a difference . as for dress ; i can dress less conservatively in bahrain than here . there be more single woman as well so i do n't feel like i stand out so much . bahrani girl do n't wear the abaya as much a here and i have n't see to many in hijab . i doubt she 'll notice many stare at all . as for it become more conservative ; well they be close down all the bar in the 3 star hotel because that 's where all the prosititutes hang out . but my guess be you wo n't even notice they be go .
