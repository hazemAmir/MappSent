advice and help best bank hi guys  i need to open a new bank accoount  which be the best bank in qatar  i assume all of them will roughly be the same  but stll which have a slight edge  money transfer  benifits etc  thanks    
commercial bank ibq 
the best bank in qatar for you would be the one that fit in your requirements i suggest you visit the major bank here  and approach the customer relations person there to guide you with the facility the bank offer  they include  current accounts facility savings account facility  money transfer  however  i highly recommend use the bank transfer only in emergency case  there be money transfer agent which offer good exchange rate  and low service fee   tie ups with any bank in your home country to ease transfer 
 credit  debit card facility  customer care service  promotional service  bank loans facility  etc  i recommend that you visit the near bank and gather all info it ll just take you a couple of day to arrive at the decision  
commercial bank 
any bank other than doha bank

ibq  if your salary be 25k above you will have a banking officer that will take care of your need  
west bank     
qatar islamic bank 
if your salary be qr35k or more you can opt for qnb with their qnb first facility which allow you to use the airport lounge around the world  a faciltiy which come in handy when travel economy class  also use their master card  credit card  get you mile with qatar airways which you can use for travel  and there service in last 5 year of my be a customer have be excellent   p s  i dont work for or with qnb   
what about for salary less than 5k  
happygolucky     was a very good marketing  qnb would be happy read your comment  p 
sulieman i hope so and then may be i can get even well service    
doha bank        without any doubt

qnb is best 
advice and help which bank to use in qatar  hi does anyone have recommendation for which bank to use in qatar  the account will be use to get my salary pay into and transfer fund overseas  thanks 
i use to use cbq when i first get here  but i be n t happy with the service and product  now i use qnb and it fairly ok  but when it come to send money back home  cbq still offer good exchange rate  
doha bank ltd be mostly prefer by the salary class  
no worry bank  qnb  be with the royals                   
cbq be the good option 
most of the bank here provide good service to the salaried class and i hardly see much difference among them  you should select a bank where your company have a bank account a it will allow your salary get credit to your account very quickly each month  
agree with acchabaccha  go with the same bank a your company  unless you plan to take out a loan in the near future  then go with the bank that you re most likely to get the best loan offer from  
cbq  
thanks for the feedback guy  will find out which bank my company bank with and go with that 
good luck  caramel  super input by acchabaccha  acchabaccha mean lovely baby   
lol  thanks

best international hsbc best local commerical bank these be my point of view 
posb  post office saving bank ibsb  international blood sucking bank hsbc  high society bullshitting corporation 
lol    
 this topic have be widely cover in many previous thread  use the search engin to find several forum topic that treat this subject  the bottom line be  there be no such thing a   best bank    the concept of customer service and satisfaction be unknown  they be all sub standard  procedure and response time  light years away from western bank  choose from the name mention above  the most convenient for you to use   
the one and only best bank be qnb  in my 14 year of experience 
any idea about cbq   img nid 22259 title desc link none align right width 135 height 180  
avail the low interest rate for car loan  
well i think it s a rip off  no such thing a the best bank  i leave doha bank because of poor customer service and go to qnb which be happy with  with qnb  you have to have a minimum of qr 3  000 in your current account always  it s a compulsory saving scheme  plus  you get 25  in your saving account and if you take out a mortgage loan you pay 8 5   be careful  read the small print  i do n t trust bank here

i recommend qnb credit card  you earn qmiles whenever you use it and so you can redeem award in qatarairways privilege club  you can also use the airport lounge  
i ve hear good review of doha bank cc  i have a platinium cc from cbq  i use to earn mile with qa but they stop the same from last year  they still charge me qar 500  customer service tell me to enrol in some wafa point but both the website and contact number of wafa do not work if i wish to enrol  awesome  qar 500 buck for a useless silver card  sorry platinium  
moving to qatar best bank  hi ti all ql s  what bank you be use  and why  are you use this bank just because it have an affiliate at home  regards  
bank be use u  talk to those who have take a credit card or loan to know more  
in qatar that be like say which be the best std  
i m surprised to see such feedback on qatar bank  is there any serious problem with bank here  please share if any one have a bad experience before  i m use commercial bank and till now i m ok with their service  
well arman  nothing be wrong here with bank  i feel they be not up to par with uae bank in term of service at least not with the best which be abu dhabi islamic bank  but i have make an extensive review of qib  ibq  qnb and cbq  i find out that qnb and cbq be very dynamic  give you a lot for cheap  my need be  free current account with no minimum balance with 2 debit card good credit card with airport lounge and add benefit 0  payment plan at good retaillers excellent mobile and internet banking cheap atm and transfer for abroad  for the above  qnb and cbq be the best  but it really depend on your salary too  ibq be not very good  qib be ridiculous  
with qnb for last 4 year plus  no issue  great service with a smile  mostly  from qatari s  yeah dont be surprise  and now since they start qnb first it just get even good    
westernindoha  that s the information that i be look for and it answer my question  cheers  
moltenmetal  it depend how you be look on the subject matter and the point of view  a the if the glass half empty or half full    there be fee for the service  i wish that we do n t need bank and you remind me of old day where we put the gold and the money in bag and bury them in the ground   good luck  
that s new way of description for the bank s  i be plan to do the same  let the company deposit the salary in the bank account and i will ignore it for some time   cheers  
i do n t know if it be the high competition  or no competition   is there any review issue by central bank  or any magazine   is there any benchmark base on customer feedback   when i search ql there be so many disappointed and negative feedback from from bank client i do n t see the reason behind it   regards  
sheabi  the reason behind it  be that most people in ql have very low income  hence everytime a bank will take them a penny even a very justified one for a rendered service they will call them robber  also bank may not have the same level of service if you earn 2000 or 25000  i would advise you to find a the right branch and the right customer service agent  and stick to him to build a relationship  because like everywhere you get some lazy people and you want to avoid them  
advice and help islamic banks in qatar any idea about good islamic bank in qatar  services  product wise  recommendation  experience is there any islamic service  commercial bank

although they do n t have the satisfactory customer service level  i will still recommend them a it s pure islamic services  i  personally  do n t accept the idea of islamic service from a commercial bank  
customer service at safa be rather good  it be particularly suit to ppl who receive their salary at qcb but want to save the islamic way  easy cash tranfer  
my dad be in bank all his life and think it just an eyewash    its just the same commercial banking label islamic  he think we be all fool to follow it so blindly  any comment

moving to qatar personal loan and work termination i be currently work here in qatar  our employer inform u that they will transfer to contractor with less salary  but we have option not to accept  but the problem be i have personal loan in one of the bank here in doha  what if i will not accept the offer  what will happen to me  i mean do the bank will force to pay or not  
haha  so you want to get away without pay the loan  
not really  but iam just curious what if the company be the cause of termination  
yes  but your loan and contract be with the bank  
you mean even the cause of termination be the company  the bank will force me to pay   and wat if i find new job with less salary war will happen do they reduce my monthly fee  
i be sure you can renegotiate the repayment with the bank  
ah okay  because i be just worry  but not pay and run from my debt be not my option  i do believe in karma  thanks for the info  
you re welcome  i hope it all work out for you  
fact  if your company terminate you  take that letter to your bank  you wo n t be require to pay any remain amount  bank will use it tact  do n t yield  after few day of delay  finally you will get clearance from bank and fly home  insurer of your money  bank would pay that amount to bank  may be insurer and bank be have office in the same building  or manager be cousin  they be after your money  so escape clear from both party  pray hard  good luck in find another job soon somewhere  regards  
would you believe if i say 1000 have leave without repay a single coin in case your company terminate you  what for you pay premium every month my friend  
this be interesting  i do not know this  to be honest  i be surprised that this be possible  but good for those who have bank loan

anyplace far off from a school would be ideal to avoid traffic block esp in the morning

welcome to qatar where be the best place in qatar to just sit down  relax  and read a book  a cup of coffee and a nice view be a plus as well   
corniche near sheraton hotel  but weather be not good  and also westbay area be also good  
well i guess well to stay in your house  lay down on your bed to read book or relax because the kind of weather that we be have now in qatar i dont think so that you can stay outside even in the park just to read a book  
at pearl 
the only place where it be reasonable nice to do so be the pearl or the aspire park  but have no aspire no coffee shop or any of the nice hotels on the lounge terrace or by the pool but coffee will cost you 5x more  so you need to drink slowly    
in corniche at near pearl  but not now around 11 30am  contact hmc emergency to arrange an ambulance to pick you up at 12 00  lol 
go to al bida park around 1630 take a cup of coffee  not good one a no other option there  from the one of those stall select a tree face roa  sea or other side sit and relax have your coffe read book for some time and must leave before 1800 a humidity will push you out of that place  in this season  
inside coffee beanery  opposite ramada  between 1200  1600 on fridays  get out after 1600  cos that s when the crowd come  
home sweet home in ths hot weather 
i too prefer my sweet home for chillaxing there be no good place than one s home to relax and enjoy  
thank you so much  at this weather yes  i think it hard to go out  i think i would opt to go inside a coffee shop

the water be turbid  any reef there  thanks wongqatar 
but i do n t know the exact location  that s why i ask  
be snorkel at dukhan off the beach and in zekreet off the kayak be ok at both place  i think fuwairit would be nice  also the national park off the north coast would be good to check out sometime 
hi guys  nice to have the location for snorkel  is anyone able to be more precise and give exact location  i know the time be close to be over this year due to gelly fish  anyway  please advice the best location to snorkel  thanks in advance for your answer 
i go snorkelling two day ago off the coast of dukhan  about 2 km to the right of the water sports club  near to the desalination plant  some massive rock and colourless coral but there be quite a few different type of fish there  include some huge angel fish  very very nice spot  and yes  the jelly fish be here now    
 best place be fuwarait beach  swim striaght out and there be lot of coral  different fish  sea greass bed and sea snake  if your really lucky turtle  anywhere north of ras laffan should be good  i be at umm tais natural reserves  mention in post above  turn right at al shammal and head east  first island be ras rakkan and be hard to get to  go past until a hamlet and past this you can access umm tais  a few week ago  interesting place but fuwarait be easy to get to etc    sandy   beach we use to go to  al dhakriah mangrove  there be generally less to see on west coast than the east coast unless you go to place near construction which for the east coast be now a lot   hence i recommend french beach  fuwarait  there be also a few nice location you can snorkell in the inland sea  although current at certain time be very very strong  go past coastguard station at mouth and head along towards saudi until you see obvious shallow   
from what you all have say  fuwarait beach be a perfect place to explore  to enjoy and witness it natural reserve  thanks for the share  i m really wait and seek for answer of where to go and spend for our weekend vacation and adventure  hawaii snorkeling tour

the water be turbid  any reef there  thanks wongqatar 
but i do n t know the exact location  that s why i ask  
be snorkel at dukhan off the beach and in zekreet off the kayak be ok at both place  i think fuwairit would be nice  also the national park off the north coast would be good to check out sometime 
hi guys  nice to have the location for snorkel  is anyone able to be more precise and give exact location  i know the time be close to be over this year due to gelly fish  anyway  please advice the best location to snorkel  thanks in advance for your answer 
i go snorkelling two day ago off the coast of dukhan  about 2 km to the right of the water sports club  near to the desalination plant  some massive rock and colourless coral but there be quite a few different type of fish there  include some huge angel fish  very very nice spot  and yes  the jelly fish be here now    
 best place be fuwarait beach  swim striaght out and there be lot of coral  different fish  sea greass bed and sea snake  if your really lucky turtle  anywhere north of ras laffan should be good  i be at umm tais natural reserves  mention in post above  turn right at al shammal and head east  first island be ras rakkan and be hard to get to  go past until a hamlet and past this you can access umm tais  a few week ago  interesting place but fuwarait be easy to get to etc    sandy   beach we use to go to  al dhakriah mangrove  there be generally less to see on west coast than the east coast unless you go to place near construction which for the east coast be now a lot   hence i recommend french beach  fuwarait  there be also a few nice location you can snorkell in the inland sea  although current at certain time be very very strong  go past coastguard station at mouth and head along towards saudi until you see obvious shallow   
from what you all have say  fuwarait beach be a perfect place to explore  to enjoy and witness it natural reserve  thanks for the share  i m really wait and seek for answer of where to go and spend for our weekend vacation and adventure  hawaii snorkeling tour

wow  complete detail from geechee  u must put a consultancy firm thanks 
room for 4  000 not flat small flat start at 6  000 
i think it will depend on what kind of lifestyle you want here  what nationality be you  if you be western i would say you wont save much out of 20k  you would want a decent apartment  villa  good social life  weekend away  if you be the sort of person who be just come here to work work work  then you will be able to save more  it will be trial and error until you find the balance that suit you and the lifestyle you want to have  
hi notiva  u do get unfurnished one bedroom flat for qr 4  000 ideal for small family  
hi drmedo  please check this we can get accomodation even less qr 4000

i see a lot of people have already write a reasonable answer  but keep in mind following   about flat or car rental  depends who negotiate  if a european person or a westerner in general  forget it to find those rate  for them everything be double   a many have mention  depend on lifestyle  for example one of the most difficult issue for woman here  to find a normal hairdresser  beautician  etc  usually too expensive and very low quality  level of hygiene  if you go to a normal place  price be ridiculous for what you get  
salary and allowances how much disposable income do i need   i have be offer a teach post in doha  an apartment will be provide along with medical cover and a few other benefit such a travel to work each day  i have be offer 8500 qar per month  which be around 1400 per month  this be a huge pay cut for me  after my uk expense i m left with just over 200 of 1500 qar per month  will this be enough to live on  
no  why  oh  why would you want to take a pay cut to come here    this be not a kind place to those who be struggle financially  let me just say that after skimp on food  you wo n t be able to go anywhere  no car  and you will have no money with which to do anything  great life  huh  mandi 
thanks  be 8500 qar pm not a good salary then  i be meet with the school principle and company director next week  i m go to try and increase my salary then  ideally i m look for 1200 qar a that more closely compare to my after tax salary here in the uk  
hello dear  i be not sure what to tell you but each one of u be look for something different and also in a different situation  the short answer be no unless you be here to join a family member or plan on stay here for few month till something else open up  qatar be relatively expensive compare to many close by destination but it could be decent and moderate for those who know how to save  wish u best of luck  
 the rule of thumb for expat salary be your salary in the us uk plus 25  plus housing  transportation  medical  air ticket  etc  please realize there be n t public transportation per se in qatar  the qatar government wo n t even let anyone bring a spouse unless their base salary be over 10  000  i d say that s the line for   middle class    but again  why would you even be tempt  they be offer you peanut and that s a real sign of how they will treat you later  mandi  
oh  and you must know about need exit permit and that you can not change job   you probably ca n t even get a loan with that salary  not that you would want one   these school will not give you an noc  period  mandi 
and if you ask what be an noc  you be n t ready to talk to the school about salary  either  mandi 
8500 qr a month  why would you accept that  i hope you be not a maths teacher or economics  maybe you teach religious education and be crazy  in that case you should accept

qatar living lounge has anyone live in cairo a an expat  i ll be off to cairo in the next three or four week  since my husband have be transfer there for two year  did you love live in cairo  or hat it  why  how do it compare to qatar  tell me about it   desperately try to find a cairoliving website   
the one thing you can be certain of be that cairo be not doha    we be talk about a city of over 12million where the traffic be so bad  if you think doha be bad  just wait  it actually comical  there be also no system and it be one of the most frustrating place to live in  hope you be base in zamalek or maadi which be the nice part  but the lack of a system and the pushiness  of the egyptian will make you angry and frustrated the poverty be also strike  and yet  and yet  in one street of cairo you will find more charm  more magic and more life than the whole of doha  it be a crazy place but a place which love music and a place which be confident of itself  not surprising give it ancient history   it have the soul which doha so lack and because of that you put up with the traffic and frustration  egypt be a beguiling country which capture the heart of more than one roman emperor and many king  keep that in mind a you deal with the settling in period and once you   
celestville wher r u from     i m egyptian 
i be from egypt and i really miss it so much here evry thing be samiliar or good that doha yes more crawded but nice ppl not like qatari and they respect the expat  when they see that u expat  so you will have advantage than the eqyptian and they will help you  even without your asking  but here the qatari ppl qo 1st in evry thing except the work  and when they saw expat so he be thier slave who come to collect thier money really you be lucky i want to find good job in cairo so i can go back to my home 
oh cairo    i never see one who visit cairo and do n t love it execluding the traffic cairo be perfect 
well they  who be they exactly     say cairo be umm al dunya  i be egyptian 
work in cairo and leave after 10 month a he do n t like it  he have live in the gulf from age 8 so he know roughly what to expect  it must have be bad a he be on 100  000 plus housing  school fee  
cairo be not easy to like and life be certainly not as comfortable a the gulf  but one can not doubt it charm and the fact that it be right at the heart of the arab world  there be a depth in egypt which can produce nobel prize winner  which you simply dont find in the gulf but it be not an easy place to live  admiteddly

for your response  celestvile  sound like all the expat community live in maadi  and whilst i have hear that it be a quiet area with lot of greenery  i doubt it s convinient for u to live there a it be quite a ride from giza  where my husband work  we shall see  we hear 6 october area be also nice  besides  our housing allowance will only be  1500  which i think do n t strech for a place in maadi  and after living in a small flat for the last three year  i m look forward to a big place with a garden  by the way  do you have any idea where the french school be locate  dweller  oh god  now you worry me  with that kind of money i could live anywhere  wonder why your son do n t like it  pm  yes i notice that too  the  sign   sound like i will get rip off quite often  then  so your friend dislike live in cairo  
moving to qatar would you hire an interior designer  hi everyone  i just want to do a survey and see how many of you  people already in doha and people come to doha  would hire the service of a professional interior designer to design your home rather than do the thinking  design  shopping  deal with contractor yourself  and would you want something creative  a designer home or just home furnishing  
i think that my post be invisible to others  i dont seem to get any reply on my post although all the rest post by everyone else seem to get a whole lot of attention waves  anyone  i really be curious to know and be offer my service here               interior designer for hire 
depends on what on offer           can we fix it  yes we can  
there be many interior designer over here that do the stuff you be talk about  many home owner do consult them rather than the construction contractor for the same  
ukengqatar i do n t get your question  stealth  yes that s my point  construction contractor might have the know how and have the contact to do the job but they be n t designer  let alone the fact that you might be pay twice as much for everything               interior designer for hire 
 designer could do a good job  or an excellent job  personally i would n t use one for my residential unit  may be for a commercial unit i might use an designer  due to the cost of use one  now i be talk about the   interior designers     
no  i trust myself   bottom line try not to worry so much and buy what u lvoe      
well jack  what if use one be n t that expensive                interior designer for hire 
mallrat  trust yourself could mean that you have get a good taste and a good way of combine different element and furniture and make it work for you and that s great  but what if say you want the bark of a tree to hang down from your ceiling and have recess lighting in it or something  i should write that down i like the idea myself                interior designer for hire 
if it s cheap to hire one plus the designer do n t require expensive thing  it s perfectly fine  but personally  i d rather design my own place  only busy and rich people require interior designer  aside from the big company  
that be some what true  but if a designer ca n t adjust him herself to work with different budget  big and small  then they be n t that good               interior designer for hire 
welcome to qatar 12  000qr a good salary  is 12  000qr a good salary for a single person to live on in doha  the company will provide housing but no transportation allowance  is this a good deal  thanks

i agree with siddh that life be kind of boring in qatar 
 please inform the united states internal revenue service that there be no need to worry about tax here  someone keep forget to inform them so they keep collect tax from us citizen expat work all over the world  check the us tax code and tell me where it say no tax to be pay if you work in qatar  or any other foreign country   i ve hear this bunch of misinformation bs way too many time  if you do n t actually know then you probably should n t advise on such issue      a wise man know what he do not know     
depends completely upon ur lifestyle  if u hav a control over ur out of the way lifestyle  u can certainly have a ball of time with that much salary out here in qatar since ur housing be already take care  within time  u can also get ur drive linc   purchase a car  it wudnt b more than 1500  per month if u take up a vehicle loan  
its really good and handsome amout  and the company you be work be the best company of qatar a i tell you before right   so congrates   cheers    
moving to qatar commute time doha airport hi all  husband and i will be move to doha in january  we re look at lusail pearl area  but he will be work at the doha airport  any idea on what the commute time be in the mornings afternoons  thanks so much  kiki 
morning  6 30 7 00am   it take almost 40 45 minute  afternoon  if there be no traffic  30 minute                            i do n t want a signature line to prove that i m great   
thanks  how awesome  i be think it be more like 1 5 hour from what everyone have say about doha traffic     being here in the usa be a bit difficult to find out what area be best to live in doha  my husband and i love be at home  we prefer high rise with a nice gym though give we be bring motorcycle over i be think somthingh be a garage might be best  we have no kid so school and have other kid around u be not a top priority  given this  which areas buildings would you guy recommend  we do n t want to commute more than say 30 40 minute each way if we can help it  to and from new doha airport   what information be there out there about the pearl  i imagine be still be mostly a huge construction site but be there finish buildigns there worth commute to and from  are shop area and restaurant nearby already finish  thanks so much  kiki 
wow  in lusail pearl area    hmmm that s too expensive to live on there  hehhe  there s a lot of villa s here which you can stay peacefully  i ve forget the name of it  so  you re from florida   because your name be kikifl  kiki your name then fl be your place  be i right   hehehe  then   you like photography also  professional   hehehe  that s cool  there s a lot of nice place here to be take a shot in your cam  
 qatar s property development website be mislead a most of qatar itself  what you see be not what you ll get  lusail be a   plan new city   due to open soon but you go there now  all you ll se be an empty desert land with maybe 2 tower crane  pearl be nearly complete but with a lot of infrastructure and other nature problem  both location be at the north outskirt limit of the city  while the new airport be be build at the southern outskirt limit of the city  you do have to across the whole city and the traffic here be another nightmare  not only the traffic jam but also the aggressive and risk drive local style   if no traffic  it will be a 20 30 minute drive  the best location for you would be near by the marriott hotel  a friendly advice  be prepare for the big frustration you ever experience at professional and social level and you wo n t be disappoint  i wish you all the best   
then you go around the place and select for your self  there be plenty of accomodations available with few people to occupy it  depend on your budget  real estate be come down  taste differs from person to person  good luck 
 yes i m from florida and yes photography pay some  of our bill   husband get contract to work in doha so i be think the expensive part of live arrangement there will all depend on what his contract stipulates  thanks for the real estate agent contact mdobrasz  will see if we can start line up some visit to different area and take a look at villa v condo  not sure what be best for u yet  i think give we be go to try to bring our 2 motorcycle a house with a garage will be best  nic  thanks for the advice  i think we ll probably opt to be closet to airport than to drive 1 hour to get to and from work  so far i have see very little   real   picture of doha  mostly plan and projection image of what it will  look like so we figure we re in for huge construction site in the desert    
if you be in doha for a long term contract  it may be cheap just to buy new bike than have them ship  pay gcc taxes  registration etc  etc   just a thought   
dohadiesel  do you know where i can go to find out how much tax be and what need to be do to clear the bike through custom once we ship them  they be custom chopper  doubt i will find anything like it there  grant  give what i d hear about drive in doha i m not sure we ll even ue them there  after a first visit we ll decide    thanks for the info  
hi  i be not actually in doha yet myself  arrive at the end of this month  the only vehcile import i have do in doha previously be for the oilfield market  and be do slightly differently  you might be surprise  i see a couple of big bike shop here in doha when i visted a few week back  anyhow  in dubai a few year ago  i import some chopper from the guy off discovery channel program  the duty be 5  of the cif value   eg  bike be us  20000 cif then duty will be us  1000  i then have to pay a local agent commission on the import of us  1500 each a they hold the import licence agreement for the bike  therafter  police inspection  registration and other detail be approx   1200 per bike  then of course you will have standard insurance and road tax  which i believe be approx   100 per month in doha   someone can correct me if i be wrong  pm me if you need further information  i do work in this field and can get a colleague to check all the in and out if require  have   
my husband be a life long motorcycle junkie  got his first when he be about 10 year old  he would never consider rid one here in doha  traffic be very dangerous  they have the high accident rate per caput in the entire world  check out some you tube video show all the spectacular car crash in doha  you have to see it to believe it  seriously most people see a car crash every single day  riding motorcycle on the street in doha be only for fool in my opinion  
welcome to qatar work and life in qatar i m from the philippine  they offer me in qatar 3000 qr plus free accomodation and transportation to work  i want to know if that salary be suitable in doha  qatar  is the cost of living in doha  qatar high than other country like saudi etc  how much can i spend for food  please estimate  anyway i m single  i also want to know if it be okay to go out of qatar with your friend both guy and girl  
it s not enough my dear  
it depend how u wan na live  some people live with 1500 salary  but if u will go to face shop  disco bar everyday sure not enough money but just for food i guess so 1000 riyal more than enough 
depends on the job 
salary offer depend on ur experience and jod description  
i guess it s not enough  you may bargain a little bit more  if you fail  it up to you to decide  there s no harm in try anyway  once you decide to quit  please be remind that you can not comeback within 2 year  
for a skilled worker from philippine  the normal basic salary be range from qr 2  500 to 5  000 exclude housing and transpo allowance  for professional  salary be range from qr 8  000 to 45  000 depend on the qualification and industry  i know some colleague in oil  gas  banking industry and investment be even receive between qr 50k to 80k per month  so it all depend on your qualification and work experience  good luck  
frankly speak the salary offer to you be a meager one if doha standard of living be concern  for your food alone you have to shell out at least 800 riyal per month  your personal need be an additional cost of 200 riyal  so total you ll have a net salary of 2000 riyal or about 500 dlrs  socializing be another strain in your pocket  but it s okay as long a you follow the good manner and right conduct of be a foreigner here  no public display of affection and you must dress up modestly  if you think 2000 riyal be enough saving for you then good luck and welcome to doha  
 it depend upon your lifestyle actually life here be much simpler compare in phils the cost of the commodity be relatively cheap and you can afford  almost  anything if you have vice like smoking and drinking  then you have to consider to include in your budget with regard to go out with friend from both gender  they re be no problem with that unless you do thing which be   haram   and unacceptable here also pda or no display of affection like kiss and hug in public as an added bonus  qatar have be rank the second most peaceful country in the middle east  just behind oman and the 33rd most peaceful country in the world  so welcome here  kabayan   
3k offer be not good enough you will just remorse it after know that your peer be have twice than your offer and your stuck with your job alexam be correct well haggle your employer to increase the offer or find another suitable offer super taas ng bilihin dito  qatari people in general be good and humane  majority educated qatar be an open city be well balance as long a you follow the norms it be a great city with great people  not much not less the only problem be the weather yun lang po  
tingin ko ok na un kasi sa akin ang offer ay 5k sapat siya kasi di natin kayang kitain sa pilipinas un 
qp offer i have an interview with department head and lead people  not hr  at qp for the grade 13 post  and they say they will inform me the next procedure like medical chekups etc  does anybody have the idea how much it will take to complete the procedure and when can i get the offer letter  and please do let me know what will be the approximate salary and other allowance  if anybody have any idea  please share with me  please   
salary and allowances qp offer negotiation hi all  i ve finally receive the official offer from qp and i think i m be lowball  the offer be qr23  000  14  200 housing and school and benefit  they put me in grade 16  i do n t know anything about these grade  can anyone enlight me and tell me also how much i can negotiate  i read some mixed discussion about the leeway i have for negotiation  i be expect qr35  000 basic  realistic   thx in advance 
35  000 be out of reach for grade 16  however  there be always a room for negotiation provide that you afford risk the job a they be n t normally that keen have a particular applicant for the job  they do n t even care if it take them more couple of month to fill the vacancy  
open their website and you can apply online  try to negotiate more buddy  
realisticly you be make  6  300 per month  with pay accommodation and free child s education etc etc  i do n t see how you be be low ball when the majority of your basic income be go to be saving because your overhead be be pay for by qp already  even if your current job position you be make more then  6300  the chance of save anything be highly unlikely  also remember their be promotion  yearly appraisal and the big fat bonus s every year  if you do the annual gross income on your basic salary with the above you could be pull easily 28  000 30  000 per month   do n t miss this opportunity   most ppl on ql dream to have a offer like this   good luck  
how much be you get at your previous job  have you mention that in your cv   
normally qp do not negotiate package  it be either you take it or leave it  they have hundred of applicant look to join qp  that salary be a low end of grade 16  normally there be no promotion in qp unless you be a qatari or someone within gcc and you do get bonus depend on your rating  your annual bonus for an everage rating on your salary be around 34000 qar and after 4 year you get 6000 qar furniture maintenance annually  on top of the salary they will give you an expatriate allowance of about 3000 per month depend on which european country you come from and a car allowance of qar 2000 00 per month  so basically it not bad  
after take all that you may start cost control  on your subordinate   
take care of your single big expense i m not a qp employee so could be wrong  but dont they take care of tuition for upto 4 kid  us uk school here will cost you north of qar 40k annually  and that be for pre k     as to whether they be low balling you  maybe  but without know detail of your qualification  current pay etc it hard to tell take into consideration the point i ve make about school expense and those make by others on this thread  that say  i will say there be always room for a counter offer just be smart with the number you go backto them with also depend on how much of a hard ass the person you be deal with be and at this point  i would imagine you have some idea  
if you re go to be the office tea boy  it s magnificent  if you be a professional  engineer  with year of experience and a senior management position  it s garbage  one note  school fee and housing  depend on where and how you wish to live  can be very expensive  do some research on school fee and look at ad for the type of housing you would find satisfactory  your question can be answer  if you provide more detail on your education experience and what job you be be offer  
school fee and housing be pay for by the company  i m in corporate fin with over 10 year experience in north america  we be make here more than what be offer  that s why we be think to counter offer a i m gon na be the only one work there  can anyone who know qp policy tell me what amount to ask for to get a good trade off  and if i can ask for grade jump from 16 to 17  as reminder i be offer 23k basic  thx 
if you be make more in na then stay put  also their offer might increase by 2000 or so but wo n t be significantly different  as to the grade increase  this be not very likely a they can not have someone do the same job on a different grade  creates a lot of problem for them 
salary and allowances qp offer hi folks i be offer a package from qp for a grade 14 job  basic 15  000 to 17000  housing 14  000  furniture allowance 55  000  transport 2  000  medical coverage  free education for child  i have master degree and 13 year of work experience with 4 and 1 2 year in oil  gas company  be this grad be justified accord to my experience  should i accept this be offer  could you please advise me on this  
yes take it  
sounds good to me  too  mandi 
much acceptable and i have negotiate in hte past with qp and i know  this be best

things be pretty slow at qp  however  have you receive the offer  if yes  the visa process may take up to 6 month  this be normal with not only qp but all semi government companies corporations here in qatar  
everything s slow in here  my first day of work in a govt hospital be 6 month after my actual interview  this long for just hr paperwork  no visa processing at that matter since i be under father s sponsorship yet  
thank you very much but i be already in qatar work  although i be less than six month with my employer but my company  sponsor  be ready to give noc  hope there wont be problem with that  
wow  good for u pasomarch atleast your company be wiiling to issue an noc  
thanks  gildine23 
salary and allowances offer by qp hi  i be look at an offer from qp  salary be 45  000qr per month and 10  000qr per month for accommodation plus also car allowance  etc  can u tell me if this be enough to have a very high standard of living and if 10  000 per month be enough for a quality house  maybe with a pool    there be just my wife and myself  also  any comment on qp  thanks very much 
45000 qr      what be the position you be come for  
10 000 be not enuff for good house  3 bedroom stand alone villa decent building will cost you min 15 000 qr  what ban be you in    45 000 qr  wow   
house with a pool for 10000qr in doha  yeah right  more likely a serviced one bedroom flat with a condominial pool  good enough  
thanks for the input guy  i do not know what the band be  sounds like the income be good a there be a bonus on top of the 45k per month  but also sound like i need more money for the house  also they offer 9 week annual leave  is this standard and would it include public holiday  
 45  000 per month should easily afford you a very lavish lifestyle i would think  10  000 a month for housing probably wo n t get you the pool that you desire  housing be insanely expensive in this country  if you must then i would put a bit of your own salary into secure the type of residence you really want  like novita77 say i would think 15000qr would get you a very nice place  you would still have plenty of cash leave over to   live it up   esp if they be also give you a car allowance like you state in your post  qp be a well respect company that hire many foreigner  as every job i highly recommend you get everything in writing and sign by both party   
thanks everyone 
make the expected villa rent qr  20k  that will get u a villa with a common pool in a compound  for a villa with it own pool    i do n t know   
 when sign with q companies  they will refer in your contract to item that be   per policy    be careful of those item because they can change   policy   at whim   
20k will not even get you a nice villa with it own swiming pool  for 20k u can rent a in a good compound  25k will get u the villa u want with it own swiming pool i always tell the truth  even when i lie 
you may be on a special contract although the housing tell me otherwise  the bonus be a new one on me if you be on an indefinite contract unless it s the western inducement allowance  wia   i think you will find the 45 day be inclusive of public holiday which be standard for senior staff  
visas and permits gon na join qp dear friend  first of all  i  would like to thank you all for your amazing help and support  actually i get an offer from qp and it be good  they have request to undergo a full medical examination and i do that and send them the report through courier  i just wan na know  what   39  s the next step in the recruitment procedure and how long time it take from then to issue me  work visa  i will appreciate if any can help me  regards  
qp should be able to get it do for u in 2 week  
next step  i have explain this early and i will repeat it again so that no one get catch in an uncomfortable situation  getting an offer and submit a medical in qp be not a signal to move  until you get the final offer letter and see the visa in your inbox do not resign i be sure in their email offer to you they will advise you not to resign until told  in qp thing move accord to your mobilization date and get your visa be not a big deal for qp  however the actual date of mobilization be pre determined   qp be usually too far ahead on the block before the mobilization date at time  the next step in your recruitment process be wait and ask question if you have any  your visa could be ready in 1 month or it can also be 4 months so just wait and do not resign from your current job   
dear tg  i would like to thank you for explain to me this impotant issue again  i have another question please  a per my remuneration package  they will pay me housing allowance but for the probation period they will provide me residence  do u have any idea if they will share people with me in the same place or i be gon na stay alone until the probation period finish  actually i be gon na ask them this question but first i wan na have an idea about that  thank you in advance  regards  
the type of accomodation depend on the type of status you have ask for  family or single and also on your grade senior or els  in either of these condition you will never be share your accomodation with anyone   ask all the question you wish to ask from hr they will help you  and also ask question wont change anything so there be no need to be hesitant   
thanks a lot  actually i ask for family status  anyway  i be gon na check with human resource  your cooperation be highly appreciate  best regard 
 tj quick question  what be the probaibility of get qp to provide the housing  my undertsanding that their policy now be give allowance instaed provide housing  howver a friend of mine work on qatagas ii and they provide the housing any thoughts qp also require a cnadidate to get a police clearance ce report from country of origin  the report must be endorse by the qatari embassy in the country of origin  in the usa  the embassy require that this report  must include finger pronts  should be  notarized by notary public  local  notarized by secreatry of state  state level  notarized by us department of state qatari embassy it be a long process and takes time  so start with get this report   as soon a possible   beacuse this can take couple month do not resign untill qp inform you e  
dear tj  thank you for your comment  regard the housing  i would like to inform you that in my case  they tell me that they will offer me housing until the i finish my probation period then they will pay may the housing allowance amount and i have to my an apartment villa by my self  regard the police ce report  i be not sure if what u mention in you comment be require from candidate from middle east  please if u have any idea  please let me know  best regard  
the original reason for qp offer temporary fully furnish accommodation for the initial period be so that incoming staff have the opportunity to settle in to the country and get a feel for what housing be available and where  i assume that the reason be still the same  
i totally agree with tg  sometimes thing happen and this be not unusual here in qatar  i know many people who resign from their job hop they will get the visa quickly and take up to 4 month  i work at hmc  they have their own immigration section and yet still they get me a visa in 6 week      so do not ever ever ever resign your job and stay home until you really see your visa number with your two eye   good luck 
dear dentist  thank you for all the advise  i really appreciate your cooperation  regards  
opportunities qatar petroleum technical site interview  elsalam alikom every one any one know about qatar petroleum technical site interview process  2days visit  a i recive the visit visa and they ask me for the earlist date to attand and also how much do it take to decide the day of interview   many thanks 
you have the answer in your question  
if you have be invite for interview in doha  it s likely  in my opinion  that you will be make an offer  the two day will allow enough time for you to undergo a medical  meet other staff management  have a look around doha  at housing available etc  good luck  
it sound that you say that the phone interview be enough for them and the 2 day visit be just to finalize the offer and medical check   thanks again dweller 
that be my opinion  
i already go for the interview on 30 5 2010 in ras laffan for one day just for about 30 mintues  very short  next day medical check it take about 4 hour then hr about one hour and the hr supervisor say he do not recive technical interview result so he can not decide the basic salary so i leave qatar next day and still wait dweller your opinion   
the interviewing department will endorse their evaluation about you to hr  if positive  hr will send you offer letter  after you have accept and agree the offer  you need to wait 2 3 month  sometimes longer than this period  for visa processing and wait for your schedule of mobiization  
 be   involve   for a number of year i be unable to comment on the time frame in which they work  it s probably a case  a superman09 say  of wait for the offer   
that take some posting  
i be interview for senior shift supervisor job but the system they have be not exist else where in the world so in their requriments they require shift supervisor in large utility even it s not the same like the one they have from this point the interview be not good cause we do not have the same background  me and the interviewer  so i think the interviewer evaluation will be negative  
what do you think about that 
salary and allowances qp vs  aramco anybody here who can give advice about work for qp vs  aramco  what be the main difference  pros cons between the two  i m in final talk with both company  no offer yet but look promise  background info  finance manager  40 year  divorce  currently with bp  uk national  
one be in saudi and the other be in qatar  
hello buddy  for me i advice you to take qp  i m work here morethan 5yrs only but this be a good company  i bet qp will give you best salary and allowance   robert  
when you ve reach final stage at both end  you should know good comparison  a ex qp employee  a cousin work with aramco  aramco offer good packages however qatar be certainly a good place to live in  
qp be in qatar which be good when you reside in qatar  aramco be in saudi which be good when you reside in saudi  both be top player in the world  it be up to you to decide  do not mention divorce to them  martial status for you be single currently  
go for aramco  batter lifestyle and save more  
stay 3 month without alcohol choose aramco  good package and good life  anyway if you be in some project on the east cost be very easy to reach barhain every week end and to have fun  good luck  ciao 
i have see people drink more in aramco than qatar or the uk  
yes be  ksa produce more alcoholic than australia  must be the boredom of living there that do it 
it be not a boredom for the muslim because of 2 holy masjid over there  one the makkah and the madinah  i prefer to die in a place like saudi where the 2 holy mosque be there  
ca n t think of who all those people cross the causeway each weekend must be from   
which be the best hospital for baby vaccination  our baby be schedule for his six month vaccination and we we wonder where to take him  some people say it depend on the freshness of the vaccine  be all common vaccination available everywhere  price be not an issue as long a our boy be safe  preferably afternoon clinic  
health and fitness vaccination for baby under visit visa dear all  i be plan to bring my wife and new bear baby here in qatar on visit visa  can i do my baby s remain vaccination from qatar  where i can do the remain vaccination  please help me  
aster medical centre  or any other private policlinics 
vaccinations for infants will be do at  mesaimeer  abo hamour  hc  primary health care corporation browse with the below detail and you can find the location map for the health center  mesaimeer health center  vaccinations centre  wikimapia vaccinations will be do for child on visit visa also  but you need to carry the vaccination card  list of vaccination  do in your country  also donot forget to take your r p card  wife s r p card and child s passport  visa copy  extended visa  for 6 month  
visit messaimer healthcentre  you should be able to get vaccination for child  no where else i guess other than private if they do  
is it free of cost  
yes  visit mesaimmer health center in abu hamour near qtel tower  i believe you have to pay for extra buck for non holder of hmc card  
if she be under visit visa  you can only have the vaccine thru private clinic or hospital  government hospital like hamad and health center require a residency visa and the green card or vaccination card  the baby should have a rp before you can apply a vaccination card  
possible with pvts  
you mean to say it be not possible be hmc  
it be possible if your baby have health card because they will not give you a vaccination card if you dont have a health card  and the requirement for health card be the residency visa  
mr richard you be pass the wrong information  visit visa person they can able to put the vaccination injection in mesaimer health center  baby passport  visa copy be enough  
moving to qatar child immunisation hi all  i be plan on come to doha with my 3 week old baby who have only get her bcg vaccination  i be wonder if it advisble to come and get the rest of her immunisation there in doha  or be it good for me to get them do here before travel there to doha  have any one have their child vaccinate here in doha  thanks in advance xoxo 
i would get all the vaccination do before you come  there be lot of good hospital here  so it be not a problem  however  i think you need proof of vaccination in small kid before you entry the country  i may be wrong  my thought be my own  but i doubt my mum would agree with some of them  
if you go to hamad hospital vaccine for kid under 1 be free  you can go to the private hospital but they be much more expensive unless you have insurance that cover them  both my kid be completely vaccinate in doha  bear here  now 1 and 3   the only concern might be transfer the record to your home country when you return  each country have different vaccine schedule  but  if you be here for a while you might as well do the doha schedule and finish it all here  for example  in the us they do n t do bcgs  but since i figure my kid would be here the first few year of their life so it be probably a good idea to do it  i m pretty sure you do n t need all the vaccine before arrive in doha  check with your employer  but i ca n t imagine they will turn away your 3 month old w o vaccine since i know they do n t check vaccine for adult at all  
they do with u  may have be my partner sponsor but i have to show all vaccination certificate  my thought be my own  but i doubt my mum would agree with some of them  
one thing you will learn be that laws rules be arbitrarily apply here  what be true for one person be not for the other  
thanks for your reply  errm  well im not work  im just come to stay with my husband  i already have my visa and all  it jut more like a return trip  i just come here to the uk to give birth  usa expat where do u get ur kid vaccination do  
 no need for any of that malcod  they will not ask you for vaccination record come into qatar  they only ask for them for school  the 2 month vaccination will cost you from qr 900  qr 1400 depend on the hospital     diplomacy be the art of say nice doggie  until you can find a rock  will rogers    
 i go to 3 place  hamad  doha clinic and al ahli  we do n t have insurance for a while  and we also want to try different place to find the best one  if you do n t have insurance  i d recommend the local clinic of hamad  the vaccine be free there for baby under 1  they only do vaccine a couple of time a week  so make sure you stop by first to check the hour  you ll need a medical  first  so bring the baby s rp  birth certificate  etc   you wo n t find many westerner there  or perhaps that s just my local branch  but they speak english well enough and it s free  if you do have insurance  i like doha clinic  staff be helpful and friendly  except dr khalid  he s a bit harsh  yell at my mom once for try to come to the appointment with me  and there be n t much of a wait  i use to go to al ahli but recently their wait have become hour long  with appointment   and since they have a   great   kid play area  my kid be always come home with some nasty sickness when w    
have it do before you travel 
thanks guy for your reply  we have medical insurance through my husband employer my kid and i be also cover  even if i didnt id rather pay no matter how much it be  u cant compromise with some thing  with my first bear we have always be go to doha clinic and theres one egyptian paediatrician there whose real nice  id would rather get it do here but my rp expire on 30th may  and it such a hassle to get it redone  
one thing to add be that they only deliver the polio vaccine orally here but they will give it via injection at the al alhi if you bring it in with you  
family life in qatar giving birth in al ahli hospital hello  i m 4 month pregnant and i have be see dr  najla at al ahli hospital  i plan to give birth there and i really aprecciate some consideration from woman who have deliver there  how be the deliver  it be normal labour or c section  are the nurse well prepared to take care of the baby   please  any information will be very important  thanks 
please consider hamad medical hospital  they be much more experienced and prepared  
al ahli be the best hospital in doha  
my friend have a beautiful baby girl yesterday morning at al ahli and she be very well take care of  
al ahli be the best  ofcourse the charge be little high  you will be charge something between 15  000  20  000 for a 3 day stay in c section  the staff be well experience with good behaviour  nothing to worry  good luck  
please consider another hospital  they be not experience and be not capable nor have any facility to take care of your baby  if there be any complication  i will pm you further detail  since i have to leave now  many serious incident have occur there over the past week and as much a 5 6 baby have have to be rush to hamad hospital because of gross medical negligence on the part of al ahli hospital  i personally know of 1 baby who be still in the ncu of hamad hospital now  that have to be transfer from al ahli  stay far away from al ahli hospital and consider hamad hospital  do you want to go to al ahli because u have the money or because u really care for your baby  
scorpio79  your last comment be uncalled for  are your fact correct  do you mean there be no nicu so ill baby have to be transfer to hmc  
same go for doha clinic  if anything go wrong  tha ambulance s be rush to hamad medical  why risk it  i know a girl that give birth at al ahli and the doctor stiched her up that she later could n t have sex with her husband  she have to go through a minor surgery to correct the mistake  please have faith in hamad medical  
thanks you all for the response  althought i must say that i ve be quite worry about some comment  are you people sure about those thing  that a ahli do n t have nicu    did you actually give birth on hamad or other hospital to say that or this be like that kind of stuff that you hear somebody say and reapeat a if be realy truth   i m ask because chosing a hospital doctor far away from your home country be a very dificult decision  and al ahli hospital do n t look like the kind of place you describe  i like to hear from someone who actually deliver there  is there anyone   thanks 
her first three be at hamad medical and her last child be bear in al ahli only because she want her husband to attend the delivery  she compare all four delivery and decide never to go back to al ahli  they be rude and break her water  without her approval  she be emotionally and phsycologically abuse by the nurse there  they would n t call her doctor when she be ask them to  we have to call her from our personal mobile  not a very pleasant experience  i m have all my child at hamad medical  
some of my friend wife deliver a baby in hamad  and im pretty sure it good  although the husband cant go inside the labor room  but all of them have be take care of

family life in qatar carseat law for child  is there a carseat law in qatar  is there a selection of carseats to buy in doha  
the carseat law here be a joke  the fine for have a child in your lap in the front seat be the same a talk on a hand held cell phone  i ve ask our pediatrician why there have n t be an all out education campaign but no one know  25 year behind syndrome i guess  carseats be available though  
you get a good selection of car seat here  try toys r us  babyshop or mothercare  
i highly suggest put your young one in a car seat  have you see the drive  not to mention the amount of accident that happen everyday  children be our most precious gift  and we need to protect and keep them safe  i have see good one at toys r us  good luck  also try consumer report for the new and great  
never hear about car seat law  but i still recommend you put your little on into car seat for their safety  not for fear of the law  plenty of choice  most shop like baby shop be toys r u sell them  
i buy my son graco car seat at toys r us  they have several brand to choose from  as far a carseats go  i send a letter to the sheikha  i think there need to be a law that to leave the hospital when you have a baby  you must have a car seat  it should be check by the hospital  
we take our son to a british nursery so i expect parent who drop off their kid there be westernized  if they re not expat  and be safety conscious  then one day  i saw an arab father strap his daughter into a bouncer that be on the floor of a minivan  i guess he figure that as long a his daughter be secure to something  then that s good enough         there s a wide variety of carseats here  mostly make by western company and the price be comparable to what you d pay  i know that britax convertible car seat be highly rat but i do n t think i saw any here  i also wonder  if the carseats be n t so expensive to the local and other nationality  will they be more wiling to secure their kid  
nicely do and well think from you  hopefully  they will listen to you  my love be with you all in christ jesus  so be it  1 corinthians  chapter 16  
thank you for your comments i be not suprised that there be no carseat laws the car seat be for my two sister inlaws that live in qatar  i be hop that if i send the seat a gift that they will use them  i be interested in the britax brand because they will safely hold a child in a 5 point harness for up to 80 lb  the seat be large and there be plenty of room so the child can use them comfortably for a long time  
hi  i m new to this forum  i feel very passionately about this topic  i have a 19 month old son and be very anal when it come to car seat  malaysia  where i come from  do not have car seat law in place but i still make sure that my son travel in a car seat  even if it s to the nearby shop  there be many available for purchase in malaysia but the price be far too expensive for the majority  a decent car seat could set some back two month wage  so i guess even if they be aware of the need for child car seat it be out of their reach and i guess they have other prioritoes like buy food to stay alive and have a roof over thier head  plus family in malaysia can have as many a 4  quite common  up to 14 child  imagine the logistical nightmare of move the family member around   i ve be stay and study in australia for the past ten year  when i get pregnant  i find out that hospital wo n t let you take your baby home unless you have a baby capsule  i totally s   
i have never understand the excuse that a person have too many child and can not afford to put their safety first  i think it s great that people have so many child but please do n t have so many if you their safety can not be a priority  did anyone hear about that study do in the states about the safety of carseats  only 2 pass    that be just unbelievable to me  people have be think that their child be safe because the car seat have pass regulation law  they obviously only pass at the minimum  
moving to qatar vaccinations need before i come to doha  i be in the process of come over to work in doha  i want to know if their be any specific shot and vaccination i should get before come over  i want to try and get these thing complete before i leave the us  any insight would be much appreciate  
yes there be  though it vary depend on which country you come from  in the uk  the doctor have a list of all country and the vaccination need for each  i ll imagine they have the same in the us  
i suggest go to visit your local gp and mention that you be move to qatar  they should have in their system what shots you need before come over  it be usually for hepatitis and thyfoid i think  please excuse the spelling  
hep a and hep b i think          he who dares wins 
it depend what you have have already  you do n t specifically need any extra vaccination as long a you be up to date with the usual one you have in the uk  not sure about us  but you can have rabies a optional if you want  although there be no requirement or need to have any extra protection here  it be important to remember that lot of people travel east on holiday and if you do you will need the standard typhoid  yellow fever  etc  children need to have be vaccinate against tb before they can start school  in the uk they no longer give bcg so important to get that do before you come  
also  if you have be vaccinate against hepb  tell them when you have your blood test a you will show a have antibody  there be a thread about this a while ago  ask apple for advice  she be the expert here  
 we have to have 3 different one when we come from the uk  none of which i d have previously in my life  i do n t realise there be   usual   one in the uk  now i m worried i ve miss out on some important vaccination   
i do n t have any vaccination before come here from the netherlands  doctors also do n t advise me to take any  i think you should be good as long a you have have the one you have a a child  and even if you do n t  your body have an immune system so it will be able to fight off the most not so serious disease  tb would be smart to have though  
as i say  the official advice be that you do n t have to  however  they may offer you rabies  typhoid and hep b a an option  as they no longer boost tetanus a routine  you would have to have a booster before come  that say  the uk have a vey hand off approach to immunisation at the moment a most disease be sufficiently cover by herd immunity  where because the majority have be vaccinate the people who have n t be cover to a large extent  and case be low  personally as long a there be a low risk  i would have all the vaccination i could  why not  
 but since i be here  i have have rabies and tetnus  both due to a friendly  doggie i be rescue      if you do n t like the heat  get out of the kitchen  but stop try to fan the flame before you leave  it will burn you on the a  a you go through the doorway     me visit www qaws org  
 we come from here from the us and have hep a  typhoid  and tdap  combine tetanus  diptheria  pertussis  on top of the usual program  the hep a be a two dose one  give six month apart  we go to our local kelsey seybold clinic there and be give an international certificate of vaccination a approve by the world health organisation     there s this thing call be so open minded your brain drop out     richard dawkins  
qatar living lounge  schools to remain closed after 4th oct  rumour be circulate that the school will not re open on the 4th oct but will remain closed for long  anyone know the truth  anyone in the min of ed willing to help parent  school business in qatar out of this uncertainty and give an unequivocal answer    an education be n t how much you have commit to memory  or even how much you know  it s be able to differentiate between what you do know and what you do n t     
i hope it will remain a a rumour and that the school opening will push through on oct 4 a we have be informed  school have be delay long enough  
thats the rumour  we know as much a parent do  at the moment we be in school with no kid hop that they be back next week

get sufficient dosage for h1n1 vacines  we have read in paper they get sufficient stock and school may not postpone far  already many work parent have problem to adjust  
question at hand  be these so called vaccine prove safe  
to keep away the student from recently attack virus   many family be back from their homeland   if any be affect   will be precure  till school reopen    safety first   a i heard   
there be no h1n1 vaccine  it be not ready  they want to vaccine all kid and staff with the normal seasonal flu vaccine  which i be guess will have no effect on the h1n1 virus  i know i be a teacher 
ya could be possible though

if they be banned   a you suggest  then it obviously mean that your be not allow to bring them into qatar  
 they be definitely ban in qatar  so a lp say  how do you want to import something which be ban  custom be not go to let them in  frankly speaking  for me it sound a bit nonsense   very well behaved people friendly pitbulls    a for me  these two do n t come together  it s either   very well behaved people friendly   or   pitbulls    sorry  eh   hope your husband wo n t be able to figure out my real name and address

thank you and it s good to know that there be some moral and responsible pitty owner in qatar  some of the web sit i ve see make me sick at how people be take these normally people love animal and misusing and abuse them for sport  and then people who be n t inform blame the dog who be the one be abuse  not the one do the abusing in the first place   
there be several pet relocators here in qatar and i suggest you contact them regard your dog  check here on qatar iving for the pets  animal section and it will give you the info on pet here in qatar as well a the different pet organization  
 one caveat  if you can  and there be official channel to follow  get your dog here never leave them alone or off leash  not because of them but because of the sickos who see the breed and assume they be fight dog  i have a shepherd and i ve lose count of how many time someone have want to   buy   her  she s big and black and they see her a a fighter because of that   
yes you can bring it but be careful this kind of dog be very very very dangerous  because i have one that my friend bring it to my last year from kuwait  you can talk to doha airport to be sure about that

it wont be snow  but you do sometimes need to switch ur heater on  d 
you re from poland  i m sure you can handle winter here  last year it go down up to 14 degree  but it s already too cold for me  i have to wear winter clothes with globe and boot  
last year i hear the temperature be 9 degree  hehe  it wo n t be cold  but you need a thin coat especially in the evening  and it s rain sometimes  too  
winter in doha be splendid  the climate be mild during the day and cold if the wind blow  it be real cool at night  no snow except your freezer ice maker  cardinal of qatar living 
thin coat bet you now you wear that thin coat here in winter specially in dune at night it totally like a freezer i couldnot step out of my car and turn that damn heater on full mode and the moment i would step out the cool breeze go through out my soul  where a i belong to a place where there be snow and extremly cold temp might drop even to 5 sometimes  but this winter here in qatar be kinda strange   img nid 21285 title desc link none align left width 180 height 180  
well   so i see that warm clothes be need during the winter  i ve always consider qatar a really hot country  and probably it be but only during the summer  so average temperature in winter be about 14 c  sunny  
temp can drop to 10 or 8 also here  yea it sunny and it cloudy also and raisn too and when it rain then the temp drop  last year all the outlet in qatar be runout of heaters  they have to import thousand of them from dubai   img nid 21285 title desc link none align left width 180 height 180  
it kinda get pretty cold  as darude say  8 to 10 degree  this may sound high  but when it rain or there be a wind  it feel much colder  i will second darude  last year  there be a shortage of room heater in qatar  people be even willing to pay a premium for a small one  better to be prepare than spend sleepless night shiver with the cold  granted the cold snap do not last long  but who would want to give up their sleep  days be pretty warm  last year  i think  it be about a day or three that be very cold during the day and that be due to heavy rain  
i remember last winter be so cold but i do n t have any heater  so i have to cover up in thick blanket lol  does n t help that i have tile flooring as well  in general though  winter time be usually great for me  i think the weather can be perfect   cost of living  visas  saftey info  tips on moving  facts  pictures  videos  and more

i m not expert or doctor neither as far a i know any throat infection or cough inflamation that last a week or more than it be already a allergy  if you have doubt on your doctor s prescription well yet get second opinion  note  antibiotics here in doha be control drug so you cant just buy it in by the counter you must have prescription

i be a fake doctor  trust me  gargle with jack daniels and you ll be fine

don d mind ripe cord  in his previous life  he be a cat get abandon near a dumpster by his owner  sad story  really  qaws be still operate but only until the end of september  visit their facebook page if you want to see what cat be available for adoption  it cost 500qr per cat for their vaccination  neutering and microchip  
qaws be n t shut down yet  they just ca n t receive animal no more  i ve be there several time and the cat be gorgeous  i d recommend 2nd chance rescue as well  sadly they do n t receive cat anymore either   
1  qaws  shut down end of september  so please consider this your first stop a they have ton of animal to rehome   2nd chance rescue  cats in qatar  and qatar veterinary center  look them all up on facebook for news and picture of their current adoptable cat  some ask a small fee to cover money already spend on the cat spaying neutering  microchip and vaccination cost  and some be completely free  2  depending on the kind of cat and where you go  it can be from 75qr to as much a 250qr for groom  more reputable place such a the big vet  parkview  qvc  will charge more  3  anywhere from 100 500qr depend on what you need do  
grooming be n t really necessary unless you get a persian or long haired cat  save yourself the money and hassle and get a short haired arabian mau  they re hearty cat and you wo n t have a lot of health problem with them which will cut down on vet cost

alyson  you can get royal canin for cat here  i always buy the hairball control at doha vets  if they do n t have the specific for persian  they ll probably order it for you  i think their website be www dohavets com or something like that  if i may suggest  if you use an enclosed litter box  bring one with you  a they be very expensive here  qr250 for a really cheap look one   also bring toy  they be not easy to find here  and stuff like nail clipper as well  oh  and frontline be also quite expensive here  and i have n t find the specific one for cat  the vet tell me to simply put less of the dog one  anyway  those be the thing you should know if you re bring kittie with you

pets and animals is it safe and worthy to buy a pup from souq waqif   dear dog lovers in qatar  here s a query for u myself go to sq wqf and fell in love with a 1 month old pup   he be so cute  dint have the heart to leave him there   he be cost 1800  buck  please let me know  if anyone have buy a pup from this place  also  let me know if it can be keep in a flat  since it quite small  i need to keep one coz i want my doter to have the experience of have and take care of a pet  
no  a one month old puppy be n t old enough to leave it mother and anyone selling it know nothing about dog or their care or their health  you will be get a sick dog that will cost you ten of thousand of riyal over the next month or year  
it s only a dog  go ahead and buy it if you have the cash for such a luxury  
a good and more deserving place to get a pup be from the animal care centre  it use to be call paws and claws   not sure what it be call now  we get a saluki pup from there for our daughter and he be now a grown dog  an absolute darling and a stress reliever for my daughter and everyone else in the house  when we get him  he be not even a month old and his eye be not yet foccused  i understand his parent be run wild on a farm and the cop come  round them up and shoot the parent  but paws and claws save many of the orphan pup and bring them to their centre  we pay them only qr 100 as donation for the pup  he have diarrohea and need treatment thereafter  there be good vetinary clincs in doha  but still it be a bit expensive  even then  it be worth spending on a pup which your daughter can cuddle  hug and love  if thing go rough in school and her friend and teacher be mean  the dog be someone she would try to confide in  althought be can not speak back   
buying a dog puppy for your daughter be a very big decision  you have to consider many thing before you decide on something  we have get a shiranian  shihtzu pom  for our 3yr old son  believe it be a very good decision  both be very good pal now  factors  how old be your daughter  if she be below 5 year  make sure she have a toy group  very quiet and playful puppy  if she be big may be you can get a big one  because size and attitude of dog will matter is your daughter asthmatic or ill constantly  get low shed or no shed dog  is she ready for responsibility  can she clean  groom your pet  if not  you should be ready to do it for her  so that she doesnot feel distant from her pet  flat  staying in a flat  then you have to definitely get a quieter dog so that your neighbour dont complaint against you and regard toilet training you dont have to worry  it will be tough initially but be persistent and you can work it out  use a crate initially to keep your pet and   
unfortunately the animal sell at souq wagif be in miserable condition so you will pay 3 time what you pay for the dog just to get it healthy  i be in search of a siamese cat and buy a kitten there it take 3 week of hourly care and lot of vet bill to keep the animal alive  its a shame the govt  do not close it down it a menace to animal lover  so do n t buy the puppy and as state it too young as well  
i would n t reccoemnt buy any animal from the souq  they be seriously mistreat  you only have to go and see them keep in the cage and spray with water to see that  and by buy one of these animal you be only far encourage the seller to mistreat animal  as others have say  there be good place to get animal  such a any of the vet who always have animal for adoption either in the centre or advertise on the board   finally  please consider if you and your daughter be ready for a dog  i personally  would n t have a dog in a my small 2 bed flat  i do  however  have a cat  dogs must be walk every day  even in the heat of summer    what will you do if you go on annual leave  dogs be more expensive to be look after than cat because they need more attention  are you ready to pay high vet bill if your pet get sick and can you afford the right amount of food every day  if you be confident that you be ready for a dog  then i wish you and your daughter the b   
why buy a pup when you can get one for free  i have a friend who have 10 of them  he take a bitch in and have no idea she be pregnant  message me if you want his detail  
please do not buy any dogs or cats from any souqs or pet shops  a 4 week old puppy should still be with it s mother  the chance be that if you take it home  you will get attach to it and then it will die  it s too young to be away from it s mum  it s too young to be vaccinate  it wo n t have have proper puppy formula or health treatment  please save yourself a lot of heartache and stay away from dog and puppy in the souqs  they be normally sick  not vaccinate or too young  some have disease that can be pass to human and you never know if the dog maybe belong to somebody already and it have be stolen found and sell to the pet shop  if you seriously want a dog and be ready for the committment for the next 15 year  please contact one of the animal rescue group or adopt a pet from a family  and make sure that whatever animal you get  it must have be vaccinate and neuter  
if you be still think about get a puppy and feel you be ready you can contact dogs in doha http  dogsindoha weebly com index html or qaws http  www qaws org index2 php

family life in qatar doggy dog hi  i would really love to get a small puppy dog for my kids but i be worry about the kind of lifestyle we would have like be we allow to bring dog to the mall  or be there very restricted area for dog  i would want to bring my small dog to place if possible  any advice would be appreciate  
dogs be not allow in most public place  that be why if you want a dog  a garden should be a must and an area to walk it around your house  aisha taweela 
you would not be allow to take a dog to the mall  but there be plenty of place you can take them for a walk if you do n t mind drive a little bit  you would also have to check with your landlord that you re allow to keep a dog in your villa apartment  obviously a garden be ideal for a dog  but it be possible to keep one in an apartment block  as long a you re willing to take it out for walk everyday  i suggest you talk to these people  www qaws org 
thank you for the advice  i hope to get a villa eventually  that be the deal for get a dog here  but i still really want to get one  do n t fear  we will take time to think it over before get a dog  do u tallg and aisha have dog  
my advice to you would be to come to qatar first check out the type of villa your get and adopt a dog from qaws there be many cute doggy look for a nice home   good fortune always come knock at your door  when you be sh tting in the toilet         smoke     
yes i have a dog  we have foster one from qaws and she s awesome  we re lucky to have a large patch of land behind our compound where we can take her for walk  
 also bear in mind how long you will be stay in qatar for  and what the quarantine law be like in your home country if you decide to move back  if you plan an get a dog and then get rid of it again when it s time to leave  that s just plain wrong    never argue with idiot  they ll drag you down to their level  then beat you with experience     
no i do not have a dog  but use to have dog in the past  had 1 dog for 16 year and he travel everywhere with me  now i be a muslim and in islam one should not have a dog inside the house  to have a dog here in this weather  only keep him outside be unfair to the dog  so now i have cat  aisha taweela 
well  we be in doha now  just get an apt  and hope to stay for a while  i know the dog at the qaws shelter need help but i really want to get a puppy for my kid to grow with i find it safe  i will keep an eye on puppy  i be look for a dog breed that do not bark too much in case it bother the neighbour and we get in trouble  we be really take our time to make a decision  but when i see picture of puppies i get the impulsive bug  i will keep read all of your advice and story to help me make a decision  thank you  
lots and lot of puppy at qaws  http  www qaws org adoption dogs php please go and have a look there before consider other option  the shelter be currently full and can not take any more stray dog  so if you adopt from there you be free up space for another stray to be take in  
hey guy  just pick up 2 wander dog near aspire zone  would be good for a family  look to be about 2 3 month old  really need a home asap  give me a call if you want  have post pic of them in help  advice section  i ve have my own 2 dog here for 4 month  walk them around our compound at night and take them run on the side street at night when it s be cool enough w o any problem  have also walk them on the corniche without problem  thank you for the help  whalin 602 7736

doha shopping prado or pajero prado or pajero be the best for doha  calculate comfort resale value maintainence cost etc   which one do u prefer between these two   
   only in dreams never in reality   prado prado  prado  pajero very common    
go for prado  
go for pajero 
go for pajero 
lol the pajero will give you the tourist  or typical expat  look  you definitely do n t want that if you try to mix with the population  prado be the obvious superior choice on whatever angle you look at it  pajero be definitely not build to suffer the driving in qatar  after 100k your typical pajero break down and your prado laugh all the way to the bank  
how you can ever compare toyota with mitsubishi    this too shall pass    img nid 71431 title magic ring desc link none align left width height 0  
prado all the way 
i have a pajero  it be capable off road  it be really comfortable to drive and to sit in  has a cooler in the middle console  i think they keep their resale value from what i have see  either way i do n t think you can go wrong

family life in qatar carseat law for child  is there a carseat law in qatar  is there a selection of carseats to buy in doha  
the carseat law here be a joke  the fine for have a child in your lap in the front seat be the same a talk on a hand held cell phone  i ve ask our pediatrician why there have n t be an all out education campaign but no one know  25 year behind syndrome i guess  carseats be available though  
you get a good selection of car seat here  try toys r us  babyshop or mothercare  
i highly suggest put your young one in a car seat  have you see the drive  not to mention the amount of accident that happen everyday  children be our most precious gift  and we need to protect and keep them safe  i have see good one at toys r us  good luck  also try consumer report for the new and great  
never hear about car seat law  but i still recommend you put your little on into car seat for their safety  not for fear of the law  plenty of choice  most shop like baby shop be toys r u sell them  
i buy my son graco car seat at toys r us  they have several brand to choose from  as far a carseats go  i send a letter to the sheikha  i think there need to be a law that to leave the hospital when you have a baby  you must have a car seat  it should be check by the hospital  
we take our son to a british nursery so i expect parent who drop off their kid there be westernized  if they re not expat  and be safety conscious  then one day  i saw an arab father strap his daughter into a bouncer that be on the floor of a minivan  i guess he figure that as long a his daughter be secure to something  then that s good enough         there s a wide variety of carseats here  mostly make by western company and the price be comparable to what you d pay  i know that britax convertible car seat be highly rat but i do n t think i saw any here  i also wonder  if the carseats be n t so expensive to the local and other nationality  will they be more wiling to secure their kid  
nicely do and well think from you  hopefully  they will listen to you  my love be with you all in christ jesus  so be it  1 corinthians  chapter 16  
thank you for your comments i be not suprised that there be no carseat laws the car seat be for my two sister inlaws that live in qatar  i be hop that if i send the seat a gift that they will use them  i be interested in the britax brand because they will safely hold a child in a 5 point harness for up to 80 lb  the seat be large and there be plenty of room so the child can use them comfortably for a long time  
hi  i m new to this forum  i feel very passionately about this topic  i have a 19 month old son and be very anal when it come to car seat  malaysia  where i come from  do not have car seat law in place but i still make sure that my son travel in a car seat  even if it s to the nearby shop  there be many available for purchase in malaysia but the price be far too expensive for the majority  a decent car seat could set some back two month wage  so i guess even if they be aware of the need for child car seat it be out of their reach and i guess they have other prioritoes like buy food to stay alive and have a roof over thier head  plus family in malaysia can have as many a 4  quite common  up to 14 child  imagine the logistical nightmare of move the family member around   i ve be stay and study in australia for the past ten year  when i get pregnant  i find out that hospital wo n t let you take your baby home unless you have a baby capsule  i totally s   
i have never understand the excuse that a person have too many child and can not afford to put their safety first  i think it s great that people have so many child but please do n t have so many if you their safety can not be a priority  did anyone hear about that study do in the states about the safety of carseats  only 2 pass    that be just unbelievable to me  people have be think that their child be safe because the car seat have pass regulation law  they obviously only pass at the minimum  
welcome to qatar motor insurance in doha having read a lot about about the hectic  driving in doha i be wonder whether car insurance be quite costly  i m a 25 year old male from the uk and i ve never make a claim  be i likely to be pay through the roof to insure my v8 4x4 that i intend to buy when i move to doha next month  
insurance be between 3  and 4  a year  and seriously  while the drive keep you on your toe  it be n t that bad  
is that a percentage of the cost of the car  it ca n t be much bad than the m25 in the uk during rush hour  that s pretty much a 80mph free for all anyway  
yep  a a percentage of value of car  i recommend you first hire a car for a week or two so you get use to the roundabout with someone el wheel g  
well  it be 3  in the first year anyway  i think the insurance company might have agreement with the insurance carrier and direct buyer to a particular insurance agency  invariably you will return to the insurance company you use when you buy the car  when the annual renewal come up though you may find that it be way high than 3   or else we be n t skilled persistent enough to negotiate it down to 3    here be a short blog about our experience with car insurance renewal  http  tinyurl com elmrk from my blog about life in qatar  http  www xanga com bbetz 
 i think people who choose to drive huge suv s should pay a premium  call it   no peripheral vision   clause   
life only can be understood backwards  but must be live forward  car insurance not really that bad  in the uk you insure the driver  in here you insure the car  so anyone can drive the car and still insure  if you know what i mean  we pay around 2000 qr for our car  again our car be not a posh car     
novita  that be to be understood per annum or a a monthly fee  raggers 
beware  i think you will find that the car be cover for accident but not people in the car  you may need to take out seperate insurance for the passenger  fully comprehensive in qatar be not the same a fully comprehensive in the uk 
car insurance be quite different from western practice  as noted above  you insure the car  not the driver  which be one of the reason kid here can afford to drive massive landcruisers  despite the slaughter of pedestrian   blood money for non moslems be pretty minimal  anyway   for car over a certain age   2 year  dunno  3rd party be the only option  however  and again a note above  cover for passenger be not automatic so check these thing carefully with your insurance broker  even the possibility of have residual alocohol in your bloodstream when some idiot slam into you some morning have to be specifically cover  so it s not a bad idea to go to a reputable international insurance company if you think you might occasionally have non family passenger or drink beer of an evening  
when you take out full insurance  you will normally be offer the choice of insure the driver and ex number  you choose  of passenger  additionally  a state  you can insure against be over the limit  excess alcohol   although i do not know what would happen if a driver be drunk and have an accident

child safety seat salaam hello can anyone tell me what be the law about car seat for child in qatar  i m sure i can buy them there but also wonder if i should bring what i have or buy there  thanks  
qatar living lounge child seat belt while drive in doha last night i witness a sad incident  a man be drive with his child on his lap  he have to make an emergency stop and his child head impact the steer wheel  the poor child be bleed and cry  many time i have see child not properly secure in vehicle  is there not a law regard child safety in vehicle here in qatar  
there be a law  no child under 10 in the front seat  unfortunately this law be not enforce  did you take the guy license plate  and report him  maybe if he get a large fine it would impact him rather than his child  poor child have an idiot for a parent  
yes there be a law  unfortunately  not too much enforcement and some people be too arrogant to follow  i see lot everyday  
i do that once  went to the police to report it  policeman tell me it be not my kid and not my business  
sadly  we can not do anything   i feel sorry for those poor kid who be unlucky to have parent like that  
yes youuu bugger  not your kids not your problem  how dare youuuu  mind your business       jockin  mode off  
i see child with no seat belt on all the time  jumping up and down in the back  on someone lap in the front and lean between the 2 front seat from the back    do some parent not care for the safety of their child or what      there be so many accident here and a child would fly through the front window should a car have an accident and most probably result in death  please peeps keep your child seatbelted in the back of the car otherwise you could find yourself lay them to rest before you pass away

i hate to say this  body bag come in many shape and size  lately toddler size be very common  i lift two body bag in my life and plenty of coffin  still be not a good feeling to find out the reason for death it be stupidity and lack of safety  respectfully due to the recession  to save on energy cost  the light at the end of the tunnel will be turn off  god graduated from xavier institute for higher learning 
several time i ve see here people drive with one hand at the steer wheel and the other hand carry i guess less or more than a year old kid  tsk tsk tsk  perhaps do n t know of responsible parenting  cogito  ergo  sum   
 in this region subscribe to  but in the end  it s just a stupid rationalization for not do what would keep your child safe  especially in light of recent stats on road injury per caput in qatar    qatar suffer four time more injury in road accident per 100  000 people than the second placed country  kuwait  and tie with south africa for the most road death  the report show      you d think they might want to start enforce the law on the book  i feel sorry for the kid who have these people a parent  but i guess it s just social darwinism in action   quote from  http  www thepeninsulaqatar com display asp  section local  month september2009  file local xml    marriage be a wonderful institution  but who want to live in an institution     groucho marx  
family life in qatar no fine 4 travel with baby in front seat hi all good morning i would like to know whether qatar gov have stop impossing fine for trvling with kid in front seat  these day i find every mother sit in front with their kid  i too have a kid and would love to do so  but hesitant a not sure about the rule    you have any idea  
you would love to kill your child  what  what kind of horrible parent be you  
you can sit with a baby gorilla in the front seat  but dont u ever sit with ur kid in the front seat if u really love ur kid      
you re kid  right  
honestly  you would put any child in a car without a car seat  and in the front seat just because the police seem not to be enforce a law at this time  are you insane  the only safe place for young child be in the back seat and in a car seat that be properly instal  may safety prevail  please  
      
aimforoutlastlife  u dont need to make tat face     we be just tell for you and ur kid safety  its good to be on safe side then to be sorry later   cheerz 
guy you can tell her politely also  why be so harsh  be u guy breakfast be chilly tea 
well in my opinion your child brain splatter across the pavement be a pretty harsh image ingeniero  
sorry guy  it just becos i didnt foresee    in our country there be no such rule and the drive be bore if husband sits in front like a driver and we in back seat i do love my kid      with god grace didnt hear of any accident    may be that make me think so   but these dys most kid r in front seat 
if you re child be in a proper car seat you would n t have to sit in the back with it  it s dangerous for your child to be out of a car seat  front or back

qatari culture it be very dangerous              just a question  why do n t qatari people buckle up their child in the car  i even saw a lot of baby on their mother s lap in the front seat  this be too dangerous    please do it for the child       
what be the hospital for they also need to work so no problem let them drive a they like  d  img nid 13339 title desc link none align left width 180 height 180

wake up lazy bone lazy soul lazy a    sleep here be this ur bedroom  p no this be ql  d  img nid 13339 title desc link none align left width 180 height 180  
there s an unenforced law where child under 10 need to be in the backseat  there s no law to where child need to be strap into child safety seat  there s no awareness  there s ignorance  the sight of a baby rid in dad s lap a dad be drive be quite common  quite horrific  
give s me the shiver everytime i see little kid sit on the driver lap  and to think that there s alot of accident go on here  
i know it be a rhetorical question  but here be an answer  it s call ignorance  
it get really dangerous when the dad be let the kid steer the car  
do they not broadcast on television any public safety announcement advertisement like we have in the uk  if people saw something like that and still do n t use seatbelt for their child  they should be warn their child could be remove from their care for reason of child endangerment  that s quite shocking  
dear serendipity who be wathching qtv anyway now a day   
to my great surprise there be a article in gulftimes say htat 17  people in qatar watch qtv  believe it or not   lol despite the cost of live life s still popular  
family life in qatar car seat what carseat brand be available in qatar  i m just not sure if i should bring the kid carseats from norway  not sure how the airline will treat the seat  and be a bit worried that they will break them  
 while car seat be available in qatar  they re bind to be pricy than the one you have already  and the selection will not exactly   wow   you  unfortunately i ca n t tell you what brand be available here since i have n t pay them any attention  i bring my two britax boulevards with u from the u s  and they come through fine  i do recommend purchasing car seat travel bag if you can find them in norway because it will definitely help keep the cloth cover in good shape  if you ca n t find them  though  the airline will put it in a very heavy duty plastic bag  hope that help  expat sue o p s  i be start a mums and kids group here in doha for expat  be sure to get in touch with me when you arrive  or before if you have any question   we ll have playgroups  mums night out  and expectant moms group  etc  there be no due or anything like that   just fun  o   
we bring ours from the uk  we just bubble wrap it and check it in with the rest of the lugguage simple a that           he who dares wins 
thank you  then i just have to pack our seat  it s not desided jet if we do move to qatar  i m just try to figure out what we might have to bring if we do end up in qatar  
i be surprise at how many people do n t use car seat here in qatar  everytime i see one of these little angel bop around in this traffic it give me nightmare  
 this be one of my pet peaves  back home  houston  texas  child  accord to their age  must be in a car seat  knowing that this law do not exist here and how upset i would get  my husband warn me before hand    now  you re gon na see a lot of child that should be in car seat and they re not    not have child in carseats  in the event of an accident  can lead to paralysis or even death  everyone should wear their safety belt  sad story   i be a high school teacher  one of my student  eric  have just earn a full football scholarship to the university of texas  one night  he be in the backseat of a mid size car and have fall asleep and be not wear his seat belt  the driver of the car eric be in be in an accident another driver have run a red light and side swipe their car  eric be the only one rush to the hopital  the others have be wear their seatbelt and be not injure  eric be paralyze  consequently  he be not able to play ball for ut  the ut law    
   dgoodrebel will always be the rebellious good one    
cynbob  my child be not to ride in a car without the right carseats  my first thought be to leave my car seat her in norway  so that when we come for a visit the grandparent have seat for them  if i can t be sure to get well know car seat in qatar  i will bring the seat that we have here  a little more luggage  but nothing be more important than the safety of the child  
 amen  nothing be more important and i believe that you and the others that utilize their car seat for their little one  and big one for that matter  be set a great example  maybe it will actually   catch on   here    sad memory  i remember get to the hospital that night after another teacher call with the news  the rest of the family be there as well  how tragic  in time  the news spread of how a fellow classmate  a close friend to many  be not go to be able to walk and play ball  others vow to   buckle up   a we say in south texas  they have learn a hard lesson  if this story help even one person remember to take the time to use seatbelts car seat  it be worth sharing  the good news  he go on to complete his degree from ut  i last heard he be in law school with hope of become a lawyer specialize in defend right for the disabled   
to think that poor boy have the rest of his life ahead of him only to have it all disappear because he do n t wear a seatbelt  who could have imagine that would have ever happen  so where be the best place to buy car seat around here  
why be people so careless with the life of their child  i can t undestand it  my mother in law walk the street in our smal town  with a stroller  for four hour while she wait for me to get out of work  just because she didn t know if she have put the seat in the right way  she didn t take the chance  never gamble with your child life  i could never live with myself if something happen to any of my child because i didn t use a car seat

and some other unmotherly stunt thus her losing custody  temporarily  of her kid  i be concerned myself a i see kid stand inside move car  a sudden jolt or stop would hurt these kid  and with the new traffic law create and inplemented  i think they should include law regard child safety  what you be be what you have be  and what you will be be what you do now   buddha 
 but there be actually no law for child care  i mean she still can sit on her mom s lap and no one will violate her  but of course for the safety it s good not to do it   http  www showcaseyourmusic com littleguitarist   never interrupt your enemy when he be make a mistake    napoleon bonaparte  1769 1821   
 no it be against the new drive law thank god   i fight with love and i laugh with rage  you have to live light enough to see the humor and long enough to see some change    ani difranco

hahaha tb 
so you should n t drive safely around car with young child in them

qatar living lounge child die in school bus in dps today child return late from school  dps mis   the reason be a child be find dead in the school bus  from what i hear  the child doze off in the bus during her morning trip  the driver do not notice and the child be leave in the bus  they find her in the afternoon  it should have be the heat in the bus that kill her  she be just 4 year old  did anyone hear about this  
what be   dps mis   
better confirm the news before spread this or else this will become a rumor  
yes i hear about that if it true who r the responsible for that  1  all the school management should think about school timing 2 parents should give them enough time to take good sleep in this advanced system we r torture our little angel to be in race 
i think this happen a few year ago  or at least there was such a case a few year ago  
initially wen i call a teacher she deny this  but they confirm this to the newspaper  any school should set guideline  even if a child get a good sleep  it be normal for her to fall asleep in bus  buses come as early a 6 a m  
there be a similar case in abudhabi last year i think   look like this type of incident be not uncommon in this temperature  schools need to be extra cautious with strict law  
there be a similar case in some other gulf country  i think i read about this around a year back 
what        this be irresponsible from school  govt of qatar should take actoin fot bad job shame shame dps kill one child one family  
this news seem true and school have express condolence and a holiday tomorrow  really the school authority need to be more responsible especially when they charge way too much in term of special fee and all when compare to other school in doha  the facility tey lack and the amount of negligence show be too much  there be no conductor in most bus  even the one in which small kid travel  and even after complain to the school many time  there be no action  many bus be hire and be drive by irresponsible driver who dont care about anything  another issue be the school building which have be sooo long under planning and fund raising stage  what be the management of the school do happily run their own business and drain all the money from the parent without give anything back to the school the school management should be hold responsible for the extremely poor porta cabin in which they teach the junior wing and the lack of responsibility in issue r   
how can the supreme education council not see the poor condition in which this so called high profile school be run

family life in qatar wakra beach hi everybody as everybody know  that beach be just a big dump of trash  why we do n t organize some kind off group that could take care  clean and protect the beach  do anybody know where to start  and do we need authorization from the government to take some action  like grade and clean the beach  some money will be need  if there be a start point i can participate with 1000 rial  maybe it seam like a crazy idea  but qatar deserve it  not just come here and take the money 
i live near wakra beach and no way i see it a a big dump of trash  i may be wrong  go and have a look before jump in to pre meditated conclusion  can see it a a ban spoon feeding not me 
there was a ton of garbage in the spring  but not sure how clean it be now  canadian school organize an environment day to clean up the beach in may 07  with 10 child and three adult  we manage to collect a dozen garbage bag full of stuff include and old tire  carpet  load of glass bottle  ton of bottle cap  etc  etc  
cleaning of beach can be a one time activity but continuous will be big project  
i go there almost every weekend  cause i plan to do some kite there be broken glass  bottle  tire  carpet  plastic bag everywhere  month of may be long go  i think rent a heavy machine to grade  and remove all the trash  be a morning job  and everybody will profit it  is unbelievable  the amount of broken plastic chair  and stuff you can find there  i think the beach deserve our respect and protection  i m not criticize  but the damage be do  and action and not word need to be take  every time i go there i bring my trash  and some time pick some plastic bottle around  now there be a big dump of sand  maybe for construction  in a country almost like an island  not have a proper beach to go  be a shame  i can use hotels  but to be honest for example the beach of the resort in messaid be worst  not only the trash but boat and jet ski like fly s  check mate   
that everyone feel it be the job of expat to clean up this country and the role of the local to trash it in the first place  i for one always pack out my garbage  always bury and disperse my campfire and practice zero impact camping and picnicking  i know many others that do the same but the amount of litter i ve see throw out the window of landcruisers suggest that prevention need to be see a the big part of the solution  please do n t try to lay guilt trip on me for these one  when i start to see convoy of qataris take pride in and clean up their own country  and not pay sri lankans a pittance to do it for them   i ll gladly stop and lend a hand   since allah have give me a brain  it would seem like a sin not to use it  
is there any environmental authority that i can contact our qatari interested to start something really positive for that beach  as national a qatari will have more support from government  i think  check mate   
great initiative rassadko  hope you will succeed  just be patient  i know there be a lot of people who be willing to give a hand or two  goodluck  in victus 
best way to predict the future be to invent it      good to know people like rassadko feel that we should do something for this place  but it not go to change with just some clean up process once in a way  we need to have people patrol the place and fine them on the spot whenever they be see littering unless  some strict measure which apply both to the local and resident apply  this country will not improve  
beach to clean  the construction go there take care of everything and clean the beach of everything even the sand  these guy never have a dull moment  do construction everywhere and damage more than constructing  wait for another 2 year and there would be no need to clean the beach  the cleaning staff would do the rest and you have to pay to visit the beach   do not dwell in the past  do not dream of the future  concentrate the mind on the present moment   gautama buddha  
king edshel  very true   ban spoon feeding not me 
qatar living lounge dukan beach hi  hello everybody   can any of you advice me be to go for in weekend in qatar   actually i be plan to go to dukan beach but some guy r tell me to visit om said sea line resort   i be really confused   please can any one of u guide me properly  and how much time do it take to reach both    
 you have a chilled pool and can get food  if you re live life on the edge  you ve get too much room  
thanks for the advice  but if we just want to see beach then be beach at dukan oke for it   
i think so  if you only want to see sea beach then dukhan be ok  there be no shark but there be channa fish at dukhan  beware of channa fish  they be very dangerous  especially during the onset of winter  they generally do n t attack human  but if they be hungry they may eat human  this happen especially when the channa grow old and lazy and do n t want to hunt  then they come near the beach to grab easy prey  the human bather   if you want to be safe from the channa eat lot of garlic and apply garlic spray on your body because  the only thing that can repulse a channa be garlic  have a nice swim at dukhan  cya  
 beware  channa fish be   mumeater     
as i always say  qatar have 563 km of coastline  it should be easy to find a view of a beach   
the channa fish be a voracious eater  it can eat anything  even pet bottle  thats why it weigh 200 kg  
md 563km of coastline  does it include the pearl qatar or not  
i do n t know  edifis  ask the cia who produce the world factbook  please  
neither of them go to fuwairit beach or khataiyat beach they be nice and not crowd at all  
darude  where be that khataiyath beach

ukeng  p 
why to go to the border when u hav well beach like gharia  sealine  fuwariait etc  
over night and then um bab  where if you want to buy something  you have to come to dukhan  
why be it unknown  its right there on the map if you go to find it  perhaps the op have be there before which be why she want to do over night camping  
rizks  be to those place already  need to try something new   tahsinmim  be there too    smoke  first time   but friend have be there twice already so we want this time to do overnight camping   
i ve do overnight at the sailine a few time already  it s wonderful  i do n t see why anywhere else would be bad  if you re in a group  you should be ok  pack a rape whistle in case of coyote lol  
hello there  a i do live in dukhan for quite long time  i do n t recommend you camp at um bab beach  nothing serious about it but normally people do n t camp there  plus safety wise your gon na be far away from dukhan if you need assistance not good location too i guess around there to camp  but just want to let you know since you ve ask  you could try far down dukhans beach after the beach house  after the qp sailing club  if you know what i mean good clean spot you could always find  anyways good luck mate have fun

qatar living lounge dog owner in doha  what be your favourite walk spot  i know an off leash area where we could play fetch would be too much to ask  would it    but where do all you dog owner like to walk your dog  are there beach nearby where we could toss her in the water to cool off  thanks  
al wakrah beach appear to be popular  far a field  any quiet beach area  
qwerty  thanks  have you see other dog be walk there  how do the local and others react  sounds like a good idea for a friday morning jaunt  
vw  yes  i have see many people with dog on the beach  however  steer clear of local especially if they have child with them  
no worry  i respect others  space and a such i have have no issue so far  as long a other dog have be on that beach all be well  we be responsible and clean up after our dog too  of course  thanks again qwerty  much appreciate  
never off the leash  but along najma be a nice stretch of grass  http  www xanga com home aspx  user bbetz  nextdate 2  2f15  2f2006 23  3a59  3a59 999 
bbetzinqatar  xanga be offline right now  but i assume you mean najma past the mall roundabout  it s a bit too busy there i think  ok for people but not for an overly friendly dog  op 
yes  that s where i m talk about vw  i do n t take our dog off the leash  so it s not a problem for me that the roadway be busy  he really like that stretch of grass  since the only real greenery he usually see be desert shrub   i sometimes have to keep him on a short leash if anyone be out jog or walk  but it do n t seem like the area be frequent very much by others most of the time that i ve be out there  
cool  thanks  it s a great spot indeed  just that every time i ve drive by there s be lot of pedestrian traffic  cheers  
well i usually walk my dog near the gulf cinema n walk like 2 km from there  i do n t usually find people walk there so it s good for my dog coz shez scar of people specially kidz   i use to go to corniche almost everyday to walk my dog  if u go at like 3 be on normal dayz you would n t find alot of people walk  but if u go there on a friday night you ll find it hard a all the kidz and people will be walk next to you or behind you  last thursday it be really quite there  usually there be lot of people on thursday and fridayz   but other non holiday dayz you would n t find alot of people  
on our foreign ministry s site i read that it be absolutely forbidden to bring rottweilers  dobermann and boxer dog  would be a pity so i d have to leave my believe rottweiler kelly with my parent  does anybody have a clue why this be so  because they be consider dangerous  i mean a pit bull would be more dangerous then those three race   yes i know  any dog can be dangerous in the wrong hand  even a yorkshire  though there would be little reason to fear him    where would you buy dog in qatar  i mean  if i d have to leave kelly at home  i d love to have some dog around to keep me company if there be no woman who d volunteer for the job  gg  rene           think different

minimum be qr 2000  for a good car  cheap rental car be all crap and dangerous  
for a somewhat basic car  try petra rent a car on 4413 0404  
i just rent a 2012 kia picanto for a couple of day while my car be be service  i pay 80 per day and the car be by no mean dangerous  it pull away quickly and i feel very safe in it  do n t always think big be well

i agree with giasi  i own a nissan in dubai and it be a pleasure to own it  however the dealership and service of nissan in qatar be horrible  they dont service the car at all just do oil and filter change all the time  ask them for service and they will talk of a schedule of leaving the car there for few days  usually 3 days   if you have the misfortune of a dent on your car it will take a week for them to repair it  why sell cars if you cant service them   nissan cars are really good but the dealership at qatar be a living shame

opportunities car price estimate  where can i find a car dealing who would provide me with a price estimate for 2011 toyota rav4  i need to know the value of a car and have an official estimate for it  how much would this service cost  
go to various car sale website in qatar and dubai  check the model you want and it will give you a fair idea  try www qatarsale com for starters  
thanks but i already have the car  i just need to know how much it worth and have a document that prove it  any recommend dealer  
 even if you bring your car to the technical inspection and it pass  it do n t mean that your car be okay  you can not claim anything if you have an accident due to a technical issue  you can go to a car center and have them measure vital engine data  but even that be not   official     
i think he want to have a document officially value the car  perhaps for insurance purposes  
no i need to know the value of the car  not if it s fit to drive or technical inspection  this do not work  
yes  exactly 
there be some company in europe that compare your car to others in the market and develop an estimate  but i doubt that there be any such thing in qatar  
2011 rav4 would be around 95k to 105k in option 2  similarly add 10 to 15k if u be go to buy option1 
 can you make that   official    deal   
so a car you buy one day 118k  would sell 105k second hand the next day  wow  i just need an official paper state this  
qatar living lounge renault duster 2013  please advice is there anybody use renault duster  if yes then please share the experience about that  i mean about the performance  maintenance cost  
it s good french car  but no resale in doha 
thank you  do you have any idea about the maintenane cost compare to toyota and nissan 
i saw a full review of it  it also call a dacia duster in europe  on a popular motoring program and they be very impressed with it robustness and reliability it have serious off road capability and be practical around town too  the car itself be good but i m not sure if it would have good resale value here  but if resale be n t an issue  and you like the car  then go for it by all mean  you can search for dacia duster fifth gear  on youtube if you d like to see the review yourself  best of luck    
thank you mohdata do you have any idea about it s maintenance cost compare to nissan  toyota 
well i do n t have any idea about renault cost  but what i can tell you with full belief and accuracy be that nothing come close to the reliability and low maintenance cost of japanese car  especially toyota  they just keep go on and on and on  and if you stick to the basic recommended maintenance schedule  toyota could run forever haha i saw a toyota camry few day back which have be driven 798000 kms that be absolutely and unbelievably high mileage and the car be ten year old i could not believe how smooth and quiet it was all the owner do be take good care of the engine and change oil regularly because he drive a lot if maintenance and cost and reliability be a concern for you  then japanese car be the way to go  best of luck    
peace be upon you  and how do you do   first of all  when you live in any arabian gulf country  and think to buy a car  then it be well to buy a japanese car a first choice  however  if you be still new in here and just start work and want to invest your money in a car  then buy a small japanese sedan saloon car  a it could save you a lot of money more than any other european car  specailly here in the arabian gulf  a there be not much of experienced good workshop to make maintinane and fix your european car in the future  so either you go to mitsubishi car or toyota  but nissan be the last choice a i hear that their workshop be very busy and cost more money  so do renault which could cost you much more than nissan  nevertheless  no one be go to push you away from the car that you would love to buy  but a an advice from a person who have be live in qatar for 35 year and have and experince with many type of car  then it be well for you to think more   
thank you so much redan for share your experience and advice  
thank you so much redan for share your experience and advice  
thank you so much mohdata 
i dont know much about renault duster here but i hear it be well accept in india  it be suppose to be the cheap suv  redan  are you work for any japanes car companies here

20  000 qr to fix the ac

i have an oil leak they give me an estimate of 15k  get it fix outside for 500 riyal  
the labour alone will cost 5  000qar   any suggestion out there where to take it   please 
www qatarliving com node 4858391 try these guy

very sorry to hear that  why dont you consult with a guy in interflora  they can advise you how to take care of plant in winter  
   only in dreams never in reality   diane  my plant be very healthy before and i leave for vacation i come back and my plant not in good condition  accord to my mate she water it every night because she be think it be summer  atleast they leave longer but december 07  winter  the plant leave turned black  i think it time to buy new batch of young plant    
why do n t you use what be leave to make an exotic salad   is the air con blow on them  
i want to know what be turn them black  inspite of all the care  
most house plant need water only once a week 
the same be happen to my plant then a friend say not to spoil them  just a chuparustom says water only once a week or even less  they be still hang in there now i may be blonde but i be wise smile lot laugh more 
 i get plant lot of plant  the black thing be lack of sufficient sun  too much water and wrong fertilizer  or bad to come fungus  the red pope of qatar living but a muhammad ali once say  it s not bragging  if you can back it up      
make sure you do n t use to small or too large a pot for your house plant  i have keep plant in their same container for 10 year and they be fine depends on the plant  also you mention manure  you do n t use manure on indoor plant  i hope you meant soil  i also use a liquid fertilizer once in a while and i save water bottle and fill with water and leave for my house plant that way the chlorine go out and the temp be room temperature when you water once a week  sometimes the plant you get here be not good quality when you buy them so it do n t take much to kill them  i have gardenias in the house and within a few month they have outgrow the pot  root bound so i plant them outside in a big pot and they be great now  there be a garden club here you can join and get help and then you will know what plant be easy to grow  like the spider plant clean your air so it good to have a a house plant  
working in qatar best and fast grow business in qatar  hi guy just want you to talk about the best and fast grow business in qatar now adays with a small amout on cash  if you want to start a business what would you do with 500  000 qr  business be a combination of war and sport  
 construction              be like a flower  which give off it s fragrance even to the hand that crus  
just invest in real estate thats the only business where u can become rich over night in this country       smoke     
landscaping and make garden for the rich arabs in qatar  seems to be very lucrative aunt polly 
really  you dont say  man who know gardening could be so profitable runs to get his spade and stinky manure      smoke     
yes it be the only problem be that most of the gardner be not gardner and ca n t tell a strawberry from a peach and have no idea about raise plant  
   manpower company    spend my day look for ever cheap source of under trained  over exploited labour   
fastest grow business be real estate   with 500  000  you can double this amount within 1 yr time  you have to be sharp enought to run the business  img nid 53652 title desc link none align center width height 0  
my point over many thread  manpower companies  great garbage   to expensive and no knowledge  no experience and do n t know a flower from an as  sorry  
but you need lot of hard work and international contact and also lot of legal procedure if bring worker from outside qatar   only experienced people can handle such business or if you have work for a mp company and gain experience then still it s ok but for a new person i will not suggest   img nid 53652 title desc link none align center width height 0  
 then  if moral be no issue   and we be discuss quick return in business  so i assume moral be a minor consideration  i d have to say prostitution  i mean the   companion   or   escort   business  seems to be thrive from what i can see at the ramada and that place that use to be beside the marriott  sure i could expect more than a 15  return on my investment  sure that some with   manpower   contact would be great partner in this business       
family life in qatar what be homoglobin  please anone explain me regading homoglobin bcz doctor tell me your homoglobin be low  thanks 
hemoglobin be the protein molecule in red blood cell that carry oxygen from the lung to the body s tissue and return carbon dioxide from the tissue to the lung  the iron contain in hemoglobin be responsible for the red color of blood  you should eat alot of green vegitables and salad  your hb will come up dont worry  
heamoglobin be a component of the blood  if you be deficient in it  it mean that if you have an accident or cut yourself  you will bleed easy and for a long period of time  
homoglobin be a prejudice against globin    its actually haemoglobin  a deficiency can be due to many factor  if you be deficient you be know a be anaemic  google it for more detail   
overlook  can i say your information be incorrect if one be anaemic and cuts  oneself bleed will not last longer  these be clot factor that be responsible for this not haemoglobin   
my mistake  confuse this with the condition haemophilia  
hi  i be sure most of the guyz answer your query  if you need more detail  read the follwoing  the role of the red blood cell be to carry oxygen through the body  the red blood cell can perform this task because of the presence of hemoglobin  the pigment that be form when the red blood cell develop in the bone marrow  each hemoglobin molecule be make up of a protein molecule call globin and four pigment molecule of a compound call heme  each heme molecule have one atom of iron  and there be four heme molecule in a single molecule of hemoglobin  hence  a single molecule of hemoglobin have four atom of iron  this structure make it possible for one hemoglobin molecule to join with four oxygen molecule to form a substance call oxyhemoglobin  this reaction be reversible  enable hemoglobin to pick up oxygen when the blood be in the lung and to release oxygen in the cell when the blood be pump to the tissue  in general  the blood of men usually have a great concent   
 hemoglobin be a protein that be carry by red cell  it pick up oxygen in the lung and delivers it to the peripheral tissue to maintain the viability of cell  hemoglobin be make from two similar protein that   stick together    both protein must be present for the hemoglobin to pick up and release oxygen normally  one of the component proteins be call alpha  the other be beta  before birth  the beta protein be not express  a hemoglobin protein find only during fetal development  call gamma  substitute up until birth   
hemoglobin be the protein molecule in red blood cell that carry oxygen from the lung to heart and to continue the inhaling and exhaling proccess  they be responsible of healing any kind of cut  they stop the blood flow and they be also reponsible to open any kind of plaque inside vains to prevent heart attack  if you smoke hemoglobin will carry the necotin every where it go because necotine get stick on the hemoglobin and reduce it function so the hemoglobin wont be hold much oxygen in every breathing proccess thats why we see people who smoke breathes more than natural people when they do any activity  there body need oxygen but the hemo  aint functioning in the way they have to  
 hemoglabin be one of spideman s enemy  oh i think that s greengoblin  just kid  definition of hemoglabin hem   o glo   bin     n   hemo   globe    physiol   the normal coloring matter of the red blood corpuscle of vertebrate animal  it be compose of hematin and globulin  and be also call h matoglobulin  in arterial blood  it be always combine with oxygen  and be then call oxyhemoglobin  it crystallize under different form from different animal  and when crystallize  be call h matocrystallin   
wow good to know we have so many qlers with good medical knowledge  its a silly question though  if he can post the question here  surely he can use google or wikipedia to find out what haemoglobin mean

i understand  the bottled water which be meant for drinking be essentially desalinate through distillation and then process with some mineral salt  non drinking water could be a mix of ro  distil and recycle waste water  in this there could be chance of chemical  in very low concentations  which be mean to act a lubricant and anti corrosion agent during reverse osmosis since these additive be not remove fully by the semi permeable membrane  i do n t know if consumption of these chemical could be detrimental to health in the long run  expert opinion be require

qatari culture qatari wedding we have be invite to a qatari wedding this thursday  and apart from not know anyone  a my husband will be on the men s party and i will be at the woman s party  to state the obvious   i have no idea what to expect and what the custom be  what should i wear  do we bring a gift  what happen during a wedding  i be very honor to have be invite but terrify of make a fool of my self  
qatari wedding  gents section  there sure will be two diff section one each for lady and gent  the practice be to greet the groom and his family elder first  then be seat in the hall  red tea arabic coffee will be served will be call for the buffet dinner have dinner and say good bye and thanks to the groom n the family member and leave  ladies  not sure about the custom  dg  amensia might help  ps  be sure not to use mobile camera phone  
qatari weddings be fun  i have be to 23 wedding on my last count  i love it  it s an amazing culture  try and take a friend with you  and be prepare to dance  just kidding  you will not be allow to take your phone  and be prepare to eat lot of nice food  have fun  
do n t take a gift  and dress like you would if you be go to a wedding back home  the lady all look lovely and spend a lot of time do their makeup and wear nice dress  
i know a girl who go to a qatari wedding  she say it get heat because apparently a lot of them turn up with the same outfit on  very embarassing  
qatari wedding     first of all be confident bc no one notice you so do n t be embarress    dress up just like your own style  no one can bother that what you wear    do n t take a snap with your mobile or camera  be carefull      enjoy with buffet     if you be try to escape from a borring party then pls take a friend with you   
i think it be a bit boring  beautiful decoration  heard they cost 60  000qr   table  lot of sweet  however it get started very very late  left at11 00pm  dinner have not start  out of 300 woman in the room i only saw i dress that i like  most be garish and hideously gaudy  lots of bright bright color  feather  sequin  etc  tons of makeup on  they have a runway and a couple of woman play the drum and wail arabic song rather loudly  girls would get up and dance down the runway  so the old woman could check them out a possible daugher in law contender i ve be tell  finally the light go down about 10 00 the fog and light show start  sort of like a rock concert  the bride then come out and walk very slowly down the runway  eventually people come up and shower her head with money  she look scared to death  i learn she be 20 year old and have never meet her husband to be  but have talk to him on the   
so if i have get it right then i should  be prepare for late dinner ie  eat before i go  dress as ghoulish a i can  not take any photo  piece of cake  look forward to the cultural experience 
from my experience  no matter how flamboyantly u dress up  it nothing compare to the qatari lady there  god  they r all so gorgeous  and their way of dress up be amazing  cant afford  lol     abt the gift  no u dont take a gift to the wedding  usually i visit them few day after the wedding  n give a gift  wat happen during a weddin  well  make sure u sit away from the loudspeaker place at all corner of the hall     u can dance if u want  to the arabic song be play there  hhhmmm   n the food part  it yummy  u can starve for a few day after that to lose all those calorie earn on that one evenin    it fun  enjoy   ps  oh yeah  like many others mention above  dont click any snap  n thats if ever they let u carry ur mobile phone inside  usually they hold it at the entrance  so be prepare to be disconnect from the rest of the world for the few hour u spend there  
oh yeah  late dinner  depend on the arrival time of the bride n the groom  n by the way  the lady get a chance to peep at the groom while he escort the bride to the hall  unlike the men on the other side  who cant see who their friend colleague be gettin married to   
unfortunately  i have find qatari wedding to be a bit depress  i have yet to see it a a joyous occassion  i have be to a few in the last few month  and have be very disappointed  the lady seem to be compete with each other in the dress department  and so some outfit be very outlandish  there seem to be so much politics amongs the different group of lady sit at the table  you know  this group do n t like that group  or this part of the family feel snub for some reason   the bride always look terrify and a bit like a geisha girl for all the make  up on her face  i really feel sorry for her  one of the bride i saw  take about 30 min to walk down the isle in front of u a i do n t think she could move with the dress she be wear   and you be right about the mobile thing  i have mine with me in the hall  it have be with me the whole night  i have to answer a phone call  and all of a sudden my phone be snatch out of my   
family life in qatar kiddie party venue aside from fastfood restaurant does anyone know of venue for a kiddie party  mcdo  kfc be already give  how about a restaurant or a place where we can rent  have the food cater  
if you live on a compound do it have facility you can use  if you do n t live on a compound some of them rent the facility out  i know ghanim gardens use to  if you have a friend that live on a compound maybe they could help 
would you like to have kiddie party cater by fast food plus enjoy a free kiddy ride  that would be great and fun  
they have a party area at jungle zone which be very good  kid can play on the ride and then there be a magic show arrange if you book the party hall  you have to arrange the food from outside so can arrange any good catering to do so  
you can also check the water park on the ground floor of city center   verynice place to entertain the kiddoes   food can b order from any of the joint above   
i also endorse jungle zone  otherwise you have burger king  dairy queen   you ca n t mean what you say unless you can say what you mean  
looks like it be a really long time since you have be to the city center  be it  the waterpark be no more there  in place be a toyota car showroom  and i really doubt whether toyota be in a mood to give that showroom for kiddy to start break glass et all  lol  anyways  other than the compund club halls  you could try one of those hotel ballroom  and if not that big then just yesterday at the royal plaza i remember see something relate to another water themepark  you could check that out  cheers  
 at landmark or villagio do kid party a well  a fraction healthier and they get to make their own pizza  must stop say bizza  haha  
do nt know that    thing really change here in qatar   very fast  
most of the play area  jungle zone  extreme world  rays reef  will do party and i think you can specify food arrangement although most use the ff outlet  other than that  hotel will let you use function room to have party  some will also source mini disco etc  try also dana club  diplomatic club etc  depending on how large your party be  other idea include  picnic  trip to the zoo  ice skating  old kid  although you be provide the supervision and entertainment  hope this help  
thanks so much for the input  be rays reef the one in royal plaza  is it already open  grantley  have you try one of the party at pizza express  do they provide the entertainment as well

moving to qatar ras laffan hi  if you be to work in ras laffan  do you live there  too  are there housing accomodations in the rl industrial area  if i look at a map  the drive between ras laffan and doha look to be 60  minute  is this true  so if you live in ras laffan  what be the entertainment like there  
depends on the company you re work for  they will have their own camp within rlic  with their own entertainment and it s up to them who live there and who commute from doha  it s about an hour and a quarter bus journey from doha

it depend on the company u r work with  mostly all company have their own accomadation camp inside there and they have their own entertainment inside the camp  they will provide transport for the person to go to doha  but mostly they have a shedule for that     my opinion be to 50  50 chance  bcz some can enjoy  some do n t feel   the one main thing if u need to save money  this be the best place  bcz here no way to spend much money  so u can save   if ur target be on that    
yes  save money be the priority  but i be just wonder what a person do around las raffan if he s on single status and he finish work each day  are there some simple restaurant to go to if you do n t want to cook dinner at night  or  be there cafes to walk to just to relax  i m not interested in any heavy disco scene  are there neighborhood in al khor  usually if there be neighborhood  there be small shop and cafe  right  is this what the place be like  thanks for the help  
cook inside there be not possible  all camp have mess hall and from there only u can get food  and for that they have kitchen and have a catering team tooo  but u have to adjust with that food and alll  if u r in good position u will get good room  may be single and if u r go much tope u will have single room with an additional room a a a visitor s longe and have a fridge contain the refreshements u need and there be not possible to wash clothes by urself  u have to give to the camp laundary    it absolutely free    and in camp u have a smalll shop for buy thing  u have a recreational hall have all type of game  and an internet cafe  it free   but u can use maximum one hour one time    u have to adjust ur life there      
ahh  i see  i ve work in oil camp before so i know what you mean about adjust to the life  in other word  there be no way to take a bus or taxi to any small town that be nearby  like al khor  just to get away from the work site for a few hour  sometimes it s good to get into a different scene for a while  is there taxi service outside las raffan  
if you have a car you can drive out of ras laffan  some company provide car for employee to do this  also  the camp accomodation i ve see have internet and cable tv in all the room  and there s a good gym and a swimming pool and a bar  
thanks much  tallg  that info help lot

tcom  those have shower  toilet  garbage can  lifeguard   
the op be ask for life guard  change room and all those thing be not there in any of the public beach  
a big no 
socialising doha be so dry  so boring  discus  be doha one of the most boring place ever  
no  
you would be hard press to find a place less exciting  it bad watching paint dry     
yessssss  
very boring              
it depend on how social you be  nevertheless it can not be deny of some restriction in freedom from clothe to food  the weather be worth commendable a well  from hot hot summer to chill winter inclusive of these frequent sand and dust storm  just live with it  
jeez guy  get off your arse and get a life  i have a very active social life here  get a hobby or two  get out and meet people  join club and society  there s lot to do if you get out and look for it  
most of the place be teem with soggy british expats and they drive me to absolute abstraction    
dry coz it a desert  and no much greenery around if you be look in term of nature  but if call it boring be up to you  you decide how to deal your life here  you want to enjoy you can  also depend on your interest  
 maybe you be the   happy go lucky   kind of guy who love to mingle with people  but to others who just want to unwind or relax themselves alone without spend too much money for the hotels beach resort there s no other place but in your 4 corner of your room which you will really get bore most of the time but in fairness  qatar be just ok  for earn money only   
i come here for the income  i spend most of my free time with something i like to do  but if you be really a adventurer  you have a right to feel it  what to do yani   stay or go  
socialising which be good airline  qatar airways or gulf air   paging airline crews  staffs  which you prefer  qatar airways or gulf air  why you say so  can you write the name of the crew or staff of that airline who give you very good service  what is are your unforgetable bad experience in      
to me qa  try both of them  the quality of service be well in qa  especially long distance flight  if you re look for a problem  you re probably gon na find one  
   only in dreams never in reality   qatar airways  do you happen to know any name of that staff of crew who serve you    what nationality be the best in qatar airways     good morning to you  
   only in dreams never in reality   i like qatar airway  the color or their uniform and the body fit of the satff and crew be really good  i like to look at them  they be neat and clean  
gulf air be the bad   
i like emirates air  etihad airways about qatar airways no comment but kid aside captain  fo of qa be nice  cabin crews hmmmm no comment as well  
retahnam  i fly qa quite often and know lot of cabin crew work there  and ga  i remember once i use it for a flight to beirut  i ask for a blanket got it when we be almost land  after ask for it few time   their plane be old  seat not so comfortable  and i hate to watch egyptian movie on 1 screen  not to mention i do n t speak arabic  p but  surely  there be a price difference  if you re look for a problem  you re probably gon na find one  
 are you kid me    my wife read qatar living too    even if they be to give me the best service and treat me like royalty  i good not remember their initial    i m glad u do n t ask for phone number too    qatar airways have most of the time be on time and new plane  love their new boeing 777   both have good crew although those on qa be on their toe to serve you well least they get fire  the weekend be here  gon na watch   the mist   with my wife  soak up every minute of the weekend     
well  it be very sad to say but qa remind me more of asian airline  than an international one i flu with them 3times for the last 2months and i can say  i do not see anybody else but korean and filipino crew there be nothing wrong about it  i guess finally the managment in qa find the secret how to have employee who be never go to complain about anything  or have opionion what so ever  about the airline  the seat be very small  more seat  more money   also i think they change cater or something  but the food be bad even for an airline food but the crew  they be try to as attendive a possible  poor thing  nobody want to get fire for not give you a cup of water or something   it be sad  
i completely agree with knspet  totally  qatar airway be awful   5 star airline my  rse  only if you re business first class i m sure  cattle class be dreadful  small seats revolting food i be travel with a 2 year old and they be extremely unhelpful although i have to say there be one male cabin crew on that flight i think he be look after business class who be great  awful awful   gulf air etihad and emirates no comparison   
airlines  i have travel by qatar airways  gulf airways  air india  of which i would rate air india above qa  ga  in fact the most comfortable be jet airways  previously it be national carrier now it go international and have flight from doha india doha   i would have to say jet be the best with leather seats  nice leg space  good service et all   jet s service be legendary in india  in qa  ga both  my knee be continously touch the front seat  be very uncomfortable  it felt almost a if i be travel in a bus  lol sevice wise i guess all be as good  qa with filipino staff be good too   but the comfort of the seat and the leg space would be the most prize by me  
family life in qatar texas a m rejects student a student with straight a s or a  s from grade 9 to grade 12  a sat result above 1650  and a toefl result above 108 be reject without cause by texas a m university in qatar  does anybody know what they be look for  einsteins  geniuses  or do they have other selection  criterion  
maybe they have n t hit their quota of local student   motherhood  the hard job you ll ever love    
well it their prerogative and i m sure they have their reason  i wonder why though  
 whatever reason they may have  it s unjust to reject such an intelligent student    clarification can go a long way    
 i agree with alexa  there s too much that s unknown  in the end  like everyone else  they want to make money  they re not go to reject a pay customer because they re evil or   unjust     
 texas a  m have pretty odd requirement a compare to others  last time when i apply  get reject  they ask me bring reference  letter from two professional people who know me  what you can do be call the registration office  ask them the reason why  colleges  universities always give a reason for rejection  a word of advice  stay away from cnaq  in short cnaq be like a junior stage artist who think he be tom cruise  they teach course without have equipment  first batch of graduate in engineering who   master   cable course never even saw a connector  
if the entrance requirement be anything like uk university  then it s not just about grade and qualification  
   without cause    they do n t need cause  it s very competitive and it s not just about grade  and it s not possible to answer your question without compare to all the other applicant   
thanks for your post  he decide to go to australia  
 some us university have very stringent requirement  this application may be one of several hundred reject just because they have fill all available space in a particular program  have the various certificates degrees present be attest  many western university look very carefully at degrees certificates from outside north america and even europe because there be a significant number of forgery  not say that this be the case here   the problem in this application be probably that they do n t apply in time and so be not on the first pick list  signature line    you ca n t fix stupid    
that s too bad  i hate to see bright kid get disappointed and discourage  mandi

family life in qatar homeschooling who homeschools their kid in doha  what textbooks do you use  how young do you start  i want to start homeschooling dd  darling daughter   she s 3 years old  does anyone homeschool at 3  what book do you use  are there place to buy book in doha  any reliable series purchase online  
plenty of nurseries r there  
i do n t have great feeling about homeschooling  however it s get increasingly difficult and expensive to get the child into a good school in qatar  try this website www dohahomeschoolers blogspot com or call darla on 4881797 
hi canary  have you ever see timelife book for child  it s a set of book in different category  geography  math  science  etc    an agent once come to my house to show me sample  i be suppose to purchase one but be busy house hunting and moving  i ll look for the contact detail and will let you know

 joan  did you find the timelife contact  might it be available online  butterfly  i try www dohahomeschoolers blogspot com and i only get a page title   pool party invitations    is that the way to go  start homeschooling by have a pool party and pool your idea   
yes i ve just check that website and it s obviously not work  i get it from the marhaba summer 07 edition  where you can find an article about homeschoolers in qatar  in the education section  i think if be a good starting point  since there seemst to be an organised group with membership for parent who teach curriucula full time at home  on the other hand  your daughter be only three and from my experience  a a nursery teacher  at this age you should foucus on language development  not sure how many language you teach to your child  but it get more difficult if you be exponsing your child to two or three different language   abc s and letter recognicion include read small word and recongnising her own name in writting  counting and number recognition  colour  shape art and craft and pencil control for trace line  number and letter  i find really good material about the jolly phonics in the learning centre  top floor city center  also  there be good excer   
we will be move to doha in the early spring  i ve homeschooled my child  now 10 and 12  their entire life  so i ve do pretty extensive research on homeschooling there  there be a yahoo group for homeschoolers in doha  http  groups yahoo com group dohahomeeducators  you could start with some basic info there  it s a pretty flexible group that meet whenever some member decides to set something up  just about homeschooling in general  3 be very young to begin formal schooling  i think i would focus on let your child explore the world and read lot of good book to her  but if you be determine  here s a good resource for young kid  http  www fiarhq com b4fiveinarow html if you have any other question  feel free to ask  homeschooling have be a great experience for u  my husband s company have offer to pay for their tuition to a private school in doha  but we be opt to continue homeschooling because it have be such a positive thing  
 i look at before five in a row on their website but could n t see any actual page example or other info  there be only reference  etc  where could i see physical copy of the book or digital example page  does any people in this homeschooling yahoo group have copy of any five in a row book  i apply to join this book but be wait for approval  it say   for homeschooling mom   but i hope they stretch that that to include   homeschooling dad

i do n t know if this be a very popular option  there be a tutoring place here call cedars and i think some people use this while they be wait for school place  tel 468 8192 email cedarstutoring  hotmail com getting school place be a problem in doha but if you have a british passport  you have a good chance than some because you will be give priority in the british curriculum school  i m sure you ve probably research which one be popular here  any that come under the umbrella of bsme  british schools of the middle east  and be not for profit be generally sound  they have a website www bsme org uk obviously the best option would be to come over to doha on a look see  visit so that you can check out the school yourself  in any event  if you be look for place to start september 2007  you need to act now a it may take 3  6 month to go through the process of applying entrance test for secondary child etc if have child at secondary and primary level i would

family life in qatar parkhouse school  review hiya  does anyone have any kid in parkhouse school that could give me a real good insight with regard to the teaching standard  etc please  would the kid fit back into the uk system if they be to go back to uk   sometime  lol  any other comment appreciate  thanks  
shityouno  your name say what you be  shityuono  
now that be funny  the user s name be sh tyuono and she can post wildly on ql  when i mention her name it be remove by the mod  wake up guy    
block that  mod remove  yuono  or you make yourself a laugh clown  mod  
a number of my tuition student be from parkhouse  there seem to be little support for those who lag behind in a particular subject  also the number of uk qualify teacher with qts  qualified teacher status  be limited  you may wish to ask how many of the teacher actually have qts compare to those that do n t  many of the teacher be not from the uk and do so not have a background of teach a british curriculum  finally  parkhouse only follow part of the national curriculum of england and wales  the rest of the curriculum be base around what be refer to a the international curriculum  which be create by a private company in the uk and be not endorse by the government  this topic have be discuss a number of time previously so you may wish to do a search to get a good idea of the school  you may also wish to try other uk curriculum school such a doha college  dess  sherborne and the international school of london  good luck  
joe90 not sure how qualify you be to comment on the status of the teacher at park house school  all their teacher comply with sec condition on qualification of their teacher  otherwise they would not be able to operate  i can confirm the vast majority of teacher at the school be british  2nd be south african  excellent standard of educated teacher  and other nationality  the school be as british a it get in a non british country  the standard be extremely high  there be very positive school parent contact and all pupil be expect to work hard  be well discipline  and result focused  i be british and my child attend park house  i would have no problem with them return to the uk  not likely with the current working condition in the uk   and slip into very good school and cop with the change  if you be typical middle class parent who discipline your child and make sure they stay on top of their study you will reap the benefit of this school which   
as a user of the qatari and british education system for my child let me tell you that if you have a good teacher  your child and you be lucky  usually here about 1 in 5 teacher have that power to inspire your child  be glad when you get one  no matter what school they be pay by  education be about inspire child to progress  not about check off what they have study  
craftyqueen  let me tell you that all the child who be not as good in read a the rest of their colleague be take away from their normal class  give to a volunteer parent  who be give a bunch of flashcard with no further instruction  who be suppose to help them develop read skill  not only be that wrong  but on top of it they miss what be happen in their class  and do n t try and tell me it s not true  i be a volunteer parent last schoolyear for year 1  is this the way to save on spending more time with the child who need more reading practice  why not do like the french school  extra hour of tuition after school  last swimming competition the kid be so excited to show what they could do  instead the swimming teacher use her own son to get a good place for park house  the amount of dissapointed face of child be heartbreaking  waiting hour for nothing  things be far less positive then what you make them seem  
alumnar i be surprise you be willing to say negative comment about the school your child attend on ql  maybe you should change school for your kid and give those parent who would remove their right arm to put their kid into park house their place  in the uk all primary school ask parent to come into the low primary class to hear the child read  i ca n t understand what could be good than one to one reading  if you want to suggest a reading group after school which parent fund i be sure the school would be interested in your suggestion  in the uk book be change once a week  here in park house it three time a week  their book be set base on their individual ability into small group if possible  the teacher hear the pupil read at least once a week  parents be ask to participate in their child s learning by listen to their child read at home  schooling be not a vacuum  a child can learn at anytime anywhere  as for fairness  the world be not fair and   
 some of the comment that have be make on this thread be more than a little misleading  for example  be we compare parkhouse  or any other school in doha  with fee paying  independent school in the uk or be we try to compare them with state school in britain  as parkhouse be a fee paying school  i would have think that the former would be a fair point of comparison  one person have write that the standard at parkhouse be   extremely high    well  if there be an acute shortage of school place  then it stand to reason that some of the more popular school can be very selective about who they allow in through the gate  i have not hear much about parkhouse s special educational needs policy and i suspect that they would not want to admit sen child because that might affect their   extremely high standard    that also might explain parkhouse s preference for nice  white english child  craftyqueen have mention the sec  the supreme council of education  this be a    
dear all  some comment be positive  some be negative this be in 2010  now we be in 2012  ccould anyone update his point of view  or share his kid experience a a parent   because i m about to put my two kid there  thanks

qatar living lounge child die in school bus in dps today child return late from school  dps mis   the reason be a child be find dead in the school bus  from what i hear  the child doze off in the bus during her morning trip  the driver do not notice and the child be leave in the bus  they find her in the afternoon  it should have be the heat in the bus that kill her  she be just 4 year old  did anyone hear about this  
what be   dps mis   
better confirm the news before spread this or else this will become a rumor  
yes i hear about that if it true who r the responsible for that  1  all the school management should think about school timing 2 parents should give them enough time to take good sleep in this advanced system we r torture our little angel to be in race 
i think this happen a few year ago  or at least there was such a case a few year ago  
initially wen i call a teacher she deny this  but they confirm this to the newspaper  any school should set guideline  even if a child get a good sleep  it be normal for her to fall asleep in bus  buses come as early a 6 a m  
there be a similar case in abudhabi last year i think   look like this type of incident be not uncommon in this temperature  schools need to be extra cautious with strict law  
there be a similar case in some other gulf country  i think i read about this around a year back 
what        this be irresponsible from school  govt of qatar should take actoin fot bad job shame shame dps kill one child one family  
this news seem true and school have express condolence and a holiday tomorrow  really the school authority need to be more responsible especially when they charge way too much in term of special fee and all when compare to other school in doha  the facility tey lack and the amount of negligence show be too much  there be no conductor in most bus  even the one in which small kid travel  and even after complain to the school many time  there be no action  many bus be hire and be drive by irresponsible driver who dont care about anything  another issue be the school building which have be sooo long under planning and fund raising stage  what be the management of the school do happily run their own business and drain all the money from the parent without give anything back to the school the school management should be hold responsible for the extremely poor porta cabin in which they teach the junior wing and the lack of responsibility in issue r   
how can the supreme education council not see the poor condition in which this so called high profile school be run   
latest qatar labor code my wife be plan to come here in qatar  she want to be familiarize first with labor code of qatar a per requisite in the human resources services  can some body help me to secure a late copy of labor code which be english translation  thanks 
salary and allowances end of service benefits   gratuity   calculation  end of service benefits   gratuity   calculation  dear ql ers  i wish to know how be gratuity calculate in qatar government authority office  the knowledge i have be that  it should be     number of year work  x  last basic salary  date of joined  2001 
it be compute at the last basic salary you re receive  1 month basic salary per year of service up to a maximum of 10 year  hope this help   
for esb calculation  the maximum of 10 year have already be waive mean you can now work without any limitation of number of year  when the go get tough  the tough get go   
basic salary x 12months  365days x total no  of day work  total gratuity  this computation be base on my previous employer  
actually the payment be 3 week for every year work  not a month  the labour law change in 2004  previously there be a sliding scale whereby you get more payment for every year that you work  and the payment be base on full salary not just basic   if you get your hand on the old law you could arugue to your employer that the previous law apply up until january 2005 when the current law be enact  worth a shot  tresgandas your calculation would come out to be the total salary pay  not the eosb amount  
heartless be right  it be only 3 week pay  my company give that to u annually  i guess it be easy for them than give u one lump sum after we terminate our employment  
and it also cheap for them  because they give it at the salary you be make at that time rather than the salary when they pay it at the end of your contract with them  you might have be promote etc  
heartless  that labour law require the eosb to be calculate on the basis of the last wage pay  which mean if you start at qr 100 and be now get pay qr500  your eosb will be on the basis of qr 500  
jb  i be come across this practice of pay eosb at the end of every year for the first time  rather strange  
does the 3 week per year payment stay the same or increase by year  for example  after 5 year would you receive a 3 week gratuity or a 15 week gratuity  if it be the later  how do company or school afford this  
dc jaz  you would receive a 3 week bonus for every year you work  so if you have work 5 year you d get 15 week bonus  this assume the company be pay the bonus at the end of service a they re suppose to  not at the end of each year of service  
salary and allowances after resignation benifits as per qatar law i am working in qatar on last 6 years  my present salary 5000 qr  i would like to resign from my job and settle back to my nativ country  can u please advise me what kind of benefits i can expect according to qatar labor law   is it company can give the gratuity together with monthly salary is it allow by the law here  if i go legal action against company any use   please advise 
qatar labor law be make to protect the interest of expats work in qatar min you can get 21 day vacation per year  21 day gratuity per year of year worked min should be one year of service  
a lot of people get screw on this  remember that although 1 year of work be the minimum period to be able to receive this benefit  you get pay pro rata for any period exceed the first year  include portion of a year  
 you re require to provide 1 month notice before you resign so you call get all your benefit  i think at least 75  of your salary x year of service be your gratuity plus all your vacation leave  etc  im not sure though but most probably it s go to be like that  i have a question my self  it be relate here though i already post it to question  answer but it seem no one be really visit that part of ql so  my company get this habit of delay people from the date of resignation so they obviously know about the two week max limit of qatar labor code s article 57  my question would be  be there a law regard my company be liable or give me a just compensation start from the day i terminate my contract to the day i go back to my home country if they   accidentally   delay me for one or two day up   
every company be liable to give 21 day annual vacation and 21 day indemnity gratuity minimum upon completion of one year  some company to avoid this terminate the staff in 11 month  and others mostly dont pay anything to the ignorant labor and junior staff that they dont get their right  you can approach the human right department and the labor department who help the expat in such case   cupid s  any resignation or termination should serve a month notice except if you be terminate in your probation period  first 6 month usually   also employee who have complete 5 year or more need to serve 2 month notice  the company be liable to pay only the notice period  the pending vacation balance if any and the indemnity calculate on the last earned basic salary  hope this help 
go to labor court 
if those employer do not go by labour court  they can be blacklist  
ishu369  the 1 month notice be for the op for me can my company delay me without them be liable because i already file my resignation  expect to leave on the day i terminate my contract so if they delay me for 3 day be they require to pay me  because some employes in my company be delay for more than two week without get pay though they ve get the say benefit  i do n t want to get stick here for a few day so if they can be hold responsible they ll be force to do their job correctly  if there s any  
very frankly say  do n t think about legal action  it will never work  gratuity per year be of 21 day  so if you do n t take it previously  you will get all your due  try to find a median solution  insha allah everything will be fine 
gratuity be pay  21 day per year which be calculate on your last basic salary  in your case u say that you be work for the last 6 year here in qatar with a gross salary of qr 5000 month  so let u assume your date of joining be january 01  2004 and your basic salary be qr 4000  if so  the calculation be a follow  01 01 2004 to 31 12 2011  21x8  168 days so your gratuity be calculate a  4000x168x12 365  qr 22  093 15 apart from this  your employer should provide a ticket to your home country  the notice period up to 5 five year from the date of joining be 1 month and above that  2 month  in your case the notice period be 2 month  gratuity indemnity be settle net of any staff receivables recoveries  
if the company be issue your ticket then they can delay it till there be a cheap ticket or an affordable price which be common with some company  they pay you only till the last date of your work a per the resignation or cancellation of contract  
working in qatar end of service benefit what be the computation of gratuity or end of service benefits for the working period of 7 year  thanks to confirm   
a per friend tell me computation would be base on basic salary only 
21 day per year 
i think after 5 yrs 1 month computation  
depends on your contract  i believe mine to be 3 week per full year base on basic pay  
accord to the qatar labour law  article 54 in addition to any sum to which the worker be entitle to upon the expiry of his service  the employer shall pay the end of service gratuity to the worker who have complete employment of one year or more  this gratuity shall be agree upon by the two party  provide that it be not less than a three week wage for every year of employment  the worker shall be entitle to gratuity for the fraction of the year in proportion to the duration of employment  the worker s service shall be consider continuous if it be terminate in case other than those stipulate in article  61  of this law and be return to service within two month of it termination  the last basic wage shall be the base for the calculation of the gratuity  the employer be entitle to deduct from the service gratuity the amount due to him by the worker  
service gratuity be grant minimum of 1 year continuous service in the company  the computation be like  gratuity last basic salary x 70   this be 21 day  x length of service in year 
example  last basic salary  qr10  000 length of service  5 year  10000 x 0 70  x 5  qr 35000 note  21 day or 70  be minimum requirement from labour law  if your company give you more than that then it very good  
yep  that s the law  now  go and fight for it  because the law be one thing  and reality be the other thing  
1  last basic salary  multiply  by 12 month  year  and  divide  by 365  day in year    x 2  years of service  multiply  by agreed gratuity  day in a year   y 3  x  multiply  by y  z  total gratuity to be pay  sample  last basic salary  10  000 x 12  month   365  day in year   328 76  average daily salary  5  year of service  x 21  agree gratuity   105  day  105 x 328 76  34  519 80  your esb from employer  
example  last basic salary  qr10  000 length of service  7 year  10000 x 0 70  x 5  qr 35000 note  21 day or 70  be minimum requirement from labour law for 1st 5year  after 5year continuous service employee be entitle to get gratuity minimum 30 day each year service put in after that period  mean first 5year employee be entitle three week of basic salary each year  after 5year it will be 30days each year   10000 x 1 00  x 2  qr 20000 total 7 year 55000 qr

qatari culture why be n t people respect qatar  i notice many people do not respect local qataries or they do not respect the country  they come here without have an idea about our culture and religion  all they think about be how much salary they will take  we a a qataries feel worried about the thousand of outlandish people and we try to be open with others but if they respect our culture and our land  what do u think   
thats not true  who tell you that  i m work here so i respect qatar  team applei ph for your iphone need   p 
there r ppl who dont respect i agree  but dont u know there be also people who r not qataris but love qatar as much a u do  ramadan on it way      
there may be some but i know most of the people reside here specially those who bring their family certainly love qatar  
we all love qatar  kuluna qatar   ramadan on it way      
some of foreign ppl not respct country by do thing against culture and religion like drink outside  wear bad clothes  short  naked   and so on 
huyenqatar    im not agree you the only important thing be salary  before i go to any country i have to read and know about ppl there    also it good if i try to make a friendship and relationship with local    but i notice from some off ppl silly idea  they look on the empty of cup and think they be all foolhardy   do u think foreign ppl come to qatar to be guard and police and that s why i can sleep in peace every nite  looool    i dont know what the relationship between the respect and sleeping at nite  
thanks for all who put lovely messges  qatar love who love her   and we a a local welcome any body from anywhere  
this forum be one of chanel for healthy discussion but i think also forigen have to learn arabic and be more share in the public society  we all love money local and foreign but in same time we have to have a way to help others without wait    
if the western ppl proud that they be more civilization than qataries or other why we dont see any effect from them  they only come to have a    and leave   be that the only thing what we r look in our life  
designer  i dont see why peopleh ave to speak arabic  tbh  i speak arabic and english and i find it hard communicate in public in general  because most speak netiher  esp in shop etc  personally i think we should learn to speak tag a long  actually i find expat be very respectful of qatari culture  you might get a few that arent but you wil also get a few from qatari culture that arent respectful  it normal

economic issue  tax and benefit   but do n t know for sure  i think if everyone agree and they can support themselves  they should n t be penalize  but i do think that child be make the unwitting partner in these situation and it can be very  very hard on them  they do n t actually get to consent and the choice be make for them  i do n t think the west be scar at all about polygamy  they simply do n t approve of it in their society  it s their right  be n t it  please note  prostitution be not legalize in the us  except in one strange county in nevada that i have never understand  nor be same sex marriage  except in a very few case  i refuse to drink the kool aid   pm 
 have any of you see the series big love  its about us polygamist in utah    ali baba and 40 thief   be now   ali baba and 30 thief    10 be lay off   
it s so funny how it work on some level but be disastrous on others    i refuse to drink the kool aid   pm 
why be drink alcohol consider a crime in the middle east  crime in what sense  what if the drinker agree  and be cheat on your beer having a permanent vodka besides her consider an equally serious crime  and why  why be alcohol prohibit  while smoke and underage marriage be be legalize  it be say that even in some christian country  alcohol be limit  so why be the middle east so scar about it  what s good for the goose be good for the gander  do n t question our law and we wo n t question yours

 afford 1 wife  let alone two        if you do n t like the heat  get out of the kitchen  but stop try to fan the flame before you leave  it will burn you on the a  a you go through the doorway     me visit www qaws org  
follows some rule from the bible and we be allow under christian catholic church to marry only one woman man  pretty same a the islamic rule i think  the venezuelan sensation    
good question the  interesting to see a common question address to people in this region turn on it s head and ask the other way round  ca n t say i have an answer though  will be interested to read other s response though  
it s not only in the west but also on some country in the east that polygamy  bigamy be outlaw  the reason be simple  it be illegal in the new testament  bible   i m not sure what s the reason for buddhist country like thailand  singapore to adopt monogamy though  for muslim country like malaysia and indonesia  it be common for muslim there to marry only one  cultural convention  maybe  in my country  adultery  concubinage be a serious crime  but it be a crime that be so hard to find evidence of    usapa na  
polygamy be not a crime  you just can not be marry to multiple individual which have become a standard that derive from judaism christian value  as time progress and the consequence form multiple partner slowly reveal itself  std s hiv and such  we can conclude that this have be the right approach  unfortunately the popularity of couples  club  where couple seek another couple for sexual purpose be become more and more popular  prostitution in some country be legal  some not  as go for me government should legalize prostitution and register all that practice  create labor union and tax them over their income  why  this cut the throat of crime  repress human trafficking and serve a purpose in society  the same go for soft drugs

qatar living lounge scientology in qatar i be very surprised to see scientology  try to get convert in qatar this belief system be ban in some country such a germany  i think  and the founder openly ridicule islam  http  www youtube com watch  v zbt6bqi 1bw the founder s book be available at the book fair  near the awqaf  ministry of islam  stand  at the front entrance  so if you be offend by the danish cartoon   this be much bad and these people be here with their book  
be it tom cruise sell the book       i m jack s complete lack of surprise 
the organizer of the book fair probably dont even know what scientology be  
 same thing last year  i be very surprised to see they be just about the only representative in the   american   area last year  very strange  i guess they go where the money be   be kind than necessary  for everyone you meet be fight some kind of battle   
a  it illegal b  ron l hubbard have make more joke about the prophet  pbuh  than any danish person so why do no one care  
not too many people know about ron l  hubbard  not too many people can make the connection between him and scientology  for majority mr   mrs  tom cruise be all there be to scientology  personally i feel that guy be an idiot and hubbard s book should n t have find their way in an islamic country   aal izz well  
point take  but big hooo haa recently in the press about some stuff say on ql which be trivial compare to man who have openly belittle islam  it just seem all very unbalanced to me   
once you put it in that context  it do seem very very strange  pm s thread be really insignificant and trivial compare to what this guy talk about   aal izz well  
thanks whyte knight i actually detest him because he be a racist who help justify apartheid in south africa   
yes ofcourse  i remember him once praise hendrick verwoed  hubbard be one mess up mind for sure   aal izz well  
 well oryx  thanks for update u  but really this scientology should be ban in qatar and how come it reach here  is there no check and balance system here in qatar  i agree with samyauk  the organizer of the book fair probably dont even know what scientology be  and pwb78  i guess they go where the money be  weird    pour vivre heureux  vivons cach

politics crescent moon symbol questions  what be the islam meaning of the crescent moon symbol  the christians have the cross  the jews have the star of david  and the muslims have the crescent moon  right  what be the history behind the crescent moon symbol  what do it symbolize or mean  is it a valid symbol for the faith of islam  
it appear 2300 bc on akkadian seal  
is it a valid symbol for the faith of islam

bitteschoen  drac  
get adopt  their meaning change accord to use  but for the good part of the last millenium it have denote allegiance to islamic faith and feature prominently on flag and coat of arm  it s original invention and usage have nothing to do with islam however  
wait for another answer   
 the crescent be not a symbol use for islam by muhammad or any other early muslim ruler  a the islamic religion be against appoint   holy symbols    so that during the early century of islam  muslim authority simply do n t want any geometric symbol to be use to symbolize islam  in the way that the cross symbolize christianity  the menorah be a commonly occurring symbol of judaism  etc    this be why early islamic coin be cover with arabic write  but contain no visual symbol   
people of the moon and have be use it a a symbol for thousand of year     
   the star and crescent signifies concentration  openness and victory  as well a sovereignty and divinity  according to tradition  in 339 bc a brilliant waxing moon save byzantium  now istanbul  from attack by philip of macedon  to mark their gratitude  the citizen adopt the crescent of diana a the city s emblem  when the city become the christian constantinople in 330 ad  it crescent assume the significance of an attribute of the virgin mary  in 1299  conquer what be now turkey  sultan osman have a vision of a crescent moon stretch over the world  it thus become a symbol of the ottoman dynasty  and when constantinople fell to muhammad ii in 1453  the crescent come to represent both islam and the turkish empire  the star be add by sultan selim iii in 1793  it five point be establish in 1844     source    signs  symbols  page 42  by clare gibson

qatari culture to wear a burqa or not  my family and i be new here  i pack lightly for my stay  with the intent to purchase a burqa for my outing  out of respect for the culture  however  i be surprised to find so many woman not wear them  is there a need as long a i be dressed conservatively  or be those not wear them be disrespectful and simply tolerate  
hi go a per what your mind say  
welcome to qatar  if you feel this be decent dress and more safer  you can wear  either muslim or not if you wear this dress  you will be respect  
i m shocked  you say you re already here  you do n t realise yet that qatar  sorrily  be a step away from dubai  or may be egypt  where you seldomly meet a woman with niqab  burqa  it s worthy to express gratitude for respect the land tradition  
not wear the burqa do not mean that we be be disrespectful  
wear anything that you feel comfortable but follow the qatar dress code  
lol  ca n t resist laugh at certain people s ignorance of the rest of the world  ps  by the way  in canada  not everybody live in an igloo   
you must wear a burqa always  
 tinkerbell  you say    if u r not a muslim u need not wear a burka   does this mean that muslimas need to wear a burka or hijab in qatar  during my short visit i get the impression that muslim or not  it s each individual s decision  or sometimes her family s or community s decision  and if no veil be choose  whether for the hair alone hijab or hair and face burka niqab  that modest dress be ok   
i know a muslim who do n t wear one  
happy horizons  you re absolutely correct  i ve never saw a burqa in qatar

qatar living lounge al million taxi service had anyone take ride with karwa s new franchise taxi operate by al milllion  i have yet to take a rdie in one of these new franchise taxi  so i do n t know about their service  are the driver well behave than those from karwa or mowasalat  wonder whether mowasalat have make any effort to oversee complaint regard al million in order to further enhance the quality of service  any comment  
the problem with these new taxi be they be not that familiar with the road of qatar  i get one of them but wasnt able to ride just because the driver didnt know the way  so do i  
there meter do not stop while in trafic unlike karwa which will stop and triple it speed once it s off trafic that lead to high bill payment  
i ve try al million taxi so far it be a good experience  the taxi be on time  there be a text from them prior to the agreed time and the name of the driver with the plate  the meter be on and the destination be plot in their metering machine  but yes since the driver be new he was nt familiar with where i be go so i have to tell the direction  other than that i have no problem with get a taxi from them  
better service than regular karwa  driver be well behave  much better only hing they just need some time to get familiar with all the route in the city rest all be good  
i want to talk about this topic anyway  yesterday i take a million cab from lulu to just two signal away  near falcon petrol station   he did nt know where mall round about be  he did nt know how to change lane  the lady behind honk like hell and show her sour face through the window  somehow i manage to reach my house i feel pity for these driver a they be very new to this place and desperate to make a living  hope it go well after sometime without too many casualities  the taxi be new and clean  the driver be courteous and very obliging he only take 10 riyals  where karawa guy take 12  15 riyals  i welcome million taxi  with all it fault  doha really need a competitor for karwa  
give it a try and give it a chance  they be like new kid on the block  
looks like these taxi driver be not train properly before allow them to drive around the city  did n t know how to change lane   how be they able to acquire driver s license then  
we have try this new taxi recently  a mention above  they be polite than the old karwa driver  they show their respect to costumer not like the old karwa taxi driver which be arrogant and this new million taxi  they be not choose their costumer  they charge u an extra 4riyals because they have two meter run  one be always 4 riyal and the other one start at 4 riyal  this be way well than the ole karwa taxi s  i hope they ll maintain their good image though  
of rid in one  the only comment i can make be that last friday morning from decoration roundabout towards the ramada juction  one decide that he would try and cut me up and flash lights honk horn etc  anyway his number plate should you wish to travel with the uneducated sod be 3203  i have pass this to the police  thought that it may be good for me in the long run instead of rip the ba      s head off  happy motoring  
i should save this thread for future update when these nice and polite driver get a taste of how to rip people off in qatar  i remember the same be say about the karwa drivers a few year back  deja vu  p

doha shopping availability of english book in qatar in contemplate a move to qatar  i be wonder about the availability of english book a this be one of my favorite hobbies  is there such a thing a a public library  or be english book only available in bookstore  in which case be there a huge mark up in comparisson to the us or canada  thanks   
no public library  it have yet to get off the ground  and just the one bookshop  if you re a book lover you ll be disappoint  the paperback seem to be reasonably price but i think the price of some of the hardback be rather inflate  there s always amazon  
and if you read anything other than fiction your choice will be fairly limited  
hi there  loki be right  no major book store here except for a saudi owned franchise call jarir  you might find a few of the late paperbooks but it a rather dismal selection if you be a book lover and be use to stack shelf that you see at chapters  borders or barnes  noble  best bet be amazon and pick up book from dubai  btw  i be a member of a book club and there be several more  if you be interested in join  shoot me an email on exochoc  hotmail com  
   one book store   be slightly unfair  you ll find a selection of popular cheap paperback at carrefour  lulu hypermarket and some of the self styled   bookshop    there s a small reading library at garvey s  but most of the english reader i know stock up at lhr departure and then swop amongst themselves  doha players have most of the old british council selection  but of course  that be destroy by the bomb   
   one bookshop   be in no way an unfair assessment  the supermarket may have a few book on their shelf but that do n t make them bookshop and anyway be they book you would want to buy  look at the bestseller list on amazon  how many of these book can you find in the supermarket  come to that  how many can you find in jarir   
 article in today s gulf times    300  000 book go beg for reader    apparently the qatar national library  which contain 50  000 book write in english and be free to anyone who can get past the paperwork and joining formality  have a decline membership  could this be that no one know it be there  i ve do my homework on doha and i have n t come across a public library  and it have not be mention on this forum  does anyone know where it be locate   
can somebody give me the detail about qatar national library  regard paul 
is n t it along the corniche somewhere  maybe sort of in the post office region

visas and permits wife husband with family sponsorship to work if your wife  husband under family sponsorship of your sponsor want to work do they have to transfer the sponsorship to new sponsor or they can work without sponsorship change  what be the step  
no  they do n t have to change sponsorship  they can work under family sponsorship  
they can work  only thing new employer need  will be noc from husband wife to allow to work 
hi  if your spouse be under your sponsorship  mean the visa indicate on his her qatar id or resident permit be family visa  then there be no need for them to be sponsor by an employer unless you feel that there will be more benefit that you can get if your spouse will get to be sponsor by the company they get accept at  but if your spouse s visa be just family visit  and they land a job with another company and you can not have him her under family visa  you just have to submit a no objection letter to transfer the sponsorship  
people under family visa can work without transfer visa but most of the company now require the person to secure a labor card or a work perpim from the labor department if they would like to work  some company require trasnfer of sponsorship  
they do n t have to transfer their sponsorship under the company  unless they either want to or the company require their transfer  but  a afifa indicate  they must obtain a work permit from the relevant authority in order to work in qatar legally  
 how do you know if the spouse visa be   family visa   or family visit if it say   vis   okay the spouse can work without sponsorship transfer on the basis of no objection unless they choose or employer choose  then where can you obtain the   work permit   from what be afifa and what be the step  time frame  etc   
 6 month   family visa   and   family visit visa   be the same  if you want the residency for your wife  you have to take her under your sponsorship for further rp  after that rp be issue  after that work permit be obtain in the ministry of labour   
is this true a wife on husband s sponsorship can get work permit but if the husband be on wife s sponsorship he can not  
no  it s not true  
so the husband can keep the same sponsorship under wife and just apply for a work permit without change rp  what be the step to get work permit and process and timing

if she know cook etc  she can make delicious dish and snack  also she can learn many language through online it be free  she can improve her english through online study  if she know paint or tailor she can earn bite extra money by do  if she have do any beautifican course she can join in any of the parlour  if she be find animal she can give some food and water to the street cat or bird  if you need a marhaba magazine i will give you a copy  best of luck and a pleasant stay in qatar  
sounds like a great title for a low budget film  o  
hello  i guess it all depend on what kind of person your wife be  maybe she like to exercise then she can go to aerobics class n stuff  she can do yoga or she can even go to ezdan and get a package or sth for gym and swim pool and stuff  and it also depend where you re stayig  she can even sign up for a website  ql let s say  where she can learn stuff abt the country and news about the country  and she can make friend maybe  she can visit the musuems here when she come but after some time what i metionned be pretty much all  hope she like it here   
why this world be not fair  why expat husband be n t get pms with tel  no    liked your new prof  pic   
just give her your credit card and she ll find more than one way to keep herself busy    
i ve be here only 2 week and i be absolutely bore out of my mind  my compound be very small and be desert  remind me of a western flic  without the tumbleweed  where be she from  she can hang out with me i ll teach her english  kathy 
everything will start up again in the next few week a people start return from the summer holiday  tonnes of happening in qatar during the autumn winter season    
i m hop you be right      i d like gravy and cheese on my fry   
visas and permits maximum period of a visit visa  i m currently in doha on a 3 month visit visa  anybody can please tell me  whether i can extend this futher more  maximum of how many month  
maximum 6 months brother after that you have to exit from qatar  
after 6 month you can get an extension also   
i be on tourist visa for 1 month  can i also get extension  for how many month and how much  tnx a lot  
you ca n t get an extension  may be i could be wrong  but extension be valid for family visa holder  after they have clear their medical  
no extension for tourist visa i think  
ok  tnx a lot  do you know any company hiring for office staff  
you can also extend your tourist visa but very costly a compare with extend a family visit visa  maybe what you can do be exit from qatar then  after three month  apply again for a family visit visa  if you have a relative here  
you can extend a family visit visa for a maximum six month  but in any case that you have to extend it again after your 6 month limit  you can do that  too  i think upto 1 month  more  you just have to submit application form again to immigration with your flight booking detail  
hi rtaure tnx  what be the requirement in extend tourist visa and how much  if i exit  i can go back in qatar after 3 month  
you guy be mix family visit visa and tourist visit visa  family visit visa  when you be sponsor by one of your family member  initially be valid for 1 month  and can be extend later for another 5 month  total 6 month stay  after undergo medical examination  tourist visit visa be be valid for 30 day and can be extend for another 30 day  60 day stay in total

nice trey so pwede ko n pala apply ng residence visa yung wife  son ko  khit 3 month bank statement makita ko   
hi my husband and i just go through the whole rp thing  we have to give 4 month worth of bank statement so you should double check  will save you alot of run around 
i be go to add  you good check with your company liason officer a to the bank statement  i think it depend on your salary as well because a friend be ask for a 6 month bank statement  
it depend on your company s pro c connection with the authority  i get family visa with 3 month bank statement  no water or electricity bill be produce  
some say 3 month  some say  4 month   maybe i will take chance for 3 months who know  if they reject my application  ill try 4 month  up to six month  be it possible    
better ask first your pro because some bank charge you per bank statement  cbq charge 50qr per bank statement be it 6  4  or 3 month  since they will charge me anyway  i get 6 month statement instead of just 3 to be sure  
is birth certificate of wife be really require   and bytheway  waht be mofa

visas and permits medical examination info  hi all  i finish my medical exam here in doha  i would like to know besides hiv and tb  be there any other disease check in the medical examination  im only interest in the disease that will make me fail the exam  and how many day or week will the result will be available  thanks 
sif you work in the admin job then u only need to check hiv and ptb result after 3 working day  if you work a a medical  paramedical or any food handler job  you also need to check hepab and hepac   
im an i t  guy so guess i dont have to worry about hepa  what about other std disease  do they check those  
but try to be clear from all these before come here  welcome to qatar  
is the medical exam result always take 3 work day  beacuse my colleague do the fingerprinting 2 week after his medical exam and he say the medical exam result take 2 week  and the only thing for him to know if he pass the medical exam be because he do the fingerprinting process  and be there anyway to know if you pass the medical exam  
once you be do w  ur medical exam you can check w  the medical commission at least after 3 working day  just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you ll get to know if it ready or not  for a medical employee it usually take about 2 wks to have the result do due to other test  e i  creatinine test  that have to be send to hmc for investigation  in your case  you be only require to undergo blood test  hiv   chest x ray  ptb   so i think it wont take long that much  dont you have mandoop representative for your company  he be suppose to follow up all these thing and you can always check w  him  good luck  
thanks apple for always reply on my post  another thing  after medical will i immediately go for fingerprinting or it will be for another week or so  
yes  you can do the fingerprint immediately  so  just relax everything will be ok   
everyone be check for hepatitis c  not just those in medical or food business  after the medical your sponsor be alert via sm about the result  pass fail  assuming all be good next be fingerprint and after that your residence permit can be process  
so if it s find positive do can one obtain iqama  
no  any positive in any of the 3 test and you re denied residency and send back whence you come

qatar living lounge new to qatar    my wife and i will be move to qatar in september  can anyone give u some info of what to expect and basic advice  also i be an ex pro footballer look for a decent standard football any clue to contact etc and how i get involve out there  
lewis first of all  wellcome to qatar in advance  you will slowly find out that qatar be a nice and safe place to live and raise your family a well the weather here in september be quite pleasant  but a bit humid when you be in public  be sure not to wear clothes that offend local custom and traditions women can wear what they like but again  it should n t be too revealing or transparent more importantly  to avoid unwanted attention from other men you say you play football  you can join ql football group  you will update on whats happenning around doha  football wise and btw  which team do you support   these be just a few tip you can find more here in this site use the search option  
mr m very well say  if you be a football soccer player before then you will be a football fanatic now  im sure you will have alot of fun living here  
lewishamilton  here be an honest report  be prepare to often put your patience level beyond your limit in many daily situation  the driving here be insane and extremely risky  the professionalism level be quite substandard when compare to the developed world  services here be generally very poor  you will witness all around you  extremism of social segregation and exclusion  where laborer and maid be marginalize and exclude from the main stream society  during the summer month  may to september  the heat be extreme  it can reach  50 c  many people leave qatar and those who stay  stay indoors  during those month  life be all about work  home and shopping mall  no rain and sand storm instead  your home and car will be cover with fine brown dust  as thin a cement or talc powder  when can damage your electronic appliance and your health  you ll always have to be aware and think of how not to offend  such a what you wear  what you say  what you drink and eat and when

thank you all for your quick response  that really helps how do i find the ql football group  we will be move to west bay  be there many football club semi pro club level  i be an arsenal fan lol please i have hear all the joke already    with regard to the beach be you allow to sunbath  can men go around topless  what do non muslim women men wear on the beach  or be there specific place people go for this kind of thing  and be you allow to hold hand in public etc  be you a footballer mr m  
in private  hotel  beach  both for men or woman  there be no restriction  just like elsewhere   in public beach  for men there be no restriction  for woman  it not so much about the official restriction  it more to do with the fact that many people  guy  be not prepared  educate  to behave in the presence of a woman in a bikini  reactions and consequence may vary  
oh okay i see understandable  so what be the name of the best place i e the private beach and hotel to get o and what s the cost to go there  
mostly any beach in the mediterranean sea  some in southeast asia  south america and australia  just kid  beaches here look nice in picture but often there be not that great  mainly because of the sand which be earthy dusty and the extreme heat start in may  here in doha city  they destroy all public beach and all we have leave be the hotel  intercontinental hotel  perhaps the most popular  not necessarily the best a the beach be artificially prepared the sea floor be construction debris cover with algae  recently they have build a series of artificial beach  between the intercontinental and the pearl  in qatara  a cultural village partially operate   the beach be prepare to be public but they be subject to a cover fee  all these beach be artificial so expect dusty sand and sea bed with construction debris  if you want a natural sandy beach with the desert dune in the back set  you need to drive to the sealine  you need a 4x4   there be a few others s   
for sale  trophy cabinet  unused  enquiries to arsenal football club  o  
it s a scam  they do n t have even a cabinet    
sightseeing and tourist attraction best beach in qatar  where be the best beach in qatar  maybe a silent and romantic bay  where to go for it

go to wakra or umsaeed   img nid 73057 title desc link none align left width height 0  
some hotel have beach  otherwise  like darude say  you get ta drive  get a marhaba book  descriptions of all the beach and direction   be kind than necessary  for everyone you meet be fight some kind of battle  
get taxi or ask somobody to drive you to sealine resort  there you find sandy white beach  
you dont know me  dont even try     img nid 98090 title new desc link none align left width height 0  
the best beach be toward al khor and ask for al ghariya beach     but dont use the new road to al khor use the old road the go to shmal    
 al khor 1 be fine  you will find crabs swim with you  having size of 2 adult hand  small fish pass and touch your leg   p   you can imprison a man  but not an idea  you can exile a man  but not an idea  you can kill a man  but not an idea    benazir bhutto  
beach beside intercontinental hotel be good  try it  if it s true that we be here to help others  then what exactly be the others here for  
i also recommend the dukhan beach  heck dunno why i have be promote that beach  buts it nice   wakra beach u get to wade in about knee deep water for about 200  300 metre in to get deep water  someone correct me if im wrong 
 where be dukhan is it on al khor side or umsaied    d  img nid 13716 title desc link none align left width height 0   img nid 26062 title desc link none align center width height 0    imagination be more important than knowledge    
dukhan be about 100 km  correct me if i m wrong  from doha  take the new road  it s unter construction but already good and v smooth  much good than the old one  you go to education city and then just follow the sign to dukhan  the water be nice  but i do not find the white sand i be dream of  many many shell and not very fine sand  maybe i be at the wrong spot  
sightseeing and tourist attraction could you suggest the best holiday destination in the world  holiday destinations and your experience  
maldives      
hmm  there be so many beautyful places but for me still one of the best i have see untill now be cuba or camargue  near to the border of spain also malta be great  i think important be to have an open heart and mind  so you can see and discover the beauty of each country  
man   honestly depend on what u prefer  beach  hill station    wild life   
maldives  i suppose  is it easy to go maldives from qatar  
masai mara kenya sharangetti  tanzania mombasa  kenya wild life and sandy beach  mindblowing  
yeah   quite easy    n it not a very expensive place i think  
pagudpod  ilocos norte 
new zealand of course    maybe im bias but it have everthing  beach  sail  scuba diving  mountain  ski  great food  sheep of course for those lonely night  
australia down under be the only place to go  white sandy beach  fantastic coral reef  unbelievable rain forest  outback wilderness and even snow  you will need at least 4 week to justify the airfare but i can promise you an experience you will find nowhere else  after all  i come from the land down under

the water be turbid  any reef there  thanks wongqatar 
but i do n t know the exact location  that s why i ask  
be snorkel at dukhan off the beach and in zekreet off the kayak be ok at both place  i think fuwairit would be nice  also the national park off the north coast would be good to check out sometime 
hi guys  nice to have the location for snorkel  is anyone able to be more precise and give exact location  i know the time be close to be over this year due to gelly fish  anyway  please advice the best location to snorkel  thanks in advance for your answer 
i go snorkelling two day ago off the coast of dukhan  about 2 km to the right of the water sports club  near to the desalination plant  some massive rock and colourless coral but there be quite a few different type of fish there  include some huge angel fish  very very nice spot  and yes  the jelly fish be here now    
 best place be fuwarait beach  swim striaght out and there be lot of coral  different fish  sea greass bed and sea snake  if your really lucky turtle  anywhere north of ras laffan should be good  i be at umm tais natural reserves  mention in post above  turn right at al shammal and head east  first island be ras rakkan and be hard to get to  go past until a hamlet and past this you can access umm tais  a few week ago  interesting place but fuwarait be easy to get to etc    sandy   beach we use to go to  al dhakriah mangrove  there be generally less to see on west coast than the east coast unless you go to place near construction which for the east coast be now a lot   hence i recommend french beach  fuwarait  there be also a few nice location you can snorkell in the inland sea  although current at certain time be very very strong  go past coastguard station at mouth and head along towards saudi until you see obvious shallow   
from what you all have say  fuwarait beach be a perfect place to explore  to enjoy and witness it natural reserve  thanks for the share  i m really wait and seek for answer of where to go and spend for our weekend vacation and adventure  hawaii snorkeling tour

socialising jogging along corniche hi  strange question maybe i m not in doha yet but will be move soon  is it safe and accept for a woman to be jog outside  in the evening  and what would be a good place  i be think along the corniche  
yes it s safe to jog there  the aspire park be also a good place to do some jogging    
yes  it be safe  accept with decent clothing of course 
oh yeah  it s the most safe area for jogging do n t worry  
it be safe for lady everywhere in qatar  nobody can dare even to look at the lady and she do n t want  but some place be unsafe and not allow for single guy 
basically woman be pretty safe to do anything around here  just be street smart and use a little common sense and you should be fine  other option would be to join a all lady gym  or a thread mill at home  loads of woman jog along the corniche   
do n t forget to bring your pitbull  p

have u be to aspire park  it s quite near from saad  many people  family  like to be there during night time  but dunno about bbq 
aspire park  behind villagio have everything you need 
i think there be no park here that allow you to bbq    not sure though but i havent see any   corniche have these mini playground for kid  katara be nice for sightsee  you can bbq at the beach but it a bit far from alsadd though  aspire park have a running path track where you can jog  now  to answer your question  i havent see any park here where you can do all that  especially the bbq thing   
dont go to the park at night  let alone take the child  bad habit  the maximum until 9 pm  bring the family in the morning  see the rise sun  fresh air  good for health  peace 
yes citycenter parkinglot    p 
al rayyan park  near al rayyan village or sports roundabout  it s very big  green and exquisite   
facific  be right  early morning outing for the park and beach be extremely enjoyable  
i live in al sadd and yes  there be no near park within the area too bad for kid  i hope there be something like that in the middle of al sadd  maybe they can convert the parking lot beside lulu to a park    hope so  
thanks everyone for your helpful comment  i ll try go to aspire park  cheers

qatar living lounge dog owner in doha  what be your favourite walk spot  i know an off leash area where we could play fetch would be too much to ask  would it    but where do all you dog owner like to walk your dog  are there beach nearby where we could toss her in the water to cool off  thanks  
al wakrah beach appear to be popular  far a field  any quiet beach area  
qwerty  thanks  have you see other dog be walk there  how do the local and others react  sounds like a good idea for a friday morning jaunt  
vw  yes  i have see many people with dog on the beach  however  steer clear of local especially if they have child with them  
no worry  i respect others  space and a such i have have no issue so far  as long a other dog have be on that beach all be well  we be responsible and clean up after our dog too  of course  thanks again qwerty  much appreciate  
never off the leash  but along najma be a nice stretch of grass  http  www xanga com home aspx  user bbetz  nextdate 2  2f15  2f2006 23  3a59  3a59 999 
bbetzinqatar  xanga be offline right now  but i assume you mean najma past the mall roundabout  it s a bit too busy there i think  ok for people but not for an overly friendly dog  op 
yes  that s where i m talk about vw  i do n t take our dog off the leash  so it s not a problem for me that the roadway be busy  he really like that stretch of grass  since the only real greenery he usually see be desert shrub   i sometimes have to keep him on a short leash if anyone be out jog or walk  but it do n t seem like the area be frequent very much by others most of the time that i ve be out there  
cool  thanks  it s a great spot indeed  just that every time i ve drive by there s be lot of pedestrian traffic  cheers  
well i usually walk my dog near the gulf cinema n walk like 2 km from there  i do n t usually find people walk there so it s good for my dog coz shez scar of people specially kidz   i use to go to corniche almost everyday to walk my dog  if u go at like 3 be on normal dayz you would n t find alot of people walk  but if u go there on a friday night you ll find it hard a all the kidz and people will be walk next to you or behind you  last thursday it be really quite there  usually there be lot of people on thursday and fridayz   but other non holiday dayz you would n t find alot of people  
on our foreign ministry s site i read that it be absolutely forbidden to bring rottweilers  dobermann and boxer dog  would be a pity so i d have to leave my believe rottweiler kelly with my parent  does anybody have a clue why this be so  because they be consider dangerous  i mean a pit bull would be more dangerous then those three race   yes i know  any dog can be dangerous in the wrong hand  even a yorkshire  though there would be little reason to fear him    where would you buy dog in qatar  i mean  if i d have to leave kelly at home  i d love to have some dog around to keep me company if there be no woman who d volunteer for the job  gg  rene           think different  
family life in qatar safety for woman hello  how safe be it for lady to move alone  do indian lady move freely and alone on their own or by public transport  taxi  we be use to uae life which we feel safe  is it comparable  thanks 
 this country be safe more than u think    drink beer save water    
i think u time go by qatar will be not safe u before  see a lot of rape case  shoot which it not publish in the newspaper  robbery etc  it evolution us the country expand and so be the crime  
safe in qatar as long a they carry a loaded ak 47 with them all the time  who say guns breed violence  
qatar be one of the safe country in the world  and what stupid comment be these  i feel like people on these forum just want to scare people away  s i ve pmed you a link with stats   i love qatar  http  www iloveqatar net 
news from qatar http  www gulf times com site topics article asp  cu 2  item 165242  version 1  template 36  parent 16 
qatar be no longer a safe place to live in when compare to what it be before  seeing be believe  the other day my wife be just wait for me to take the car out from the park area of our flat  she be stand inside the parking area but she be busy on her mobile  when a guy in a honda civic stop and ask her to hop in  do you call this safe  i have see this happen to so many woman in qatar  no one be try to scare away people it be the fact  please open your eye and dont go by statistic  
bibs  your topic message above be not really accurately describe safety in qatar  this instance  that happen with your wife  almost happen almost everywhere in other country  if i be take a cab in cairo  where i live  i will get ton of offer to hop into someone s car  not necessarily because i be pretty  but because girl be hit on generally speak  i ve be here in doha for a couple of year  with family or without  face the usual hassle  downsides  persistent car follower  at mall guy throw their cell phone number at girl  in bar some guy impose themselves  but usually there be guard  on the beach guy stare and offer company with no pressure  on the cornich  for long walk  jogging and workout  guy may try to talk to her  but if the girl be serious enough  no one can catch up with here speed to begin with  unless he be a highly athletic trainer or something   generally men stare  specifically from certain down trodden ex pats from some least deve   
in the last 4 year i have go to the vegetable market  the souqs the corniche and everywhere in between many time alone  i be a blond decent look westerner  have i get star at  always and it creep me out  but never have i felt unsafe  i keep my head up  walk fast and in a confident manner  no one would dare mess with me be my attitude  it seem to work so far  
what u should have do be  u should have go to that civic guy  spit on his face and bang him nicely coz he he deserve it very well if u ignore such  they wouldnt change and others would become like him  
i be more than surprised to see all these comment  live and work in qatar a a blond woman  i have to admit i have never encounter any of the above mention  even go to the fruit and vegetable market  where in any case  it be much good if you have company with you  not because people stare  but they be use to deal with men a mostly on friday the men do the shopping  wherever you go  if they recognise you be foreigner   because you be different  they will look at you and the inflation will rise 200  in every shop  at least they will try   qatar be no different than any other country but a lot more safe if you behave naturally you will not be molest  one thing more  on the street it be very much a man  world and your will see relatively few woman go alone shopping  so for many people this be really strange  i go to a small supermarket nearly everyday to buy milk and the boy insist on carry the one bottle to my car  this alway make me feel foolish a i be   
qube membership what do you think about it  after pay for the membership fee  we still have to pay for the entrance fee  is it fair enough  
qatar living lounge saturday night in doha  qube nightclub  hi all  me and some friend from london be look to come over to doha for a couple of week  whats the party scene like on friday and saturday night  i hear that in qatar nobody go out on saturday  be that true  where would you go for rnb and hiphop  and ive heard alot about a club call qube be it any good  any feedback would be welcome thanks  
if you enjoy filipino cover band and lot of asian variety in the crowd then the qube be great  however if you enjoy more of the western flair you be down to garvey s  rugby club  and rydges  of these your best bet for fri and sat night  my opinion  so no flame from anyone  be go to be rydges  the bar be under new aussie management with the goal of much good music and faster service  this past weekend be quite busy and the music be good enough to dance to  so there you hav it  one recommendation 
go to beirut  thats where the clubing be i always tell the truth  even when i lie 
is pretty good on a thursday night  nice crowd of people and a good british band  not club though  for club there be only the pearl  with the awful dj jojo  and cloud nyn where the crowd be very very young  i guess if you want club you really do have to go to beirut  
 not good idea to come to have a party in qatar  qatar be a   muslim   country  muslims be not allow to drink alcohol  be in unnecessary co ed place  coming to qatar to have party be strange  maybe you could save money for other purpose other than party   
i agree with tyler and bbksiu  although the best way to enjoy your weekend in doha be by get together with friend in one of our house  have dinner  bbq  and drink  alcohol  you can buy alcohol if you have the license  play some game  e g  risk and card  watch the late dvd  you can put music on and dance  becareful your neighbor      and if you too drink to go home  your friend can get you a lift  or there always a taxi  so you not worry to get cought on drunk and driving  
someone agree with me  that never happen  perhaps i take my mediaction today and have a rare lucid think  p 
 amaru immortal  clubs  i mean night club  here in qatar be no comparison to what you d find in a non muslim country  they both serve alcohol  have music  live djs  but that s where the comparison end    where would you go for rnb and hiphop    take a plane and go somewhere else     i d suggest heat or mercury lounge in melbourne for rnb hip hop      bit of promotion from an ex employee  if you still wan na come to the middle east for clubbing  go to beirut or istanbul  maybe even cairo for that matter  or go to goa  india if you wan na spend xmas at trance party on the beach  or go pub hopping in bangalore    i hear that in qatar nobody go out on saturday  be that true    true  we go out on thursdays  that s the weekend here  happy hour start at 5 30pm   
it suck 
thanks for the info  i have friend in doha and they say that there be a rumour that two top london djs  one playing hiphop rnb the other playing house will be perform  if anyone have far info that would be great  
for the coolest and the noisy place in doha  qube be the place    they ve get the crowd with the ohh la la band    check this out  www mocha com ph they be the performer  
socialising be there a night club here in doha  if they have a night club here in doha  do i need to be a member first to enter the club  and be there any regulation in that club  and how much do i need to pay for the member  and if there be no membership thing how much the entrance  can anyone here  can help me  thanks in advance  
go and ask at ramada hahahahahaha my fav  place 
there be good night club here in qatar  hotel ramada  qube mariot  pearl lounge cloud nine etc so many the best place to be be qube or pearl lounge 
cube in the ramada  membership card cost qar 25 and be valid until your rp expire  you need your local id to get the membership card  entrance fee qar 80 for men  1 drink include   free for lady before 10pm  dresscode  casual  no flip flop or cap

hello smoke        
thank you guy for the information  i really appreciate  
 yes a a woman you will find it very easy with the nightclub here  we try to go to pearl on thursday night but be deny entry because there be no   girl   in our group of 4  
club here in doha  there a lot but few consider to be good  
socialising  qube nightclub i be the only english lady who like the qube  the music be good to dance too  the people be friendly and the price reasonable but whenever the name be mention all people talk about be the   lady for sale   there  for goodness sake like most place if thats what you want then good luck   whatever anyone say i like go there    b x  
they play nice music  i love go there too  i be with ya  hip hop be n t as complex a a woman be  
i hate qube  i like irish harp  p 
i dont mind the harp but it get too busy and stink of smoke  one good thing about the uk be no smoke inside i dont like hip hop so go to qube thursdays after 10pm when it play dance music too and stay open till the small hour  like club at home  
which be the club where the music be soft cos i get irritated if i cant talk to my friend due to the loud music  
the music be loud but thats because the place be big  i have never be able to not hear someone talk to me  mind you be blonde not many people talk to me haha 
a club with soft music  lol  i like qube  coz they have lovely music  when joe spin it  and love to zip on long island  its a good place  if ur jus want to have fun urself  and with ur mate hip hop be n t as complex a a woman be  
uk and who be julie   p 
so blondi  do u recommend the qube for a peaceful drink   
 pajju a you can see from the above picture  i be the one on the right and julie be the one on the left  we frequently visit the qube  when will you join u nice lady             he who dares wins   derek edward trotter  
hi everyone i be prabesh kumar baral i be do recovery from long time if u have any problem with your harddisk and any data lose please call me 6240262 prabesh i will halp you as much a i can and very cheap also 
socialising cube     hey guy have you be to cube  i think it cool it just at the back of ramada hotel it like a night club  though i think it hard to get inside especially on thursday night i just find last night while make a detour you know the traffic  while i be drive i see this long line little do i know it a line to get inside this new club  do you think it own by ramada hotel  anyway it a good thing they be already permit build club  
i go tuesday  i thaught it be pretty poor tbh  lot of work woman and a bad philipino coversband play rock ballards of the 80  the design be interesting  nothing like a propper nightclub  far too bright  no disco light  very restrictive about upstairs couples vip area  it remind me of nightclub you see in american movies pretty synthetic and fake  i couldnt work out the booze pricing policy a bourbon and coke cost the same price a a coke  and everyone from work have rank hangover despite quit at 11 30 yes it own and staff by ramada  
the place be just too big that it do n t make the room pleasant  just my opinion though  
i go on thursday and have a good time with some friend  i think the band be pretty good  maybe i be hypnotize by the daisy duke short the singer be wear though  everyone that have go before me sum it up a feeling like a warehouse and it s mostly due to the white wall i think  kinda remind me of a high school dance in the gymnasium  buncha guy stand around leer at the girl  hopefully after the asian games they will take everyone s advice and at least paint the wall and dim the light to iimprove the atmosphere of the place  the ratio of guy to girl be about the same a everywhere else  10 guy to 1 girl  
it good place for me for hang out  lot of chinese and pilipina there and specially the performer the 3 beautiful sexy singer and their band great performance  that time i ll go there it be very great because i meet chinese lady and she offer me some deal    its good    
well if thats what you want to go to the doha night club for then thats your deal  night life in qatar hmmmm be there such a thing  from what i can tell they be full of philipino woman and old western men with a few other undesirable in  doha amongst many other city in the world have a lot to learn about night club  what make them good and what make them bad  predominantly what make them bad be the client that frequent them  in the case of doha they will always be bad  face facts if you get to a nightclub to pick up woman  of any culture  then your not in to club  
to the majority of people whom have attend real club  go for the music  to get dress up to impress not only others but themselves  many club be just institution to carry on drinking after normal club closing time and to pick up member of the opposite sex  real clubbing  is   music  dance not what have be describe on here  this be not just my opinion  there be many club web page  and you will find it hard press to find a description of what be describe on this forum  have you ever be to ibiza  grant the drug scene be far to prevalent there but it be all about fun music and dancing  not about pick up woman  
some good party though  sometimes  admirals  pearl  provide that there be enough alcohol in the blood  for club  well fly to lebanon  
you re right spoerry  for real club go to lebanon or wait for a lebanese to open a club in doha like what happen in dubai with c bar 
guys a lebanese club very nearly happen in one of the major hotel  unfortunatly the person in question leave qatar  he be a good friend and i know his plan and trust me it a complete shame it never go further     places like the buddha bar would go down a treat here  or something not quite so big a ministry of sound  liquid  pasha happy hunting  we all need the entertainment 
i cant believe this forum  the cube  a club  are people serious  ha ha ha ha i havent giggle so loudly for age  thanks for the humour  brainsalad you go there and some chinese lady offer you some deal  you be joke arent you i mean no one could be that seedy and be proud of it  dvargas you didnt enlighten u with your wisdom of club      anyone who know about club know it not about standard  it about the music  the dance the adrenaline  not about pull some sweaty speck who come up to you with his checked shirt and fetch gold necklace  thanks guy for make me giggle   the cube a club he he he

asas  falcon  al fardan towers  the residence at four seasons  grand hyatt  i m not sure i d bother with an agent  just go to their office on premise  mandi 
hi mandi  al fardan towers be on the list but havent heard of asas or falcon till now  will definitely check them out  i see youre still here  you be super helpful a year ago when they first start talk to me about this gig  how be thing  s  as a matter of biology  if it bite you it s probably female  
falcon towers be my favorite  but see also beverly hills towers in west bay  and i m do great  thanks  sitting at home with about 8 inch of snow  more to come  but i ll be back in doha wednesday  mandi 
asas be nice i have a couple of friend who live there  beverly hills be nice too  a be the w residence  i second mandi  just go to their office and do n t bother with an agent  you ll get a good offer that way  
chuckling here   snow  ah no thanks   jfk and ohare be bad enough  weather here be nice  come back     olive  you happen to know the asas website by chance   as a matter of biology  if it bite you it s probably female  
yup  http  www asasqatar com asassite index html 
awesome  thanks for the site olive pictures look great and will check it out this weekend   thanks   ps  to anyone else hit this thread  initial reaction after call with craig from mirage  re agent who post in ql  be very positive  responded to a single post here in ql with a call half a day later  call be very easy and he understand exactly what i be request  follow it up with confirmation of same in several email that same day  calling off corporate relo agent to see how mirage play out  so far very impressed   as a matter of biology  if it bite you it s probably female  
chuckling  or i could just look out my window from the bloody ezdan   lol i think google earth must be the devil   as a matter of biology  if it bite you it s probably female  
the westbay cc area be pretty small  so you should be able to drive yourself around and visit each building   maybe a dozen building  i think they all have onsite management that can show you what be available  personally  i think the pearl and falcon towers adjacent to the 4 seasons hotel be the best unit and best locate especially if you be able to join the four seasons spa  health club  al farden tower  where the bmw dealer be locate  be very nice  but no balcony if that be important to you  44 westbay tower also have very nice unit and great view from the upper floor  the residence at the w hotel be also quite nice  but no balcony  
aye  would definitely prefer a balcony if available but not a deal breaker   as a matter of biology  if it bite you it s probably female

moving to qatar what french school  voltaire or bonaparte  hi all  moving to qatar soon  what do you recommend a a french school  lycee voltaire or lycee bonaparte  and why per experience  thx 
they be both good school  voltaire tuition fee be much more than bonaparte  depending on the age of your child you may find a place in bonaparte  usually they do not have place  i recommend you contact them directly  and if your child be transfer from a lyc e in montr al this will help   good luck 
i have a 4yo daughter who will be 5 next september  i guess it s school time  so we be think gs  grande section  for her  in her daycare here in quebec  she be in a french speaking environment  so we have no other option to continue in the french system  the canadian school in doha offer only an english program  i hope it work in either voltaire or bonaparte  i hear that voltaire be open a new school  any news  and how about my 1 yo daughter  where can i put her  thx 
 hi  i move from montreal to doha almost 3 year ago  my old go to bonaparte and be very happy with the school  as for voltaire they be open a new campus in al waab and the main campus will remain in west bay as for your one year old  if you want a french nursey you have petis pas and a newly open one call perles d   avenir  there s also a french website than can help you with all the question you have www vivreauqatar com  bonne chance tania  
hi tania  good news for voltaire  especially that i may be interested in live in al waab  i hear that housing be more affordable there than in west bay and that it s a pretty nice neighborhood too  i think i ll try for both school  i m look for a grande section  gs  level so hopefully with the new campus open soon i may be lucky to find a place  
just to inform you  even you choice the voltaire or bonaparte school  i just know the french nursery name perles d avenir  it s new one  but incredible fantastic  i have my daughter there  26 month old  and she and i really love it  if you need more detail check their website  www perlesdavenirqatar com  about voltaire  i know that they will open a second school  and they be a nice french school  if you be french you will have a big discount on it  i know that they provide a qualified french education and add with that the history geography and arabic language to be adapt to the qatar  i think that an interesting addition  good luck to your choice  
i forget to precise  bonaparte have a really limited available place in kindergarten  may be they be already full  you have to contact u before  in case of you could do the registration by distance  in other case  a voltaire will open a second school  you will have more chance to have available place  but you have to know that in qatar the registration in school  nursery  be really difficult because there be too much child for a little number of good school  so do it as soon a possible    good luck 
we be not french but canadian  and i doubt they give any priority to french canadians  what i do be i send a pre admission request and i be tell to wait until the commission decide  i do n t know if this be the standard procedure or just a subtle way to say no  and besides i do n t think i have a back up plan a these be the only french school in doha  unless you can refer me to other school  and my final question  in case nothing french work  do you think be it too late to put my daughter in an english school even though she do n t speak english  she will be 5 year old at the school entrance   thanks 
dono  i m sure that you could n t find in bonaparte because they have priority people  but  at 90  i m sure that you could in voltaire  they have priority to qatari and french  but they open a second big school so they have lot of available place for now  try to send them an email  they will answer you  for any english or other old school  it will really difficult to register your child  you have to do in advance  so inform you immediately  try to call few school and you will have an idea  how old be your child  do he she need to have an exam to enter in french shcool  do he she speak french fluently  good luck 
peter  i already write to voltaire and be tell to wait for the decision by the admission commission  i m keep my finger cross for voltaire a it look like a nice school  besides i have no other choice and be scar that my daughter may waste the whole year because of lack of place in school  that would make me think twice about the move to qatar  we ll be there in june and she ll be 5 next august  and she s fluent in french  but do n t speak english at all  what be my option  
i m sure that the commission will be ok  they be well advance in the process  and they speak to the radio that they will open the school  i m not afraid by that but i understand your situation  here the school be to much full  some company do not accept anymore family because they can not be sure to assure a place at school  do n t worry for you and continue to keep contact with the school  i know that they like parent that insist  keep contact  want always news about the expected registration   like that they will know that you be serious and motivate  so continue your email  your call  good luck 
qatar living lounge expats buy property in qatar have any expat on this forum either buy property in qatar  or consider buying and then reject  i e zig zag tower  the pearl etc  i m try to evaluate whether or not this would be a good investment  what do you think be the potential risk and upside  if you have buy  what be your experience of the process and in hindsight  be it a good decision  regards 
personally  i think the real estate industry may start a down slide soon  it seem like rents have skyrocket within the last year or two  it be likely that the asian game have soemthing to do with this and i just can not imagine the price of real estate maintain this insane rate for much long  something have to give  on the flip side of the coin  qatar have be and still be expand at a fast rate  there could continue to be a growth spurt and that would mean that more housing would be need for worker  i m absolutly no help be i  lol  sorry   
i just bring on lagoon plaza  so i be hop the market doesnt come down anytime soon  personally while all this building be go on and while there be a buzz about the place then i think price for property will keep rise  i be read a dubai site the otherday say price be begin to drop due to over supply  i think that problem be a long way off here  plus i bring because my company will give me a housing allowance so they will be pay for my investment and when you look at it like that it a no brainer  icidently i do look at the pearl it be go to be very nice but just not soon enough and i think they be a bit over price  
hey  i look at a place on the pearl in sabban towers  which will be the first complete tower on the pearl  i  unfortunately could n t get the finance fast enough so i lose the apartment  the tower be now sold out  property price be rise roughly 10  per month at the moment and trust me that be not go to slow down in a hurry  they just will never beable to build fast enough to catch up with the demand a have happen in dubai  i definitely think it be a good invetsment  even if the appreciation on the property slow down to 10  per annum that be still a good investment when you condsider the fact that you be currently just pour your rent money into someone else s pocket or mortgage and you could be put that into your on property which you can redeem when you sell the place  for at least the next ten year your investment will be very safe  that be say who know what will happen if america go after iran  there be no return without risk though a i be sure you know a   
what be the problem  i would maybe have a few doubt about the pearl just becasue it reclaimed land but my tower build on solid ground out of concrrete  i think it will be ok for some time to come  the finishing in this country be appauling but you ca n t argue that the building be not solid  
property even in the building i have bring in have go up 20  since it launch  the pearl be add 10  to each phase  its go to keep go  and you be right why should my company put rent money into someone elses pocket when they can pay towards my mortgage  i be happy with 10  apprication on the property  i would have get 5  in the bank and realistically it go to be more than that  10 year be probably about the right amount of time to keep hold of it  by then you will have loisil wackra al khor etc all build and it will be an established market  until then i be hold for the ride  
please clarify  those building will not last long  have you not notice how they be build      
i be now consider lusail a an option but i be wonder if it be go to be too far out initially and will show a slow appreciation  i have see it happen in dubai  the original western villa area be the springs and meadows near the dubai marina and the palm jumeriah  they have subsequently build the arabian ranches and while the springs etc have continue to appreciate dramatically the ranches be struggle a bit  now i believe that the lagoon and the pearl will soon become the centre of doha and lusail will be the suburb do you think the place there be go to hold their value as well a the pearl  whats your opinion  i would be interested to know a you seem to have the same idea about the property market that i do  
forget lusail  it not worth it  
thanks for that qatexpat   you might want to elaborate on that very dismissive statement   why do you feel that it not worth it and what do you base your statement on  
 you sound pretty vague in your confidence  when you say   i hope   and   i think   but you conclude pretty confidently with the term   no brainer    the price of lagoon be above a million for a one bed appartment  such price in the heart of dubai marina have now crash to 0 55 million  still dubai have a high brand equity and good business environment  i be sure you might have do much more research and assessment of the scenario before get in  please elaborate far on your analysis  anyone who buy be pretty convinced of his move specially when there be no clarity on ownership and legislation  the other factor that have literally kill the dubai market be the very high figure of annual maintenance charge of about 10aed sq ft year  please share your analysis with u  ps  i be not critique or analyse your decision to buy  i be only seek more information that you may like to share with u on your analysis  quiet lurker  poor contributer

only if you be qatari or very wealthy  otherwise expats can not own anything  my family and i have be here all our life  in fact my grandfather have be here as long a the country be first discover  not allow to be citizen even if bear and raise here  sad truth  qatarization 
 purchase freehold property only in designate area  as an expat  it do n t make a difference whether you be from the queen s land or otherwise  
u can not buy a property  u can just lease one 
sir  fin  waves  i hear that expat could buy property and get rp for 99 year  not sure if it true but thats what i hear  
zouheir   lol you da man that be only apply to you     cha ching bluepantherback   there be no such thing  no mean no unless you be millionaire then money talk  i be a native expat  yanni bear and raise here  so i be  an all my family and their family and their family  be more qatari then most qatari s   s 
i think there be talk that expat could purchase at the pearl and then would get a long term rp  i m not sure anything ever come of that tho  
sir fin unfortunately it sad you live this country for so long and you don t know the fact about this place  expats can buy property be designate area i e not only in the pearl  it s true the cost of an apartment in the pearl be more than 1m  but you don t necessarily be a millionaire to own one  bank do give mortgage if you be have a long term contract with very high salary

what agency we can hire a car and a driver  i be loooking into hire a car with a driver  have hear some agency here in doha do it  any tip   many thanks 
welcome to qatar motor insurance in doha having read a lot about about the hectic  driving in doha i be wonder whether car insurance be quite costly  i m a 25 year old male from the uk and i ve never make a claim  be i likely to be pay through the roof to insure my v8 4x4 that i intend to buy when i move to doha next month  
insurance be between 3  and 4  a year  and seriously  while the drive keep you on your toe  it be n t that bad  
is that a percentage of the cost of the car  it ca n t be much bad than the m25 in the uk during rush hour  that s pretty much a 80mph free for all anyway  
yep  a a percentage of value of car  i recommend you first hire a car for a week or two so you get use to the roundabout with someone el wheel g  
well  it be 3  in the first year anyway  i think the insurance company might have agreement with the insurance carrier and direct buyer to a particular insurance agency  invariably you will return to the insurance company you use when you buy the car  when the annual renewal come up though you may find that it be way high than 3   or else we be n t skilled persistent enough to negotiate it down to 3    here be a short blog about our experience with car insurance renewal  http  tinyurl com elmrk from my blog about life in qatar  http  www xanga com bbetz 
 i think people who choose to drive huge suv s should pay a premium  call it   no peripheral vision   clause   
life only can be understood backwards  but must be live forward  car insurance not really that bad  in the uk you insure the driver  in here you insure the car  so anyone can drive the car and still insure  if you know what i mean  we pay around 2000 qr for our car  again our car be not a posh car     
novita  that be to be understood per annum or a a monthly fee  raggers 
beware  i think you will find that the car be cover for accident but not people in the car  you may need to take out seperate insurance for the passenger  fully comprehensive in qatar be not the same a fully comprehensive in the uk 
car insurance be quite different from western practice  as noted above  you insure the car  not the driver  which be one of the reason kid here can afford to drive massive landcruisers  despite the slaughter of pedestrian   blood money for non moslems be pretty minimal  anyway   for car over a certain age   2 year  dunno  3rd party be the only option  however  and again a note above  cover for passenger be not automatic so check these thing carefully with your insurance broker  even the possibility of have residual alocohol in your bloodstream when some idiot slam into you some morning have to be specifically cover  so it s not a bad idea to go to a reputable international insurance company if you think you might occasionally have non family passenger or drink beer of an evening  
when you take out full insurance  you will normally be offer the choice of insure the driver and ex number  you choose  of passenger  additionally  a state  you can insure against be over the limit  excess alcohol   although i do not know what would happen if a driver be drunk and have an accident

the rp id  together with your passport  should be submit to the immigration to cancel it  however  they  your sponsor  can report you to the cid a absconding absconded to release them of any responsibility of you  when they get that clearance from the authority  they will no longer issue you an noc letter  and may even report your whereabouts to the police and have you deport  that would be the bad scenario  this happen to someone i know 2 year ago  i m not sure if the procedure change  
azilana  from your thorough answer  you seem to be an hr generalist  what happen to that someone you know 2 year ago  be that person still in qatar or deport already  
 that   someone   be deport   
human resources generalist be a person can mean different thing depend on the company  normally  and hr generalist be similar to an assistant  but for the human resources department  they may help with run background check  the hiring process and any other task associate with human resource  
that someone be deport  sound like you know him her and work with you in the same company sponsor  
and my friend be help her at the time  
yes sure they can  a sponsor be our father in qatar if any problem try to solve it in good manner   
http  answers ask com business management what i m sure kellydinc wo n t mind you copy his her answer word for word  i think that position or title exists in uk  or maybe the us  perhaps  
that i happen to cross pas with back then when i be try to sort out my shyet on similar issue   
moving to qatar shipments to qatar hello all  we be move to qatar in august  need advice on send 2 separate household good shipment  any comment on that  what be the document require to send a shipment  what be require to receive a shipment  any information on household shipment and regulation would be appreciate  thanks  fitri 
follow up the to previous  any idea the transit time for a container from houston to doha  how about the advisability of store shipment in doha  security an issue  thanks  
hey fitri  we move here oct 2004 from dallas and it take roughly 60 day for our furniture and household good to arrive  i m not sure about your second question  as far a i know the shipment make it way to u shortly after it arrive and have clear custom  so we never store it  i suppose it would have be nice to send it 2 month in advance of our arrival though  
thanks for the info  we will be send a shipment from china and then later another from houston  any idea what document be require for ship to and receive in doha  
i believe that the shipping company in the state coordinate with one of the local moving company and handle most of the paperwork  when our shipment arrive we simply have to find the move company here and give them a map on where to deliver the good  there may have be other step handle by my wife or her company  but it seem fairly straightforward  your employer and or move company should give adequate instruction  be aware that they may quarantine and return later anything that they think need to be review for content  like dvd s  vhs tape  book  cds etc  it seem our labeling of box help them in this effort and so some of our dvds that be in the labeled box arrive after quarantine while others that be just haphazardly pack be deliver on the first shipment  http  www xanga com bbetz 
unless thing have change  you will need a residence permit before you can bring in freight 
as far a i know certain item be not allow in the country and wo n t clear custom  eg  gamble item  fur  play card 
as far a i know certain item be not allow in the country and wo n t clear custom  eg  gamble item  fur  play card 
hi fitri  i be from india and have come in to doha 8 day back  the delay in the process be only at the level of the directore i m told  apparently once the good arrive in doha  the local agent contact custom and set a date with them to inspect the good  this take up to a week  after custom go through all item  they give their estimate and clearance  there be a tax of 5  on the good be bring in levied  however household good be exempt from the tax and the agent apply to the directorate for exeption  this be where take time and i m told can take upto 20  25 day to gte the clearance  thus the option seem to be to either pay 5  of the valuation they have do or wait  
hi everyones  thank you for the reply  we ve be talk with the hr services representative of my husban company and there be no problem to ship our good from two different country  and they will take care of everything so one problem be resolve and wait for the next thanks again  fitri 
hi bbetzinqat  just read about your experience with the dvds but be not sure i understand  are you say it be well to not label well and then the stuff wo n t be as likely to be quarantine  or vice versa  thanks  am go to be pack up this summer  aeroquilter

sightseeing and tourist attraction qatar should have amusement parks and water theme parks   whts your say    qatar should think of make amusement park and water theme parks other than make buildings and villa with no one to stay in    whts your say on this    
a water theme park would be an excellent addition to doha s expand list of attraction  i think it would be very well use by all  
a water theme park be what s miss in doha  with unique facilities attractions  it will definitely be an added bonus to the tourism boom of qatar and will be surely love by all  
a healthy idea  
i agree  al bidda family park be a bit not clean a of yesterday when i go  that s the only area i can go to when i need a good stroll with my family  i think qatar can make another one that be even more of a tourist attraction  
 why stop at water park  qatar need more of everything entertaining in nature  1 water theme park  even bahrain have one now  2 spas  not the one attach to the hotel  3 beach resort 4 go kart circuit 5 more movie theater  since it be a nightmare now to reach city center on the weekend  6 competition to qdc  besides allowable to be bring into qatar from the duty free  a other   normal   gcc state do  7 more club 8 shesha place 9 dance bar  nothing wrong with this  they ai n t strip bar  could go on and on but i m almost do at my work day and i m head home but you get the point   
ca n t believe that they be n t any waterparks in doha yet  what a money spinner that would be for someone  i m sure that we be go to be read about plan to build one very soon  well i hope we be     imagine the fun everyone would have  
water park will be a great additional entertainment to qatar  especially for family  but i also have a dream that qatar should have disneyland  that will be much much much fun   
yes  qatar should have a water park  
i think there be some move on that 
a water theme park would be great  some of the pool would need shade a well  what s with all the pool without sun shade over them

family life in qatar kiddie party venue aside from fastfood restaurant does anyone know of venue for a kiddie party  mcdo  kfc be already give  how about a restaurant or a place where we can rent  have the food cater  
if you live on a compound do it have facility you can use  if you do n t live on a compound some of them rent the facility out  i know ghanim gardens use to  if you have a friend that live on a compound maybe they could help 
would you like to have kiddie party cater by fast food plus enjoy a free kiddy ride  that would be great and fun  
they have a party area at jungle zone which be very good  kid can play on the ride and then there be a magic show arrange if you book the party hall  you have to arrange the food from outside so can arrange any good catering to do so  
you can also check the water park on the ground floor of city center   verynice place to entertain the kiddoes   food can b order from any of the joint above   
i also endorse jungle zone  otherwise you have burger king  dairy queen   you ca n t mean what you say unless you can say what you mean  
looks like it be a really long time since you have be to the city center  be it  the waterpark be no more there  in place be a toyota car showroom  and i really doubt whether toyota be in a mood to give that showroom for kiddy to start break glass et all  lol  anyways  other than the compund club halls  you could try one of those hotel ballroom  and if not that big then just yesterday at the royal plaza i remember see something relate to another water themepark  you could check that out  cheers  
 at landmark or villagio do kid party a well  a fraction healthier and they get to make their own pizza  must stop say bizza  haha  
do nt know that    thing really change here in qatar   very fast  
most of the play area  jungle zone  extreme world  rays reef  will do party and i think you can specify food arrangement although most use the ff outlet  other than that  hotel will let you use function room to have party  some will also source mini disco etc  try also dana club  diplomatic club etc  depending on how large your party be  other idea include  picnic  trip to the zoo  ice skating  old kid  although you be provide the supervision and entertainment  hope this help  
thanks so much for the input  be rays reef the one in royal plaza  is it already open  grantley  have you try one of the party at pizza express  do they provide the entertainment as well  
sightseeing and tourist attraction out and about with a one and a half year old  hey all  just get to doha from the uk under 2 week ago  hubby get a job here   which leave me at home with my little girl  can anyone recommend place to go  which be kiddy friendly  and where my husband and i can chill out too  we have be to the villagio  hyatt plaza and souq waqif  thanks  shaz

doha shopping the best place can be visit in qatar  hi all   what be the the best place can be visit in qatar to enjoy with ur friend  ur family  with any one  
souk  
go to dukhan beach resort   sealine beach and play with dune sand there  al shamal beach   al ruwais beach   thats only few   
i personally love souq also  i would maybe go there every day  i also really like the museum  child love the boat and the corniche in general  best place to avoid  villagio  suck and everyone make it sound like heaven with door  
have a go at the doha zoo  apart form the not so many kind of animal  you have a mini theme park with thrill ride  try al khor beach  another historical place to be  and the water theme park off salwa road  
personally  qatar be a boring place  there s nothing really entice place to go here  my advice to you be just stay indoors you ll be safe from rogue teenager who ll beat you and from stupid driver who drive like they have a date with death  zoo  you have that in your country  beach  i bet your own country have good beach resort  water theme park  i do n t think share a pool with someone who only take a bath once in a blue moon be a bad idea  museum  you ll learn more by surf the net  
when your leave this place  
lulu  
i totally  i mean totally  agree with you  doha be a boring place to be as far a family leisure be concern  i ll never ever gon na visit these place again unless there be an occasion that i ld never miss for the world  
the doha international airport on your way out of here    
for me i like the waqif souq  
sightseeing and tourist attraction what would be a great attraction for doha instead of another clone mall in doha  what would you like to see build instead  my top 2 would be  a theme park a water park any other suggestion  
for my kid sake yes that would be great  i do n t want qatar to go like dubai or abu dhabi  qatar be great just the way it be  i like the old fashioned way  let it be  it be a lovely country a it be  we can go to water theme park on holiday  that be a treat for kid  leave qatar a it be  i will hoist that up the flag pole and see who salute it

i be on tourist visa for 1 month  can i also get extension  for how many month and how much  tnx a lot  
you ca n t get an extension  may be i could be wrong  but extension be valid for family visa holder  after they have clear their medical  
no extension for tourist visa i think  
ok  tnx a lot  do you know any company hiring for office staff  
you can also extend your tourist visa but very costly a compare with extend a family visit visa  maybe what you can do be exit from qatar then  after three month  apply again for a family visit visa  if you have a relative here  
you can extend a family visit visa for a maximum six month  but in any case that you have to extend it again after your 6 month limit  you can do that  too  i think upto 1 month  more  you just have to submit application form again to immigration with your flight booking detail  
hi rtaure tnx  what be the requirement in extend tourist visa and how much  if i exit  i can go back in qatar after 3 month

socialising if you be political leader  how will solve this issue  there be a state say x  group a want the bifurcation and group b do n t want it  both be on hunger strike    both have valid reason  
if it a democratic country majority will decide  if it a dictator rule wont mater who want what  
i will listen to the representative of group a and learn y they want bifurcation  then provide them with wat they want  if they get what they want in this country  they wont demand bifurcation  
will wait and watch for how long they can stay hungry  who ever die first lose the game  no need to get into polictics  things can be simplify and should n t be change unnecessarily  
i will have their young child participate in a reality tv show where all of them will fight to death and the last one standing will win  the government will take on the side of the winner  i will call the game the hunger game  
as a politician i would ask my advisor what bifurcation mean and whether our armed force have stockpile of it  
i will kill politics 
i ll tell them to eat cake  
i will tell them qu ils mangent de la brioche    
i will ask sonia gandhi 
i ll go with group a  a they be seek bifurcation since 60 year as far a i know  and will tell group b to wait for 60 year to be hear  
qatari culture qatari wedding we have be invite to a qatari wedding this thursday  and apart from not know anyone  a my husband will be on the men s party and i will be at the woman s party  to state the obvious   i have no idea what to expect and what the custom be  what should i wear  do we bring a gift  what happen during a wedding  i be very honor to have be invite but terrify of make a fool of my self  
qatari wedding  gents section  there sure will be two diff section one each for lady and gent  the practice be to greet the groom and his family elder first  then be seat in the hall  red tea arabic coffee will be served will be call for the buffet dinner have dinner and say good bye and thanks to the groom n the family member and leave  ladies  not sure about the custom  dg  amensia might help  ps  be sure not to use mobile camera phone  
qatari weddings be fun  i have be to 23 wedding on my last count  i love it  it s an amazing culture  try and take a friend with you  and be prepare to dance  just kidding  you will not be allow to take your phone  and be prepare to eat lot of nice food  have fun  
do n t take a gift  and dress like you would if you be go to a wedding back home  the lady all look lovely and spend a lot of time do their makeup and wear nice dress  
i know a girl who go to a qatari wedding  she say it get heat because apparently a lot of them turn up with the same outfit on  very embarassing  
qatari wedding     first of all be confident bc no one notice you so do n t be embarress    dress up just like your own style  no one can bother that what you wear    do n t take a snap with your mobile or camera  be carefull      enjoy with buffet     if you be try to escape from a borring party then pls take a friend with you   
i think it be a bit boring  beautiful decoration  heard they cost 60  000qr   table  lot of sweet  however it get started very very late  left at11 00pm  dinner have not start  out of 300 woman in the room i only saw i dress that i like  most be garish and hideously gaudy  lots of bright bright color  feather  sequin  etc  tons of makeup on  they have a runway and a couple of woman play the drum and wail arabic song rather loudly  girls would get up and dance down the runway  so the old woman could check them out a possible daugher in law contender i ve be tell  finally the light go down about 10 00 the fog and light show start  sort of like a rock concert  the bride then come out and walk very slowly down the runway  eventually people come up and shower her head with money  she look scared to death  i learn she be 20 year old and have never meet her husband to be  but have talk to him on the   
so if i have get it right then i should  be prepare for late dinner ie  eat before i go  dress as ghoulish a i can  not take any photo  piece of cake  look forward to the cultural experience 
from my experience  no matter how flamboyantly u dress up  it nothing compare to the qatari lady there  god  they r all so gorgeous  and their way of dress up be amazing  cant afford  lol     abt the gift  no u dont take a gift to the wedding  usually i visit them few day after the wedding  n give a gift  wat happen during a weddin  well  make sure u sit away from the loudspeaker place at all corner of the hall     u can dance if u want  to the arabic song be play there  hhhmmm   n the food part  it yummy  u can starve for a few day after that to lose all those calorie earn on that one evenin    it fun  enjoy   ps  oh yeah  like many others mention above  dont click any snap  n thats if ever they let u carry ur mobile phone inside  usually they hold it at the entrance  so be prepare to be disconnect from the rest of the world for the few hour u spend there  
oh yeah  late dinner  depend on the arrival time of the bride n the groom  n by the way  the lady get a chance to peep at the groom while he escort the bride to the hall  unlike the men on the other side  who cant see who their friend colleague be gettin married to   
unfortunately  i have find qatari wedding to be a bit depress  i have yet to see it a a joyous occassion  i have be to a few in the last few month  and have be very disappointed  the lady seem to be compete with each other in the dress department  and so some outfit be very outlandish  there seem to be so much politics amongs the different group of lady sit at the table  you know  this group do n t like that group  or this part of the family feel snub for some reason   the bride always look terrify and a bit like a geisha girl for all the make  up on her face  i really feel sorry for her  one of the bride i saw  take about 30 min to walk down the isle in front of u a i do n t think she could move with the dress she be wear   and you be right about the mobile thing  i have mine with me in the hall  it have be with me the whole night  i have to answer a phone call  and all of a sudden my phone be snatch out of my

stay home and relax  play online game or sleep all day  
there be no much thing to do in doha  sealine resort be a nice place but it be too expensive for such small resort and no activity to spend the time with  in even the place look like an empty dead place  there be no drink corner near the beach  the only place to go be have a walk at the crowded mall or go to movie

regency    no comment mjbijlee  no cap pls  live  let live   help live  
salary and allowances salary deduction for 3 days eid holiday i take a 2 week leave which coincide with the 3 day eid el fitr holiday in the middle  the company deduct my salary for these 3 day say that the holiday fell within my leave so i be not not entitle to it a paid holiday   is it true that the qatar labour law for this section have be interpret a such  
yes it correct  it be a public holiday so will not be entitle to receive any salary for these 3 day 
arabian princes  have n t you receive your full salary for the month of august  were you be pay for only 29 day  if so  good change the company  
 afsunder  you be entitle for that three day as well  according to my knowledge  no holiday be be exempt from salary other than   leave without pay     
yes  it correct qatar labour rule 
your company be wrong  they should not include the eid with annual leave or unpaid holiday  eid be public holiday and fully pay unless you work on eid and get over time for it  check with labor department  but i m certain on this  
what crap  eid be a fully pay public holiday  as legend say above   
if the three holiday be before the starting of your leave then you be entitle to get the salary  if those three holiday be at the end of your holiday then you be not entitle  in the second case you should have join at least the day before the eid holiday  in your case you be not entitle a the eid holiday be in the middle of your leave  
article  78  the worker shall be entitle to annually  leave with full wage a follow  1  three work day for eid ei fitr 2  three work day for eid al adha 3  one work day for the independence day 4  three work day to be specify by the employer  if the circumstance of the work require the employment of the worker during any such leave day the provision of article  75  of this law shall be apply to him  
raven  your profile show you be a manager and you dont know the company rule and regulation  eid holiday be fully pay public holiday if you be on the payroll  if you be work   you be temporarily out of the payroll when you be on leave even if it be a paid leave or unpaid leave  
dear cherukkan  your argument be exactly what the company tell me  but the basis of it   be it just a widespread uncontested practice  or be there any valid legal and statutory interpretation for it    
qatar living lounge help  talk to me about eid  i know it s a way off  but i would love to hear how people in qatar celebrate the holiday  i imagine it s more fun here than in the u s  for example  because qatar be a muslim country  does anyone have special tradition to commemorate the end of ramadan  i would like to profile some responder in a magazine i write for  let me know asap  thanks   
i remember my eid childhood  it be great  we d first meet up at my grandfather s home  we d all talk and the child would plan 3ayuding  we d all go from house to house  sing a song and look cute and be give 1 riyal  after go door to door  we d go back home and play until it be time to eat the large feast  parents would usually chat  families get together  people visit and they have some tea and snack  we pray  i love eid   cost of living  visas  safety info  tips on moving  facts  pictures  videos  and more  
we all qatari first go for the eid prayer then from there we directly move on to our grandfather or father to greet them of eid and sit for a while and have some eatable and go for sleep in there house 
i can understand your frustration  go to a clinic  have them inject you with something that would give you a comma until ramadan be over  otherwise  can i come to italy with you   ticket  hotel on you  ruffino on me   img nid 27385 title desc link none align left width 180 height 125  
oh oryx  you be so right  ramadan should be a month of less  material thing  and more  spirituality   for a lot it be  our schedule do not change much  eg  we do not eat all night which negate the point of fast in my opinion   we break our fast at sunset with a small light meal  then we have dinner in the evening  we get up before dawn for a small breakfast  we try to be good muslims in this month  in the hope we can carry this on throughout the year  i do see qatar change from when i be a child during ramadan  this be something to do with u  of course  and also the influx of expat   love be the answer  
we tend to do a bit of bake prior to eid  usually the night before  or earlier if you re really organise  we gather the kid around and make some biscuit and traditional sweet  these be then ready to distribute during the eid prayer and also to the neighbour  they be also really handy when people come to visit you during eid  what i ve notice here in qatar be that friend and neighbour seem to visit each other a lot more on eid than back home  i guess it s because we do n t have family here  so our friend tend to become our new support structure  on the 2 eids that i ve so far spent in qatar our new  tradition seem to be go to city centre and get some good sale item  lol i guess that s our variation on spend the day at the park  too hot  or visit the grandparent  too far  or stay at home  too bore   
eid be one of the main celebrating funtion in qatar and be celebrate with full of enthusiasm u find the road glitering with the light and in the evening u will find a very fine fireworks on the corniche side  
 be the only escape relaxation for those poor worker where they can socialize  wear colorful cloth  take photo to send to their family  feel human  in many country there be many national religious social holiday for the people  but here it be only those 3 4 day  or even 2 3 day    be strong but not arrogant be modest but not weak   s h  
not at all  holidays will start from 25th ramazabn to 5th day of eid i e atleast 9 holiodays  moreover just look at ramazan timing  school  only 4 30 hr office  only5 hr 
 i be talk here about the poor worker of private sector in real life  not the cyber govenment  semi government emplyees the 2 eieds per year would be either 2 3 or 3 4 day   be strong but not arrogant be modest but not weak   s h  
look  these poor worker be enjoy more at their work rather then get holiodays and move around 2 3 day be far enough for their enjoy coz they prefer to do work and earn more and more overtime and salary  
qatar living lounge fireworks at katara for eid  katara will be celebrate the upcoming eid al fitr holiday with firework  the cultural village will be host the explosion of light and color for four night  begin with the first day of eid  with a start at 8 30pm  the show will go on for 15 minute  will you be check them out  or be there something else you re keen to do this eid

tfs   so when exactly be the first day of eid

qatar living lounge how to go home without exit permit my sponsor be not willing to give me exit permit in the fear of my not return  i be about 3 year at qatar  and i want to go home on a vacation before eid  is there any way to go home without the exit permit from sponsor  i want to go home before eid  no matter what do it cost  even cancellation of my visa  thank you for your advice  
give your bos a resignation letter   
if so then resign and leave  or else convince your sponsor that you would be back  if here on work visa  one ca n t leave the country without exit permit  no other way  
deport 
exit permit be must while anyone leave doha  talk to your sponsor again  
you can go to indian embassy a the last resort 
may be i can talk to your sponsor  
a others have say the only way be to resign my man   
you have 7 day  you leave it a bit late to resign  no  if you be due to go home they have to give you a ticket  if not  then go to the labour department and report him  
mana  not everybody need exit permit  if you have multiple entry visa there be no need for exit permit  most people unfortunately do need exit permit  it s like keep somebody hostage  sad but true  
my sponsor be not willing to let me go in any way until all of my project be finish  can my embassy or the labor department help

car take to india i wish to take my car  toyota corolla 2003  to india  be it expensive  can any body explain what be the procedure please  
qatar living lounge shiping car from qatar to india i be use nissan altima for past two year  i be plan to settle back india  is it possible to ship my car to india  is it advisable  any one do early  
not advisible  but wait for others valualble suggestion  
you have many post discuss this matter on ql  try use search option or google to look for procedure and custom duty  in simple term  it not advisable to ship your car unless you have emotional attachment towards the same and do n t bother to spend good amount of time  money and effort behind it  
not possible unless you change it to right hand drive 
you will not be allow to import a left hand drive car to india  there be some who circumvent the custom act by import vehicle from japan rhd vehicle and get charge custom base on rate under transfer of residence  tr   not aware on those procedure  
do n t ship altima  instead go for some other model  anyway u hv to pay import duty  so y do n t pay for some big suv s   
forget it  you ll be pay through your nose  eye and whatever other hole you have for custom  for that money you might as well buy a decent car from india itself  
check india custom deptt website for late rule  they have mention it all  they do allow import of self use vehicle in case you be go permanantly  close rp  btw  a others say  it s not wise to transfer altima  you can get same kindaa car in same price  used one  consider heavy duty pay at suctom and charge for change lhd to rhd  however if you have someone know in custom  process may be quite easy  
i presume you have never been to india since you came here  you have selects of cars in india  taking a car back home will be the most regretable decession you have ever taken god bless you 
the car on indian road now   i be shocked each time i go  you can buy a brand new one with the money you be plan to fee into the pocket of the custom man  
yep  friend of mine return from mumbai say he can see a lot of bmw s audi s and merc s  i suppose these car be go cheap in india for everyone to be able to afford it  
moving to qatar shipments to qatar hello all  we be move to qatar in august  need advice on send 2 separate household good shipment  any comment on that  what be the document require to send a shipment  what be require to receive a shipment  any information on household shipment and regulation would be appreciate  thanks  fitri 
follow up the to previous  any idea the transit time for a container from houston to doha  how about the advisability of store shipment in doha  security an issue  thanks  
hey fitri  we move here oct 2004 from dallas and it take roughly 60 day for our furniture and household good to arrive  i m not sure about your second question  as far a i know the shipment make it way to u shortly after it arrive and have clear custom  so we never store it  i suppose it would have be nice to send it 2 month in advance of our arrival though  
thanks for the info  we will be send a shipment from china and then later another from houston  any idea what document be require for ship to and receive in doha  
i believe that the shipping company in the state coordinate with one of the local moving company and handle most of the paperwork  when our shipment arrive we simply have to find the move company here and give them a map on where to deliver the good  there may have be other step handle by my wife or her company  but it seem fairly straightforward  your employer and or move company should give adequate instruction  be aware that they may quarantine and return later anything that they think need to be review for content  like dvd s  vhs tape  book  cds etc  it seem our labeling of box help them in this effort and so some of our dvds that be in the labeled box arrive after quarantine while others that be just haphazardly pack be deliver on the first shipment  http  www xanga com bbetz 
unless thing have change  you will need a residence permit before you can bring in freight 
as far a i know certain item be not allow in the country and wo n t clear custom  eg  gamble item  fur  play card 
as far a i know certain item be not allow in the country and wo n t clear custom  eg  gamble item  fur  play card 
hi fitri  i be from india and have come in to doha 8 day back  the delay in the process be only at the level of the directore i m told  apparently once the good arrive in doha  the local agent contact custom and set a date with them to inspect the good  this take up to a week  after custom go through all item  they give their estimate and clearance  there be a tax of 5  on the good be bring in levied  however household good be exempt from the tax and the agent apply to the directorate for exeption  this be where take time and i m told can take upto 20  25 day to gte the clearance  thus the option seem to be to either pay 5  of the valuation they have do or wait  
hi everyones  thank you for the reply  we ve be talk with the hr services representative of my husban company and there be no problem to ship our good from two different country  and they will take care of everything so one problem be resolve and wait for the next thanks again  fitri 
hi bbetzinqat  just read about your experience with the dvds but be not sure i understand  are you say it be well to not label well and then the stuff wo n t be as likely to be quarantine  or vice versa  thanks  am go to be pack up this summer  aeroquilter

haha  so you want to get away without pay the loan  
not really  but iam just curious what if the company be the cause of termination  
yes  but your loan and contract be with the bank  
you mean even the cause of termination be the company  the bank will force me to pay   and wat if i find new job with less salary war will happen do they reduce my monthly fee  
i be sure you can renegotiate the repayment with the bank  
ah okay  because i be just worry  but not pay and run from my debt be not my option  i do believe in karma  thanks for the info  
you re welcome  i hope it all work out for you  
fact  if your company terminate you  take that letter to your bank  you wo n t be require to pay any remain amount  bank will use it tact  do n t yield  after few day of delay  finally you will get clearance from bank and fly home  insurer of your money  bank would pay that amount to bank  may be insurer and bank be have office in the same building  or manager be cousin  they be after your money  so escape clear from both party  pray hard  good luck in find another job soon somewhere  regards  
would you believe if i say 1000 have leave without repay a single coin in case your company terminate you  what for you pay premium every month my friend  
this be interesting  i do not know this  to be honest  i be surprised that this be possible  but good for those who have bank loan  
qatar living lounge tata safari in qatar why tata safari be not available in qatar   
that what be that the tata safari     
i will check with ratan tata and get back to you on this question  
co it s a piece of shhhhhhh   i guess there s no market for it  qatari s want quality car  
i dont think it be available in qatar  chk at the tata showroon in salwa road  
hmm for a second there  i think tata s do something crazy and actually launch the safari in qatar  its enough i saw a couple of scorpios on the road and i have to duck behind my steer wheel  thank god it isnt so   safari be only good for india  give the indians a feel for big car  good fortune always come knock at your door  when you be sh tting in the toilet         smoke     
if everyone buy tata safaris there would be less accident  no one would go fast enough to lose control and crash   
because you cant pay in rupees i guess           he who dares wins 
tata car do not have quality  none of them ever  the estate  sierra  safari  indica    avada kedavra  
 tata be know to be a business house with solid ethics  tata car have prove to be success in indian market  there indica be the only car in india which challenge the dominance of maruti suzuki 800  which be enjoy the maximum market share  tata nano have show to the world their engineering superiority  something even the germans or japanese couldn do  safari be a good vehicle  but the problem in qatar be  people be not hardworking enough to actually see which vehicle do well on road  they follow the crowd  n also there be blind follow of american brands n japanese  you sell a toy car label   make in america   and the so called qataries will buy tht in whole sale  to boast about tht fact tht they own american stuff   why you think skoda be not a much accept brad here very much like tata   first see the vehicle and then comment   if a vehicle can run on indian roads  sorry not roads  supposedly road  it can drive in any country   trust me    
i be ratan tata i not want to lonch in qatar   lol 
family life in qatar safety for woman hello  how safe be it for lady to move alone  do indian lady move freely and alone on their own or by public transport  taxi  we be use to uae life which we feel safe  is it comparable  thanks 
 this country be safe more than u think    drink beer save water    
i think u time go by qatar will be not safe u before  see a lot of rape case  shoot which it not publish in the newspaper  robbery etc  it evolution us the country expand and so be the crime  
safe in qatar as long a they carry a loaded ak 47 with them all the time  who say guns breed violence  
qatar be one of the safe country in the world  and what stupid comment be these  i feel like people on these forum just want to scare people away  s i ve pmed you a link with stats   i love qatar  http  www iloveqatar net 
news from qatar http  www gulf times com site topics article asp  cu 2  item 165242  version 1  template 36  parent 16 
qatar be no longer a safe place to live in when compare to what it be before  seeing be believe  the other day my wife be just wait for me to take the car out from the park area of our flat  she be stand inside the parking area but she be busy on her mobile  when a guy in a honda civic stop and ask her to hop in  do you call this safe  i have see this happen to so many woman in qatar  no one be try to scare away people it be the fact  please open your eye and dont go by statistic  
bibs  your topic message above be not really accurately describe safety in qatar  this instance  that happen with your wife  almost happen almost everywhere in other country  if i be take a cab in cairo  where i live  i will get ton of offer to hop into someone s car  not necessarily because i be pretty  but because girl be hit on generally speak  i ve be here in doha for a couple of year  with family or without  face the usual hassle  downsides  persistent car follower  at mall guy throw their cell phone number at girl  in bar some guy impose themselves  but usually there be guard  on the beach guy stare and offer company with no pressure  on the cornich  for long walk  jogging and workout  guy may try to talk to her  but if the girl be serious enough  no one can catch up with here speed to begin with  unless he be a highly athletic trainer or something   generally men stare  specifically from certain down trodden ex pats from some least deve   
in the last 4 year i have go to the vegetable market  the souqs the corniche and everywhere in between many time alone  i be a blond decent look westerner  have i get star at  always and it creep me out  but never have i felt unsafe  i keep my head up  walk fast and in a confident manner  no one would dare mess with me be my attitude  it seem to work so far  
what u should have do be  u should have go to that civic guy  spit on his face and bang him nicely coz he he deserve it very well if u ignore such  they wouldnt change and others would become like him  
i be more than surprised to see all these comment  live and work in qatar a a blond woman  i have to admit i have never encounter any of the above mention  even go to the fruit and vegetable market  where in any case  it be much good if you have company with you  not because people stare  but they be use to deal with men a mostly on friday the men do the shopping  wherever you go  if they recognise you be foreigner   because you be different  they will look at you and the inflation will rise 200  in every shop  at least they will try   qatar be no different than any other country but a lot more safe if you behave naturally you will not be molest  one thing more  on the street it be very much a man  world and your will see relatively few woman go alone shopping  so for many people this be really strange  i go to a small supermarket nearly everyday to buy milk and the boy insist on carry the one bottle to my car  this alway make me feel foolish a i be   
working in qatar  driving license hi everyone  i be plan to move to qatar next month  can anybody tell me what be the system for a newcomer on   driving license    is it that one have to pass a rigorous drive test and then he be ussied a drving license for a fee even though he possess a driving license of his home country  rgds asd  
i think it depend on where your original driver license be from  i think people from the states  uk  south africa  canada and probably others can just convert there old license to a local qatar driving license  you just need to do an eye test  
get an international dr lic before you come  it will be good till you get your rp and a qatari lic 
is any member of this site be work with qp  how be their work culture  rgds asd  india 
hi folks  i be start work in doha in august and i be wonder if anyone know if it be possible to transfer my uae license to a qatar one  my canadian license have long since expire  but i have be on my uae license for the past 5 year  i would rather not deal with the hassle of redo my canada license this summer  but i bet it would be simple than do the qatari drive exam  anyone have any experience with this  cheers  
i be not sure about people from the uk asthey be drive on the left hand side of the road  however  there be other ex pats here who be drive they will probably know about it  i convert mine from the uae a i ca n t find my european license and that go no bother at all  
first of all you have to get your residence permit  afterwhich you can apply for a qatar drive license  if you already have a driving license from your country  take note that most of the western country they will just convert it  no need for you to take up the test or go to a driving school  if your license be from asia  it depend  but most of the asian license you have to undergo a driving test  signal  l and pocket parking  road test  or the traffice department will suggest on your application form to go to a driving school for two week  hope this help 
as far a i know  there s no problem with you convert a uae license to a qatari one  i know a lot of people have do it the only test you will have to undergo be the eye test  and they will be more than happy to convert your license to a qatari one   
you can drive on a international driver for six month no problem and when you do a visa run it start again 
i have a omani license and no rp a it be take time  i go to traffic department and they give me a temp license after eye test and say once you get rp we will convert that into permenant license  as far a i know and i might be wrong if you come to qatar on residence visa you can only drive for 7 day before convert your license into qatari  temp  visit visa be another story beast666 
thanks beast666  rgds asd

i be give you the figure which may give you an idea about cost of living here  hope this will help you to calculate your mothly saving and expect salary  housing rent be exorbitantly high in qatar  if you want decent place to live then you have to be ready to spend around 7500 to 9500  qar  per month  for 2 persons 8  500 house rent  furnished  1  800 groceries  misc exps  1  600 car hire  or loan installment  petrol 33 land line rent 50 mobile rent or prepaid card 150 water charges 150 electricity 200 internet at home 75 television channel connection 120 voip call card to call home country 200 car insurance  2500 12  if you own your car  12  878 total one time exps  1  000 deposit for water connection 1  000 deposit for ele  connection 7  500 house rent deposit 2  000 driving classes fees  appx   250 one time mobile activation charges  11  750 total

wow  complete detail from geechee  u must put a consultancy firm thanks 
room for 4  000 not flat small flat start at 6  000 
i think it will depend on what kind of lifestyle you want here  what nationality be you  if you be western i would say you wont save much out of 20k  you would want a decent apartment  villa  good social life  weekend away  if you be the sort of person who be just come here to work work work  then you will be able to save more  it will be trial and error until you find the balance that suit you and the lifestyle you want to have

i see a lot of people have already write a reasonable answer  but keep in mind following   about flat or car rental  depends who negotiate  if a european person or a westerner in general  forget it to find those rate  for them everything be double   a many have mention  depend on lifestyle  for example one of the most difficult issue for woman here  to find a normal hairdresser  beautician  etc  usually too expensive and very low quality  level of hygiene  if you go to a normal place  price be ridiculous for what you get

qatar living lounge  traffic in india v traffic in doha i be curse here many time for be   racist   when i say that the big danger on the road be bus  truck and bike driver from subcontinent  just watch this video  http  www youtube com watch  v rjreqag5jpm they come to doha use to drive and walk like this  no lane  no rule  no traffic light  and continue behave exactly the same way on the street of doha  ca n t wait for the police to enforce the new traffic rule   
i will personally make up flask of tea  after iftar   and take biscuit to the traffic police so they will enforce the rule and do n t need to go off and get a cuppa  i be sure i be not the only person really hop that these rule will be enforce to the max  terramax i totally agree  
at least we have a road network n in all that chaos there be a system n we don t have much accident http  www youtube com watch  v ag9jwwkv2ru  mode related  search  http  www youtube com watch  v t54jhkr1jz8 if you ca n t change your fate  change your attitude  
some more for u to ponder ppl who stay in glass house should not throw stone at others http  www youtube com watch  v gga9nbx8ezc if you ca n t change your fate  change your attitude  
agree with you terramax  should n t i migrate to brazil now  i love the samba and footballer there  
note one more thing in that indian  video terramax  just observe the speed of vehicle  not more than 30 40 i be afraid and not a single 4x4 drive  now imagine the same thing on doha or brazil road with all suvs with speed over 120  just imagine  you can even add drunk driver from another video and watch the fun  with tea and biscuit   img nid 22259 title fruity kitty desc link none align left width 135 height 180  
 t  i agree there be a system  but this be your system and it work there  the fact that a majority of the driver on the road be from subcontinent  do n t mean they can bring their   system   with them  lara123  there be enough brazilian football player in doha  but definitely much less than indian driver  btw  i see no point in you guy attack brazilians  for your info  i be not a brazilian   pointing finger will not change the fact that the majority of the driver on the doha road be your compatriot  and the   industrial    especially those who drive white tata bus with worker  driver should n t be give license even to walk   
shreeya  sure  that s my point as well  they behave same here  i e  drive 40 without observe lane  turn where they want to  without indicate  jaywalk in the middle of the road  so when someone  not only a suv at 120  but a car driving at 60 to 80 come  the accident be inevitable  just go to najma in the end of the day to see the same  there be even kid play in the middle of the street  
u r wrong driver here adder to the rule n speed limit of qatar n talk of walking  u wont see much from the subcontinent ppl jay walking in the middle of the road  next time open your eye n u will know who r jay walk n talk of play on the road indian parent never allow their child to go out without supervision leave alone play your view r so distorted this be why we have label u racist  n last of all if u r not from brazil plz do change your profile be proud of your country n not sham of it if you ca n t change your fate  change your attitude  
terramax  people from all country be reside in najma area  there be pionys  pakistanis  bangladeshis  somalians  egyptians and all others    why to blame it on only indian driver  the road be so conjusted with the unique beautiful design of biiiiig roundabout and smaaaaal circulate road  still i be yet to observe any big accident on these road  believe me a i be a daily commuter on these road  you have to agree the fact that behind every accident there be a suv  fortunately not drive by subcontinent driver   img nid 22259 title fruity kitty desc link none align left width 135 height 180  
terramax why be you to be tell my sister to see your child    hai your child not to be play on road only in my village same to same happen  okay and you be to be see this circus of india people on which which roads i be to be very much interesting in circus also tell tell now

moving to qatar mixed sex accommodation hi everyone  i m male  and live in a house share with another male  a female friend from home have say she d like to move out here to look for work  we have a spare room  is she legally allow to occupy it  
no    aal izz well  
nop                           teach me rules i ll teach you how to break it rms  
 legally no  but there be accomodations that be mixed  however if you get catch  then you ll be in big trouble                              we live life forward  but understand it backward    
no much trouble  the very next day  you can visit your home country                              teach me rules i ll teach you how to break it rms  
big trouble a in maybe lose your her job and get deport  hopefully  no lash  maybe can plead for leniency but then again  ignorance of the law be no defense generally  rentals have  be come down  better to stay on her own or find other female friend to share accommodation with   beauty lie in the eye of the beerholder  
noooooooooooo never do dat 
it be big no    in qatar 
 know lot of people of the opposite gender share accommodation  what s the problem  like if there be a choice  i understand be thousand unit be available in different area  for affordable prices  but since qatar can not provide a normal level of affordable house  no point to demand to follow certain rules  do you know how hard to find a house for let s say single western female  next to impossible  all be either   for male    or for   indian    or for   filipino    so what this western lady should do  if she for example can not afford or simly do n t want to pay a fortune for little miserable independent cage   when at the same time she can find nice room in share with male villa for half price  eh     what lie behind u and what lie before u be small compare to what lie within u    oliver wendell holmes

qatar living lounge islam and sport  a question from non muslim  i have be follow up the world championship in artistic gymnastics  and then there be a picture of a qatari gymnast aljazy al habshi http  www minkusimages de img mi077 jpg just would like to understand how do it comply with islamic rule of woman cover body and hair  or be this girl violate the religious rule  would like to get an answer from our fellow qataris  please  
it s really up to the individual  imho  she could have extend the leotard down to the knee and cover her head with the same outfit material to be a little more covered  conservative muslims would probably say that she should be fully cover in loose clothing with head cover  she obviously felt comfortable compete like that   love be the answer  
fully cover in loose clothing on a beam would be a straght way to a serious injury  but  how come  two extreme from gymnastic leotard in public to veil cover face and it be all up to the individual  why no qatari wear swimsuit on the beach then  
there be qatarias who choose not to wear abaya and shayla  who s to say she do  there be also qatarias who wear swimsuit in public  matter of choice  pm  you can get swimsuit material in the souq and have a tailor make up a burkini to your specification  think i saw some in souq al dira before the summer   love be the answer  
so excited to hear that  would love to see some of the design in the shop here   love be the answer  
lady for a while i have be think with qatar promote sport why dont vcu or somebody push design in muslim friendly sportswear  who ever open a trendy shop sell this i think would make a lot of money  
good idea  oryx  i thik there s definitely a gap in the market for ready make modest swimwear here for mixed swimming pool  thought here be more ladies fitness centre open up with swimming pool  i go to see at the opening of it and the lady be wear regular swimming costume   love be the answer  
we have such islamic friendly swimsuites in egypt so it be not really something new  a for the question  i do n t think that any muslim  conservative or not  can claim that what she be wear comply with the rule of islam  but of course she be free to choose  and abviously she do  by the way my sister wear a bikini  so please do n t bombard me with accusation of be retard bla bla bla

politics un move to protect gay  transgender in a late move  the united nations continue it march to further add homosexuality and transgender to it list of human right  is the un go too far  and what do this mean for country that condemn these thing a unacceptable to their culture  will the un of the future start put such nation on it pariah list  http  www chicagonow com trans girl cross 2012 11 united nations protect transgender  
i wish the un would show the same concern for all the child be murder in gaza  
mn  but a for now un s main concern and priority be to protect gayz  transgenders    
 france be allow   mosque for gay    so it s only a matter of time before it use it security council seat to push for this elsewhere  it s a brave new world  http  www albawaba com editorchoice france mosque gay 452009  
good on the un  nobody deserve to be persecute  
would openly list country where homosexuality be outlaw to be a vagabond nation  the matter of homosexuality be by far a much dispute affair among people of various religion  creed and race  that to simply state it s right and all those who condemn it for any reason be wrong  will not be as simple  that say if they wish to protect those who be gay and transgenders from oppression and mistreatment then i suppose they have all the liberty to do so  however yes they should also then open their eye to all the oppression commit around the world at large  and work towards stamp them out  and not just pick and choose to their convenience which have clearly be the case with un in the recent time  which have cause people around the globe to hold them in contempt for  and not take them seriously  
yes  the un for push for equality and freedom  should it put non compliant nation on a pariah list  no  
 does the un have a pariah list that they add country s who commit human right violation to  or will they just add   persecution of homosexual and transgenders   to their report on various country   
marco but what about the gay and transgenered arab in gaza  who will speak for them  
of course they must have the same right a all other people  after all  they be human and they be people  what difference do their sexuality make  they be still human  
i agree fatimah  but if the un say homosexuality be a human right  then they ll list country that persecute gay right along those that deny press freedom and get involve with human trafficking  etc  qdclover  there be no gay in gaza

qatar living lounge  hall pass and relationship  this be a new one to me  apparently  if your relationship be in a rut  then one idea be to issue your partner with a   hall pass    this allow him her a few day of freedom to do whatever they want  no question ask  sounds dangerous to me  but what say you  would you issue your partner with a   hall pass     
 no  since when do   do what ever you want   help to fix a relationship  it s just carte blanche for cheat  and cheat make thing bad  not well  imho  
if it s in a rut  just trash  
brit be ask if you d issue your partner one  not for personal use    
if you be in a relationship  then that in itself assume certain boundries  so  in reality  you can not or should not do whatever you want  
if the hall pass  be for them to go on the lash or a weekend away with mate or some r  r away from stress  then sure he could have a hall pass  as long a i get one too  if it be a pass  for infidelity  then no  
http  watchnewfilms com movie php  id 7362 just a concept think up by someone to sell movie ticket  the movie be rather funny  link above 
one should always be able to do what one want to do  even if one be in a relationship  if it be a good relationship  one will not feel that there be uncomfortable restriction  being in a relationship should not mean one have to give up one life or personality  if it feel that way  then maybe one be with the wrong partner  
agree with no merci  could not have put it good myself  
 the   hail pass   give you carte blanche without any question  so it be different from be able to do thing freely within a relationship  at an extreme case  the hall pass allow you to have sex with someone else without be question   
no way jose  if you do n t suffocate your partner in the fitst place they wo n t feel the need for a hall pas  if my hubby even think about suggest this  i d be on the first flight back to london  
qatar living lounge friend with benefit   guy  do you think this will ever work out without issue

qatar living lounge prostitution thread what happen here  seems to me some of u be have a sensible discussion about prostitution in qatar and the thread vanish    am i miss something  i do not see anything deserve of sensoring editing unless we look at the original post  and i be sure that could have be deal with seperately and so keep the thread alive   or be it be imply that we bury our head in the sand and pretend it do not exist here  can we continue here         
it s not that china  it be delete because the thread be troll and promote prostitution  such thread that promote something whether it be prostitution or otherwise get delete  but it be n t cause of the topic itself so we can continue here    
that s why it be delete  i be the one who report it to qatari  nevertheless the thread be become interesting  i m sorry   may the roof above u never fall in  and may the friend below never fall out  
so let s talk about it here     i m surprised that prostitution be that open in what be consider a conservative country  i mean if it s so obvious that these woman be prostitute them  then i m sure authority know about it  the question be  why be n t they do anything about it  
ok  thats understandable  thank you  it also underline mir83 and my point that we believe prostitution be less tolerable here in qatar  however  the fact remain that prostitution be wide spread in certain place in qatar and thrives  until something be say by somebody  and then the routine mass deportation take place  it go quiet for a while  and then the night girl  start build up in number again to the level they be now  my last sentence  before the previous thread be delete be something like this  mark my word  the lady will vanish any day now  over the few week after that  their number will slowly increase again  and the cycle repeat it s self   obviously somebody be behind this  a pimp   a a sponsor for these girl  
if someone be actually behind this  which i believe so   it have to be someone in a high position  someone who have control over authority  what other explanation be there for the lack of action by the authority  
cornellian  somebody answer this on the previous thread just before it be delete  i can not recall the poster  but it be suggest that some body in authority  possible with some wasta  to throw around  be probably behind it  my apology if i have not recall what be say precisely  but i would go along with that theory anyway  there be just far too many girl  far too often  in so many place for it to be anything else  unless somebody know differently ofcourse        
look like we be on the same wave length here  i would guess that the authority be bending  to a certain extent under the threat of this person s  wasta  the final breaking point be probably reach when the religious fraternity start to object speak out  
arrrggghhhh my country be go to the dog   oh well you know what they say  if you cant beat em join em  jk  p 
 but if that   pimp   be powerful enough to keep the authority quiet  then he must be powerful enough to keep the religious fraternity too  i think no matter what anyone say or do  prostitution will always exist everywhere  because there will always be woman who need the money and men who be ready to pay   
who join who  do u acknowledge what china syndrome say  i mean a your point of view a a local  
qatar living lounge saturday night in doha  qube nightclub  hi all  me and some friend from london be look to come over to doha for a couple of week  whats the party scene like on friday and saturday night  i hear that in qatar nobody go out on saturday  be that true  where would you go for rnb and hiphop  and ive heard alot about a club call qube be it any good  any feedback would be welcome thanks  
if you enjoy filipino cover band and lot of asian variety in the crowd then the qube be great  however if you enjoy more of the western flair you be down to garvey s  rugby club  and rydges  of these your best bet for fri and sat night  my opinion  so no flame from anyone  be go to be rydges  the bar be under new aussie management with the goal of much good music and faster service  this past weekend be quite busy and the music be good enough to dance to  so there you hav it  one recommendation 
go to beirut  thats where the clubing be i always tell the truth  even when i lie 
is pretty good on a thursday night  nice crowd of people and a good british band  not club though  for club there be only the pearl  with the awful dj jojo  and cloud nyn where the crowd be very very young  i guess if you want club you really do have to go to beirut  
 not good idea to come to have a party in qatar  qatar be a   muslim   country  muslims be not allow to drink alcohol  be in unnecessary co ed place  coming to qatar to have party be strange  maybe you could save money for other purpose other than party   
i agree with tyler and bbksiu  although the best way to enjoy your weekend in doha be by get together with friend in one of our house  have dinner  bbq  and drink  alcohol  you can buy alcohol if you have the license  play some game  e g  risk and card  watch the late dvd  you can put music on and dance  becareful your neighbor      and if you too drink to go home  your friend can get you a lift  or there always a taxi  so you not worry to get cought on drunk and driving  
someone agree with me  that never happen  perhaps i take my mediaction today and have a rare lucid think  p 
 amaru immortal  clubs  i mean night club  here in qatar be no comparison to what you d find in a non muslim country  they both serve alcohol  have music  live djs  but that s where the comparison end    where would you go for rnb and hiphop    take a plane and go somewhere else     i d suggest heat or mercury lounge in melbourne for rnb hip hop      bit of promotion from an ex employee  if you still wan na come to the middle east for clubbing  go to beirut or istanbul  maybe even cairo for that matter  or go to goa  india if you wan na spend xmas at trance party on the beach  or go pub hopping in bangalore    i hear that in qatar nobody go out on saturday  be that true    true  we go out on thursdays  that s the weekend here  happy hour start at 5 30pm   
it suck 
thanks for the info  i have friend in doha and they say that there be a rumour that two top london djs  one playing hiphop rnb the other playing house will be perform  if anyone have far info that would be great  
for the coolest and the noisy place in doha  qube be the place    they ve get the crowd with the ohh la la band    check this out  www mocha com ph they be the performer

unless ur visa be not print on passport  u can easily change a sposor  no need of noc   many people do not know this procedure and stick with the job  the only thing be that they may charge ur flight  visa exp  from ur settlement  i slightly differ with mr  hr manager  u can protect the employer s interest by penalize the guy the money they spend for employ these people  many unlucky guy land here with bad employer without fulfillig promise and unsuitable working environment which may compell them to leave  so let them leave and search for something they they feel good  
hi  this be not fair with your company now unless they do n t give you the agree salary  just make sure your passport be with you  
visas and permits changing your profession on residence visa my profession show in my residence visa be technician whereas in reality i be work a manager  i try to change my profession from technician to manager through our agent but for some reason he be say it be not possible  i have masters in business administration and masters in geology  i really wonder why this change ca n t be do  does any body have any suggestion of how to do this change  
to change the profession there be a charge of qr 550  he do n t want to pay for it that be the reason   
i do hav the same issue  it take my company mre tan a yr to get the profession change  ive also herd tat recently  they have put a report state it not possible to change the profession  im not sure of this  
my cmpny agree to change my prof  dnt knw how long will it take  but ofcos it be possibl wit high edu certficts  every lady hop that her daughter will marry a good man than she do  and be convince that her son will never find a wife as good a his father do    
i be ready to pay for the charge even it be 3000 qr so money be not a problem here but our sponsor here be say that immigration be reject the application for profession change 
 i use to be an electrician in my visa a we dont have a visa for professional way back in 2005  now it be stamp accord to what i do now in our company  it take them 2 week ot process it  they submit my authenticated diploma and noc from my employer    fascinated with supercars but can t afford it yet  so i settle down for a humble jeepney  proud noypi     
you can do it on your visa renewal  just submit your certificates diplomas  they have to change it for you  unless the company do n t have a visa for the certain positions nationals  coz before issue visa on particular name  company have to get an aproval for the certain nationality and position  and then they apply your name to this visa  
i have my profession change upon my renewal  but not the exact profession accord to my diploma since the company have no available visa for such position  i be plan to have it change again on my next renewal  i think i ve discover the secret of life  you just hang around until you get use to it  charles schulz 
it be important  get an noc from sponser  first get the application form for profession change  get your sponser sign  seal on that paper then goto labour dept  near to american hosp  along with  1  sponser id copy 2  munciplaity bill 3  edu  qual copy  should be transalted  4  bank stmt  6 month  5  aggriment contract  3 new   newly print  6  aggriment contract  3 old  already sign  7  your pp  visa and id copy  submit this and get sign from officer he be sit in 3rd floor  once you get the sign goto the near office for attestaion of your contract   new 3   while attestation you have to pay 50 qr  wait for another 10 day and get immigration office  garaffa  and show your receipt from labour by show them the new application for id change with your photo  then go buiding no  1 and submit your application there  you have to pay 300 qr  on the spot you will get your new id and visa sticker on your pp  go ahead good luck for you  i just change recently

visas and permits medical examination info  hi all  i finish my medical exam here in doha  i would like to know besides hiv and tb  be there any other disease check in the medical examination  im only interest in the disease that will make me fail the exam  and how many day or week will the result will be available  thanks 
sif you work in the admin job then u only need to check hiv and ptb result after 3 working day  if you work a a medical  paramedical or any food handler job  you also need to check hepab and hepac   
im an i t  guy so guess i dont have to worry about hepa  what about other std disease  do they check those  
but try to be clear from all these before come here  welcome to qatar  
is the medical exam result always take 3 work day  beacuse my colleague do the fingerprinting 2 week after his medical exam and he say the medical exam result take 2 week  and the only thing for him to know if he pass the medical exam be because he do the fingerprinting process  and be there anyway to know if you pass the medical exam  
once you be do w  ur medical exam you can check w  the medical commission at least after 3 working day  just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you ll get to know if it ready or not  for a medical employee it usually take about 2 wks to have the result do due to other test  e i  creatinine test  that have to be send to hmc for investigation  in your case  you be only require to undergo blood test  hiv   chest x ray  ptb   so i think it wont take long that much  dont you have mandoop representative for your company  he be suppose to follow up all these thing and you can always check w  him  good luck  
thanks apple for always reply on my post  another thing  after medical will i immediately go for fingerprinting or it will be for another week or so  
yes  you can do the fingerprint immediately  so  just relax everything will be ok   
everyone be check for hepatitis c  not just those in medical or food business  after the medical your sponsor be alert via sm about the result  pass fail  assuming all be good next be fingerprint and after that your residence permit can be process  
so if it s find positive do can one obtain iqama  
no  any positive in any of the 3 test and you re denied residency and send back whence you come

qatar living lounge atheists ii does be an atheist make you a less person  some look at atheist in a not so good way  some even avoid talk to them and worst some judge them for their belief  
depends  i would say the preachy type be a pain  just like any other organised movement   
 which be well  do something good because you want it to  and your motivation be your innate goodness  or do something good because you be oblige to  and your motivation be your longing for an eternal life    jack frost vs jack cool    
well i would say goodness from the heart be always good than goodness by obligation  but goodness be goodness in any shape or form  imho  
 some follower of some church give donation  and want their name to be mention before the mass  only few want to remain anonymous    jack frost vs jack cool    
does be religious make you a less person  some look at religious people in a not so good way  some even avoid talk to them and worst some judge them for their belief  it go both way hun  the truth be you would not be able to tell the difference between a religious person or an atheist unless they mention it first  
 it be more important if god recognize you         dgoodrebel will always be the rebellious good one    
i care about a person base on their person  not their belief  grant last thing i want to hear be preach  but if someone be try to convert rather than accept the way i be  i do n t constitute them a a good person   
 very well say samael  i be with you on this one  but reality bite  narrow minded people tend to judge those who do n t believe in god  as if they be the devil themselves    jack frost vs jack cool    
i would say  to each his own  i agree  there be so many narrow mind person who tend to judge others too quickly  if i may say so  why do n t they look first at themselves before bash people  mitzzyy mitz 09 
 be also to accept his or her belief  accepting mean respect his her belief  it s how to deal with them civilly  you need to accept the person a a whole and not what you want to believe in him her only  you can not deal with that person truthfully    dgoodrebel will always be the rebellious good one    
qatari culture qatari s attitude towards expat women  why  iam here in qatar for about 6  1 2 year  many people have say to me that they be happy about the qatari youngster attitiude towards the woman because these guy be not star at our wife  daughter in a bad sense like we experience in our country  do you think it be right  if yes no then why  
yes it be right  qataris be interested in arabic lady or any lady expose her body openly   i have see them follow only arabic ladies  they just stare at western ladies  
 depends what you consider   a bad sense    while a lot of religion s claim that lust be some sort of a sin  without it the human race would be in dire trouble a no one would procreate  people lust after people they perceive a fertile and viable for successful procreation  it s actually a biological form of flattery   
most qatari like qatari lady but some like and desire non qatari women  
as good a it may seem that qataris do n t look lustfully after expat woman  you ca n t judge the human mind  
 so who actually star in a   bad sense     
qatari s be more into glamour and dreamy stuff  which u will find alot in the arab female unlike the asian lady  just to update 90  of arab lady will not step out of their house without make up and well dress even if it for buy a bottle of water form a mall  they have to maintain there class   and not the least they want attention from other ppl  so it a mind plan which be insist the arab guy to check em out 
i mean  come onnnn  like who care just ignore  it s different from case to case  plus starnig  sadly  be not consider a rude in the arab world  fact  take it easy and act like you do n t notice  like they re invisible   img nid 7232 title dua desc amen    link none align left width 440 height 56  
i think you have to honest to yourself in every aspect of life  even if it concern your true feeling  hiding something be a sin  lets say you feel lustful and  
almost 6yrs here and have find that qatari men generally be very polite charming smell good respectful giggly 
i always have a feeling that i have qatari blood in me   
qatar living lounge sharia and arabic in expat school today s gulf times carry an article where recommendation be make to make arabic language and sharia compulsory in curriculum of all expat school in qatar  how do ql ers with school go kid feel about this  make your opinion heard  
expat school here  at least the western one  do teach arabic  and islamic study  islamic study only for muslims  of course  they also teach qatari history  and that be mandatory for all student  well  at least the school my child go to do  i do not know about the non western expat school  
they should do that  why should i care about be he muslim or not u come to a muslim country islamic country nothing be gon na happen to ur dear child if he learn somethign except christianity  maybe it will be too much for their ignorant brain but it should be like that  i be bear in germany and i go to church and i go to religious class like all the other kid do  if u dont like it here u can leave but the minimum of respect be to send the child to learn about sharia and arabic  arabic be the language of the past and of the future but i know where their problem is affraid ur chidlren will convert will like it  
arabic be a very good idea since it be the local language  not so sure about sharia  why should non muslim kid   there be thousand of them here right   be force to study sharia     
the way i look at it be like this  my child be enrol in a western school  my child be not muslim  of course he should learn about islam  but not a something he need to submit to  but something he should have knowledge about  the same go for sharia law  we do indeed live in an islamic country  so it be important to be familiar with islam  i like that arabic be teach  the more language a person know  the good  the only problem i have be that so far all the arabic teacher we encounter be totally useless  
study arabic or islamic study  which i understand from a qatari friend include an introduction to sharia   after all  be n t the basis of education to prepare one for life by provide a broad based foundation from which one can later choose a specialty to focus on  besides  i think this be implement from last year by the moe  
hey here be my best friend put his nose again in everything  how r u today dear  how be ur scarecrow     
arabic  sharia law  qatar history plus islamic history should be teach at all school a a compulsory subject to muslim student  optional to non muslims  only if they wish to  
isobel say r e  in order to teach religion effectively there have to be comparative  what i mean by this  when explain to child the various nuance of religious belief one have to show a comparative and what that comparative mean to that particular religion  if we be go to go down the route of teach religion in this country we be go to have teach all religion  in order to get the history  culture and meaning of what each religion mean to that particular one and how in some case some religion be tie to each other through geographical circumstance and culture and how indeed they come to be that religion  there will have to be healthy debate and in some case at high school level  debate a in e g  islam and christianity  would that work  i think in ex pat school it may but in some local private school  i doubt it  however  if by religious education they mean tell a few story from koran to incite a healthy interest in the local religion  it could work   
 i ca n t think of a good argument against learn the language of one s host nation  provide  a isobel say  that a student can handle the academic rigor of such a class   sharia  i d personally have a problem with that be mandatory  because sharia be a code of law base upon a specific religion  it would only be acceptable to me if it be teach a an elective comparative law class  say  for high school student  then it would be appropriate  if instead of sharia  you mean they should be teach all child islamiyat islamic studies class  then you d get a vehement no from me  unless you re go to couch it in a   comparative religion   class that everyone have to take  then why should my child have to sit through a class that will amount to nothing more than religious indoctrination to a faith that i do n t subscribe to  i would be more than happy for my child to take a class on   history of the middle east and the islamic world   or   arab cultural study    and much like an a    
yup you do it  but make it optional please  
politics the most powerfull muslim country  who  the one still resisting or the ones waiting for get resisted   
it be always the lost that need my guidance 
 y   u wan na revolt against it     d noms    before god we be all equally wise  and equally foolish    albert einstein

welcome to qatar which come first  chicken or egg  q301 
turtle 
then u tell me which come first mango or mango tree 
omlet  
its all or somewhere there in evolution 
man or women  
 the chicken or the egg causality dilemma arise from the expression   which come first  the chicken or the egg    chickens hatch from egg  but egg be lay by chicken  make it difficult to say which originally give rise to the other  to ancient philosopher  the question about the first chicken or egg also evoke the question of how life and the universe in general begin  1 cultural reference to the chicken and egg intend to point out the futility of identify the first case of a circular cause and consequence   
 in a manner of avoid the question or joking  it can be say that   the chicken   come first in the structure of the question  simply because the word   the chicken   be say before the word   the egg   when the question be ask  in a question that be phrase differently  the answer would be different  similarly  randy garner jokingly refer to an encyclopedic solution   18   these supporter call attention to the merriam webster collegiate dictionary  2001   upon careful examination of the entry and accompany definition  one can accurately assert that chicken  be find on page 232  while egg  be not find until page 398  therefore  accord to this argument  chicken clearly come before egg    
created by god  the way he have create all of u  but where be he  we all be still in search of him in churches  mosques  temples  but he remain in our heart  always  
chicken come with egg  
of course chicken because the first chicken which come it didn t come from the egg there be some evolution then the chicken have change and change till the time chicken start to come from the egg

i think it depend on where your original driver license be from  i think people from the states  uk  south africa  canada and probably others can just convert there old license to a local qatar driving license  you just need to do an eye test  
get an international dr lic before you come  it will be good till you get your rp and a qatari lic 
is any member of this site be work with qp  how be their work culture  rgds asd  india 
hi folks  i be start work in doha in august and i be wonder if anyone know if it be possible to transfer my uae license to a qatar one  my canadian license have long since expire  but i have be on my uae license for the past 5 year  i would rather not deal with the hassle of redo my canada license this summer  but i bet it would be simple than do the qatari drive exam  anyone have any experience with this  cheers  
i be not sure about people from the uk asthey be drive on the left hand side of the road  however  there be other ex pats here who be drive they will probably know about it  i convert mine from the uae a i ca n t find my european license and that go no bother at all  
first of all you have to get your residence permit  afterwhich you can apply for a qatar drive license  if you already have a driving license from your country  take note that most of the western country they will just convert it  no need for you to take up the test or go to a driving school  if your license be from asia  it depend  but most of the asian license you have to undergo a driving test  signal  l and pocket parking  road test  or the traffice department will suggest on your application form to go to a driving school for two week  hope this help 
as far a i know  there s no problem with you convert a uae license to a qatari one  i know a lot of people have do it the only test you will have to undergo be the eye test  and they will be more than happy to convert your license to a qatari one   
you can drive on a international driver for six month no problem and when you do a visa run it start again 
i have a omani license and no rp a it be take time  i go to traffic department and they give me a temp license after eye test and say once you get rp we will convert that into permenant license  as far a i know and i might be wrong if you come to qatar on residence visa you can only drive for 7 day before convert your license into qatari  temp  visit visa be another story beast666 
thanks beast666  rgds asd

in my opinion yes you can drive  even tourists without philippine driver license can at least for a week upon arrival  renewal of license now be much faster  just go to any lto on mall like sm sn fernando pampanga  they have kiosk just for renewal  what i know you can get it after an hour or two  goodluck 
apply for international licence which be for 100 riyal

dude  i come here on a visit visa  screw the car rental  you think they know anything  i go to traffic department and ask   1  not all international license be valid  only one from certain country and they have to come with a booklet that contain a card   2  no matter what your status be  it be allow to drive on it for 2 week from the time you enter the city  after 2 week if you get into an accident  it be your fault no matter what  car rental do n t tell you these thing because you be buy their insurance anyways   3  international license mean nothing without your original license from back home  when you want to make the qatar license  you need your original license from back home and it have to be recognize so that you do n t go through the driving test in here

hehe  good one qatari  yeah  n most importantly respect other ppl on the road     dont ask me but thats a long topic  all of u who drive here know exactly wot i mean     
if it parallel parking i can tell you what my drive instructor teach me  drive up parallel to the car in front of the spot you want to park in  about a foot away from it  reverse straight until you can see the boot of the other car through the back door window then turn the steering wheel and straighten it back up a you move  when the back  driver side corner of your car be in line with the car behind you  turn the wheel the other way and viola   you slide right in  
if browswork think that he can trick his way on a driving test do we really want to see him on the road drive  
first prepare yourself and ignore the police when he shout so you do n t feel nervous  make sure you do n t knock over any pole  begin reverse 2 inch away from the pole in your right hand side  when you do n t see the first corner of the pole of the parking box cover by the part of the car  take a full turn to the right  adjust your mirror on the left hand side down to see the white line  then reverse slowly  when you see the white line in the middle of the leave back wheel  take a full turn to the left then move slowly then you will be inside the pocket parking  i hope it help    do unto others  what you want to do unto you    kiarajane  gmail com

advice and help is qatar license valid in uae  hi to everyone just to correct is qatar dl convertible to uae dl  or we have to give some test there  my friend want to shift to dubai on residence permit 
it be valid a few year ago  i do n t know if thing be change now  
its valid  depend upon the type of your residence permit  if you have a permanent residence then you need to have uae d l  but on a visit visa you can easily use your qatari lic  never ask for a smile just give it  
well i ask the wrong question is qatar dl convertible to dubai dl  my friend want to shift to dubai on residence permit  wait for your response 
qatar driving license be not valid in uae now  before it be valid  now  it not valid  but use the qatar license  a person can directely go for test in uae withotu gng for class  
it be valid if u be travel to that country  if you be go to get a rp there  you need to change it to the local one  
 if he will stay with visit visa you can use your qatari s dl but for re  visa  your friend need to have drive test only in sharjah he can get temp  dl for one monthm until you pass the driving test by the way in dubai once he get his re  visa he ca n t use any other dl  to drive in dubai  even the international dl   it mean he should det uae dl   some people make the world more special  just by be in it     
uae and qatar be both member of gcc right  i think it part of the agreement between gcc countries  so what could be the reason qatar license be not valid in uae          another thing be uae license valid in qatar  
i be in uae during april 1  14  i check this with various authority  if you go to uae on a visit visa  you can hire a rent a car with the qatar license   it be ok but if you be gong on a resident visa you can not  you have to undergo a driving class  then a test  then you get the license  to start a class  you will have to wait for day  uae want to reduce the motor on the road  so they will do whatever they can to get this achievement 
 juan  yes there be agreement between the gcc but the problem a the follow  in uae they explaintion to the agreement that only the ppl have gcc nationality can use the dl any gcc in all gcc  in qatar the explaination that anyone have dl from any gcc can drive here in the past only dubai not abu dhabi or any other allow for convert dl  from gcc but last year they cancel that   some people make the world more special  just by be in it     
among gcc state  it be understood that  anyone with a gcc driver s license can temporarily drive in any other gcc state but if the individual will have permanent residence then he have to secure a local dl  secure the local dl be the culprit in a lot of confusion  i have a uae  abu dhabi  dl gotten on dec  1993 and expire this dec 2008  when i move here in qatar on dec 2004  i use my uae driver s license when i be still on a business visa  after i get qatar rp  i apply for a qatar dl at the traffic department  i submit my original uae dl for inspection and then they require me to have an eye test only  after pass the eye test  i be issue a qatar dl in some gcc state  i hear this be not the case  for example  here in qatar i hear that they do not recognize saudi dl  some gcc state require dl applicant  even with applicant with gcc dl from another state  to undergo drive school  drive test to secure the local dl  
welcome to qatar i have visit visa for work  so can i drive  i have egyptian license  i have visit visa for work  so can i drive  i have egyptian license

if you be on a visiting visa and and you have an international driver license you can use it for 6 month i guess  if you get the permanent residence you can not use the int driver license anymore  
mr calculator consume major space for the same answer which be not help the person with right answer    you can not drive a car with egypitian licence here  a a visitor first 10 day you can drive but later you need to take a temporary driving licence for 3 month  you have to pay 100 riyal for every month and need to take eye test for this licence  
 i totally disagree with   sun fun sea   all the major accident be not cause by indians  may be indians invloved in this accident because of the other party  most of them be local with crazy drive  and you can see majority in qatar be indians that be why you can see more indians involve in accident  but not all their fault  and all indians be not rid bicycle in their past that be because of your lack of knowledge about india  what be the vehicle you use in your country before invent car  be logic and dont generalize people with your lack of general knowledge   
no  you can not drive  you should have a gcc license not egyptian  
whatever you do  pls dont drive like in cairo cheers 
calculator be off his calculation 
sun fun sea  i suppose you be say indian because all subcontinent people be like indians while they may be from pakistan  srilanka  bangladesh  nepal etc too  anyway it s not good to generalise and make such uncalled for statement  especially by an elder like you  
cars and drive driving with usa license  i visit doha for a week and intend to rent a car  is it legal to drive use usa driver license or do i need and international one  
the rental company ask for an international license  
get international driver license  
been in qatar for visit and i ve get usa driver license  i drive my friend car  it be night time  of kurs the police be asleep i guess he he he  ask the company where ur try to rent a car if it okey for u to drive with usa license  good luck    i miss qatar  
even if you have a international license  you need to get a temporary license from traffic department  when you be in doha  get the application for temporary license and submit it to the madinat khalifa traffic department along with copy of your us license and passport page show your identity and visa page you might need to get an noc from the sponsor  typed in arabic  if you visit here under visa from some company or sponsor  best way be to ask the rental car company to assist you to get it  
if you in vist visa you can drive  but if you want to cavnt to qatari  so you can apply easly just vist to traffic dept and ask for new one  
supposedly the us license be good for  7  day  an international license be good for  6  month  they be easily obtain from aaa for about  15  after  6  month and likely before then you would need to go for a qatar driver license  
the last answer in regard to need translation and all this paper work i call bullshit  it enoys me this advice which would take your time and be not true  all you need be your lie  from the state  if it make you feel comfotable and it easy for you to get international then do but do n t sweat it  when you come out of arrival you will see a dozen car rental  grab one of them  easy way to do it and screw buddy and there shit advice  dam it bugs me incompetence  
i recommend that you go to a aaa agency and get an international license  driving here in doha be pretty dangerous  so i recommend you take every measure to protect yourself  it be pretty easy and not costly  see you when you get here  
i believe you will be ok for seven day  i think you must also carry your passport with you when drive  
sorry for my early post  i didn t completely check the week s issue  actually my rental car company ask me to do all those formality when i come to qatar for 1st time even after i be have uae license and international one from uae during business visit of 2 month  as per bellow article it 15days after you enter  http  www gulf times com site topics article asp  cu 2  item 189106  version 1  template 36  parent 16

 dog in islam be acceptable so long a they serve a   purpose    in my own home  they provide security  there be step to take in the muslim faith so that dog be allow  concern wash dish  the person if touch  etc   my main concern be that this have be allow to be interpret a dog be   haram    and some people take this a a reason to be cruel and abusive  one  western  person i know say that this be due to   arab cruelty    his word  not mine   i in turn reply   i feel sorry for those who think lke that  and you  because some people  and not just those of the muslim faith  do not know how much security and real affection dog can give  they be always happy to see you no matter your state of mind or emotion  all they ask be sufficient food  water  to be treat without pain or hurt  and a few kind word     
the prophet  peace be on him  say  jibril come to me and say  i come to you yesterday but what stop me from enter be that there be a statue at the door  a curtain with figure on it in the house  and a dog inside the house  so order that the head of the statue be break off so that it resemble the trunk of tree  that the curtain be cut and make into two pillow to recline on  and that the dog be take out   this prohibition be limit to keep dog without need or benefit  
socialising bringing 2 small dog into qatar hi  do you guy know what be the process to bring dog here  i know i need to have a health certificate that be to be do within one week before they leave the us and arruve here  i also hear that there be some sort of paper they need to see stamp in qatar before the dog even arrive  can you please advice on that part   the paper and where to send it  many thanks

you will need to send the pet relocator a copy of your passport and the dog late vaccination record with the rabies vaccine older the one month and not more than one year old  the dog need to be old than 4months  which i be assume they be

the health certificate need to be within one week but the vaccine have to be give at least 30 day before travel  it s not recommend to breed and sell puppy here  there be far too many irresponsible people who get bore and abandon them  come down to the rescue shelter when you get here and you ll see the number of pure bred dog that be abandon because they get too big  or too energetic  or because their owner be go on vacation

but do n t know the process  it be possible  
the rp id  together with your passport  should be submit to the immigration to cancel it  however  they  your sponsor  can report you to the cid a absconding absconded to release them of any responsibility of you  when they get that clearance from the authority  they will no longer issue you an noc letter  and may even report your whereabouts to the police and have you deport  that would be the bad scenario  this happen to someone i know 2 year ago  i m not sure if the procedure change  
azilana  from your thorough answer  you seem to be an hr generalist  what happen to that someone you know 2 year ago  be that person still in qatar or deport already  
 that   someone   be deport   
human resources generalist be a person can mean different thing depend on the company  normally  and hr generalist be similar to an assistant  but for the human resources department  they may help with run background check  the hiring process and any other task associate with human resource  
that someone be deport  sound like you know him her and work with you in the same company sponsor

salary and allowances minimum wage for house maid  i have be tell that the qatari government be about to introduce a minimum wage of 1460 qr per month for house maid  the sponsor have to pay it directly into the employee s bank account  anyone with more information  
there be a meeting hold at philippine embassy last week and they tackle about this matter  one of the requirement in submit agreement in embassy be labor contract sign by the sponsor indicate the salary of  400  we be still wait for the confirmation of the additional requirement  once the labor contract will be attach to the housemaid s agreement  the indicate salary will be implement  
really too much  and in this case my advice to the concerned people to stop bringing house maid from philippine a many people can not afford 400 usd  
qar 1  460   do you really know what these maid actually earn  they be treat a slave  
if true  it s a move in the right direction  anyone who pay their maid less than that be nothing more than a slave owner  
its a step forward  if you ca n t afford a house maid  do n t hire one  better late then never  
if you ca n t afford to pay the maid  then do n t get one  
you all know how much they earn back in the philippine a a maid dont you       how much a a teacher    how much a a office girl   and they say anything less then qr 1  400 per month be slavery  wake up  so let all you lovely pinos tell me how much they get back in the philippine    a i think we do know    how much again     let start this by you all tell u here  
when i buy over a maid for slightly less monthly sum i be inform by my colleague that m pay her too much  they pay around usd 200  250  in the interest of all there should be a minimum wage however my maid send home 95  of her salary  i remit it myself to her mother account  she eat th same food a u  have her independence and be happy  her brother out here keep thank my friend for the recommendation  the point be the salary i m pay be less than the op cap and she be more than happy  it be in multiple of what she be earn back home 
 most of them be treat a slave  their agony will continue if the government will not take legal action in hire these poor housemaid    give what is due    
it s the govt responsibility for the welfare for it citizens   there have be cases of salaries not be pay for 6 month or more  i think its a small step forward  would certainly make a difference in time to come  
best place to look for work  hi  i be currently look for a security base job in qatar  as an ex british soldier  i can adapt and learn very easily and with my past experience i will be look for a reasonable salary  can anyone recommend any company that i can apply to please  any help would be really appreciate

if ur try to move to qatar then al saad be best area for resident  if ur marry and u have kid it wiil be more good because this area be quit and every thing school  hospital all around this area  
ramada  but it quite expensive  studio cost you 7000 per month fully funished 
1st it ll be feasible to bring ur furniture with a there s alot of unfurnished flat here  2nd the best place depend upon ur demand villa compound  flats compound  villa area or quiet area and offcoarse on ur budget u can have a 2 br flat here from 4500 to 17000 and villas from 9000 up to    
thank you so much for your quick response  well what i be look for be a 1 bedroom appartment  an area with cinema  beach  bar  mall would be good  however  can not deal with traffic here   
al sadd and al nasr be the best place  accessible to everything  
do n t come to qatar    
i check on google map  al sadd and al nasr seem too far from my office  my office be on the pearl  would be hard to get there every morning  any other suggestion  thanks a million  
if ur run from dubai coz there be traffic  here also the same  but it still bite good than dubai  if ur work be in the pearl u have to live some where near that place even though it a bit far but it quit and good area and no traffic there that much 
west bay  little traffic here  near city centre mall for cinema  hotel nearby with bar  and very near the pearl  downsides  lot of construction  expensive and nowhere be within walk distance  not even a little shop   
bring your stuff with you  i move from saudi to qatar  cost only a couple of thousand to ship  
opportunities i be a chinese girl  i want to work in doha i be a chinese girl now work in shanghai for an american website  www smarter com i just graduate from university major in english  work in different country be my dream  can someone give me advice what job i can do in doha  and be it hard to live in the city  be there some good website for apply a job in doha  thank you for your time   
i would advise you to pick a different place  many people will view you a nothing but a prostitute in qatar  yes doha be a tough city to live in and the cost of living will cause you to save little to nothing each month  plus they be n t go to pay you what you re worth because you be chinese  chinese be put into the lower income bracket in qatar  that be just the way it be over here  not fair  i know  if you do go  do n t let them take your passport from you because then you may find yourself work at the oasis just so you can buy back your freedom  i hope this help  sage 
thank you for your advice  it be really helpful  also  i have a different thinking about the city now  but if i have chance i still will go there  the reason why i go there be not for money  and i can have a good life in china  and i only want to work one year there  i just want to enrich my life  know more about the world  like now  i know their attitude about chinese girl  hooker  i think there must be some chinese people do it there  but not all  what others look at me be not important  the point be that i know what i be do  i know that be a rich place because of oil  but only rich material life  shanghai people be not that rich  but i really suggest they can visit here  they will know how wonderful this city be  how great the people be and how happy the life is money be not everything  it be only one tool for u to reach happiness  and i be happy now  people there can look down upon chinese people  it do n t matter  cause we be so proud of ourselves  
 among all place  
honestly  if you want to enrich your life then qatar be the bad place i can think of  honestly  qatar be the definition of an empty shell  nothing of substance here whatsoever  here you have an entire displaced foreign population  all here for work only  there be no culture here  work be the culture  as for the geography  the bad found anywhere in the world  no tree  no river  no lake  no mountain  lot of traffic though  terrible climate  etc  etc  combine that with no fun at all  unfair pay base on your nationality  and the surrender of your passport  if that be your idea of enrich your life  go for it  
do you know anyone work in qatar  
 sage i dont know how you can say those thing about qatar  i can only presume that you havent really bother to scratch the surface of the country to get past it   outer shell    you might discover it not as empty a you think   
lots of job   salaries in the same field vary a lot with nationality  qatar tax income by housing rent  50  mininum  so if you manage to get a job make sure the company house you or at least pay you the amount of your rent  even if it increase   you will need qr 1000 for food  other expense if single  anything above that you can save  depend on how much you want to save  i would say the minimum one should ask for should be qr 2000 above the rent  else you would be really waste your time and youth  although there be construction worker who work for qr700 which would be roughly what they earn in their own country   srilankans  nepalis mostly come here to get away from the civil war in their country so they be willing to work for so low   qatar be boom in 2 sector oil gas and construction  1st be nationalised so you may find it difficult to get into  the second be not a boom it a blast  theres always job in construction companies  all other service be grow   
 outer shell needs more money  this country is for rich people who have a lot of money to spend on having fun  but wut about poor people  do n t they have the right to have fun though    similar eye be see similar thing  in a different way    
this be a complicated society but it can be very enrich  try spend a weekend in the desert with a qatari family  attend a magilist  learn arabic  learn to dive  go fishing and sail with qataris  i have do all of these thing  it be not easy to make the connection  you have to make the effort but like many other thing in life  the more effort you make  the good the reward  i think you do most thing here that you can do anywhere else  i admit  i miss mountain and climb and greenery but there be plenty of good thing here and some very fine people  just go and out and find them  
 undoubtedly you can experience new thing and enrich yourself in qatar  a in any other country for that matter  but the question here be another in my opinion  we can not pretend there be not issue in this place  specially if you carry the   wrong   passport  so i think it be fair that maggie get the full picture  both the rosy and the dark side of qatar  then she can make up her mind   
qatar living lounge what be the doha library like  where i live before  i like get a few hour of work do in the library every once in a while  what be the doha library like  i hope it be not overrun with scream kid like the library in my canadian hometown  does it have wifi  
what library    mandi 
there be no library in doha  
as far a i know  central library be under construction  which be have the best facility   
hmm  can you think of a nice quiet place with wifi where i could get some work do  preferably not a coffee shop  would there be a library at a university  
i would suggest you slow down a little bit  your excitement with your relocation appear a bit excessive  keep your expectation low  everything at it time  when you be here  it take less than a week to see everything that qatar have get  do not worry bud  you wont be leave out of anything  
lol that s not how i roll  virgos be  neurotic  
you have to make sure  you dont look like a spammer  
haha  be i get that reputation  
yes 
yes my dear 
moving to qatar personal loan and work termination i be currently work here in qatar  our employer inform u that they will transfer to contractor with less salary  but we have option not to accept  but the problem be i have personal loan in one of the bank here in doha  what if i will not accept the offer  what will happen to me  i mean do the bank will force to pay or not  
haha  so you want to get away without pay the loan  
not really  but iam just curious what if the company be the cause of termination  
yes  but your loan and contract be with the bank  
you mean even the cause of termination be the company  the bank will force me to pay   and wat if i find new job with less salary war will happen do they reduce my monthly fee  
i be sure you can renegotiate the repayment with the bank  
ah okay  because i be just worry  but not pay and run from my debt be not my option  i do believe in karma  thanks for the info  
you re welcome  i hope it all work out for you  
fact  if your company terminate you  take that letter to your bank  you wo n t be require to pay any remain amount  bank will use it tact  do n t yield  after few day of delay  finally you will get clearance from bank and fly home  insurer of your money  bank would pay that amount to bank  may be insurer and bank be have office in the same building  or manager be cousin  they be after your money  so escape clear from both party  pray hard  good luck in find another job soon somewhere  regards  
would you believe if i say 1000 have leave without repay a single coin in case your company terminate you  what for you pay premium every month my friend  
this be interesting  i do not know this  to be honest  i be surprised that this be possible  but good for those who have bank loan

my start be that i go to the department of islamic affairs and get a bunch of book include the quran  i start read at 11am and do not stop until 11pm  i immediately know that this be the religion for me  eventhough i be highly sceptical when i start read   i have read so much since  learn by talk to other moslims  take some course  but my thing be read so i do that the most  i suggest you talk to some other new moslem  it will be easy a the question you have be the same question they have  when i start there be not many people i could approach  nor where there any centre a such and i talk with moslem by birth and they have a hard time understand my question  ofcourse if i can help  let me know  aisha taweela

it be not a question of easy or not  converting to islam be not just say  hey world i think i will become a moslem  no it be much much deep  it be a question of a total change in lifestyle  in my case at least  it have more to do with your innerself  how you look  approach and accept what be in your life  i can tell you it do good than go to a phychoanalist  you learn so much about your self  about the purpose of you be there  about the purpose of living  about the purpose of hardship  islam should not be hard on you  but it be how hard you make it on yourself  aisha taweela

has anybody reach to that stage in life where you do n t care if you never see tommorrow  you have already see it all  you already know all   nobody or nothing surprise you  everything be deja vu  
well you can never see it all there s always something new take for example the 4th theory of isaac newton which they ve discover lately  it state that  if you can run around an apple tree  with the speed of light  you d be able to  yourself 
ah the three wise monkey be back  too intellectual for them all  next they will just say god do it a an easy cop out

science assume that the universe start with a singularity  where there be nothing nothing at all  then logically  the universe be suppose to come back to it original state at some point of time who know  i have try but could never understand quantum fluctuations  which be say to be the reason for the big bang out of a singularity  further  the anti matter  and negetive energy  be still theoretical concept  if the same be proven someday  it would far help u to understand if the universe will die at all  but  at present  it be a general opinion that universe will keep on expand and may freeze out when all star would become either black hole  neutron star or white dwarf

politics is sikhism the answer  allegedly from dr john smith of the athiest society  http  www qatarliving com files image001 jpg 
 like some other religion  the concept and the ideology of sikhism be commendable  but some of the follower get off track  just type   sikh terrorist   into your favorite search engine for example  it be shock   
asking this question in a muslim country  hmmm  
 img nid 103941 title desc link none align left width height 0  
for some moron  yes  sikhism be the absolute answer  these moron be such people who try to find meaning of life by criticize principle of heavenly religion  their station  my friend  be hellfire  this article have just reassure me that heaven be not easy and hell be not pointless  
 is this a game of jeapody    deaths in the bible  god  2  270  365 not include the victim of noah s flood  sodom and gomorrah  or the many plague  famine  fiery serpent  etc because no specific number be give  satan  10     
at one point in their history sikhs be either hindus or muslim there religious teacher declare himself a a prophet of sort and now an interesting fact adi granth take most of it principle from the quran  so it no biggy that it mention the big bang and the round earth  though in the quran the shape be of a sphere which be more correct  etc  the book be compile by study the faith of islam with two of his muslim friends namely sheikh farid  and kabir  he never claim divinity though but instal the principle of one god  same a islam  and the priesthood  not important in islam atall   
shuaibkazi  do you know why sikhs men do n t cut their hair and sport long hair like woman  
thats a very strange topic to bring up here    i wonder  why       never ask for a smile just give it  
 i think it apply to   all   hair  so  if you re in a hot country      
yeah it s the answer  it make complete sense to never ever cut your hair and wear a big bag on your head to keep it in  i m sure whichever supernatural god fairy that create the world and the universe be go to absolutely demand that we all have really long hair or they ll be no afterlife for u  please stop be so blind all of you  there be no god  you re go to die  live your one life to the full  enjoy bacon  get piss and cut your hair 
politics un move to protect gay  transgender in a late move  the united nations continue it march to further add homosexuality and transgender to it list of human right  is the un go too far  and what do this mean for country that condemn these thing a unacceptable to their culture  will the un of the future start put such nation on it pariah list  http  www chicagonow com trans girl cross 2012 11 united nations protect transgender  
i wish the un would show the same concern for all the child be murder in gaza  
mn  but a for now un s main concern and priority be to protect gayz  transgenders    
 france be allow   mosque for gay    so it s only a matter of time before it use it security council seat to push for this elsewhere  it s a brave new world  http  www albawaba com editorchoice france mosque gay 452009  
good on the un  nobody deserve to be persecute  
would openly list country where homosexuality be outlaw to be a vagabond nation  the matter of homosexuality be by far a much dispute affair among people of various religion  creed and race  that to simply state it s right and all those who condemn it for any reason be wrong  will not be as simple  that say if they wish to protect those who be gay and transgenders from oppression and mistreatment then i suppose they have all the liberty to do so  however yes they should also then open their eye to all the oppression commit around the world at large  and work towards stamp them out  and not just pick and choose to their convenience which have clearly be the case with un in the recent time  which have cause people around the globe to hold them in contempt for  and not take them seriously  
yes  the un for push for equality and freedom  should it put non compliant nation on a pariah list  no  
 does the un have a pariah list that they add country s who commit human right violation to  or will they just add   persecution of homosexual and transgenders   to their report on various country   
marco but what about the gay and transgenered arab in gaza  who will speak for them  
of course they must have the same right a all other people  after all  they be human and they be people  what difference do their sexuality make  they be still human  
i agree fatimah  but if the un say homosexuality be a human right  then they ll list country that persecute gay right along those that deny press freedom and get involve with human trafficking  etc  qdclover  there be no gay in gaza  
politics hijab  a burden to muslim woman  why only a few muslim woman wear hijab  why not others  is hijab make a woman outdated   plz share your comments

allah say in the holy quran chapter 33 surah ahzaab verse 59  o prophet  enjoin your wife and daughter  and the believing woman  that they should cast their outer garment over their person  it be expect that they will thus be recognize  and not molest  allah be oft forgiving  most merciful  allah say in the holy quran chapter 24 surah nur verse 31   o prophet  enjoin the believe woman to restrain their gaze and guard their modesty  and not to display their adornment except that which be display of itself  and to draw their veil over their bosom  and not to display their adornment except before their husband  their father  and also forbid them to stamp their foot on the ground l their hidden ornament should be display  allah say in the holy quran chapter 4 surah nisaa verse 103  indeed the salaat   prayer  be a prescribed  and obligagtory  duty that should be perform by the believer at  their  appoint time  in light of the above absolutely c   
it s their choice if they want it or not  
politics why be polygamy bigamy a crime in the west  why be polygamy bigamy be consider a crime in the west  crime in what sense  what if the wife agree  and be cheat on wife having a permanent girlfriend besides her consider an equally serious crime  and why  why be polygamy bigamy prohibit  while prostitution and same sex marriage be be legalize  it be say that even in islamic country  bigamy be limit  so why be the west so scared about it  
economic issue  tax and benefit   but do n t know for sure  i think if everyone agree and they can support themselves  they should n t be penalize  but i do think that child be make the unwitting partner in these situation and it can be very  very hard on them  they do n t actually get to consent and the choice be make for them  i do n t think the west be scar at all about polygamy  they simply do n t approve of it in their society  it s their right  be n t it  please note  prostitution be not legalize in the us  except in one strange county in nevada that i have never understand  nor be same sex marriage  except in a very few case  i refuse to drink the kool aid   pm

follows some rule from the bible and we be allow under christian catholic church to marry only one woman man  pretty same a the islamic rule i think  the venezuelan sensation    
good question the  interesting to see a common question address to people in this region turn on it s head and ask the other way round  ca n t say i have an answer though  will be interested to read other s response though  
it s not only in the west but also on some country in the east that polygamy  bigamy be outlaw  the reason be simple  it be illegal in the new testament  bible   i m not sure what s the reason for buddhist country like thailand  singapore to adopt monogamy though  for muslim country like malaysia and indonesia  it be common for muslim there to marry only one  cultural convention  maybe  in my country  adultery  concubinage be a serious crime  but it be a crime that be so hard to find evidence of    usapa na  
polygamy be not a crime  you just can not be marry to multiple individual which have become a standard that derive from judaism christian value  as time progress and the consequence form multiple partner slowly reveal itself  std s hiv and such  we can conclude that this have be the right approach  unfortunately the popularity of couples  club  where couple seek another couple for sexual purpose be become more and more popular  prostitution in some country be legal  some not  as go for me government should legalize prostitution and register all that practice  create labor union and tax them over their income  why  this cut the throat of crime  repress human trafficking and serve a purpose in society  the same go for soft drugs

advice and help experience necessary for nha license   hello guys i want to take nha licensure  nurse  here in qatar but i dont have any work experience in the philippines i m currently work here now a a nurse in a construction company for almost 1yr will nha allow me to take licensure here even if i do n t have the necessary experience require  help please thanks a lot and godbless  
you must have two year of work experience to apply for the license  you can work for another year and carry on with it  since you be on company sponsorship i think you can work for another year and then apply  hope this help 
of course this help me so you mean for the meantime i can not apply for the licensure exam at nha since i dont have enough work experience  and i can add another year then use it a my work experience to apply nha exam  thanks again for notice this  
my pleasure 
you might have a problem get an nha license because of lack of experience  your employer might even be in trouble for employ you even though you do n t have a license to work a nurse here in qatar  
another advise  do n t take the ils exam unless you already have a nurse license from nha because it be useless  it can not help you get a license even though you ve pass it and your money will just be waste  
you should n t be work anywhere in qatar without an nha license  so continue in your current job for another year  then show that to nha a work experience may not be the best idea because a of now you be work illegally   you need to have minimum 2 year work experience outside qatar before come here  if you could be employ legally here without an nha license  what s the point of them conduct the exam     so if you want to legally work in qatar  go back to your home country  do n t matter where as long a you work legally    get two year legal work experience then come back here  get your degree  certificate  work experience review by dataflow  then apply to take the licensure exam  
that s the reason why i wan na know if i can still take nha licensure even if i still do n t have any working experience in the philippine but currently work here because when i be hire here i do n t think that time it be mandatory so i be hire when they implement that license here thanks for reply guy  much appreciated    
i think work experience be not a prerequisite for take the nha exam that be now handle by prometric  you can try to schedule the exam online  however  there s no point of take the exam without the required work experience since it be one of the requirement to get nha license  moreover  if you pass the exam  the validity be only for 2 year  otherwise you have to take it again  
thanks ecabs so u mean i can take nha exam without the necessary work experience  the validity be 2yrs so it wont be a problem as long a i pass it getting the nha license can come later  what i really want to know be if i can take the exam or not anyway it be a lot help thank u  
you can take prometric exam without experience  my exam s validity be 3 yr  there be many nurse out there be work without license  private clinic be very strict on accept new nurse applicant  your lucky to practice your profession with license here  but beware my friend  you need to be extra careful bec  that s illegal

regarding the starting salary  if it be your 1st stint to work a nurse overseas  that look to be fair with regard to the transportation allowance of qr1  000 month it seem to be reasonable only if your accomodation and the hospital be locate in the same city  i mean if you will be assign in al khor or somewhere far and your accomodation be in doha  then that might need to be adjust  hamad provide pretty decent housing or the other staff get housing allowance  i be not a nurse but i know some nurse work with hamad  hamad be a government hospital and in general they give high salary than the private clinics hospitals  can you provide me hamad s agency and contact address in the philippines a it could also be an option for my nurse daughter in the future  she just pass the nursing board exam and barely start her 1st job this month

visas and permits medical examination info  hi all  i finish my medical exam here in doha  i would like to know besides hiv and tb  be there any other disease check in the medical examination  im only interest in the disease that will make me fail the exam  and how many day or week will the result will be available  thanks 
sif you work in the admin job then u only need to check hiv and ptb result after 3 working day  if you work a a medical  paramedical or any food handler job  you also need to check hepab and hepac   
im an i t  guy so guess i dont have to worry about hepa  what about other std disease  do they check those  
but try to be clear from all these before come here  welcome to qatar  
is the medical exam result always take 3 work day  beacuse my colleague do the fingerprinting 2 week after his medical exam and he say the medical exam result take 2 week  and the only thing for him to know if he pass the medical exam be because he do the fingerprinting process  and be there anyway to know if you pass the medical exam  
once you be do w  ur medical exam you can check w  the medical commission at least after 3 working day  just show your receipt number or passport copy at the male counter section and you ll get to know if it ready or not  for a medical employee it usually take about 2 wks to have the result do due to other test  e i  creatinine test  that have to be send to hmc for investigation  in your case  you be only require to undergo blood test  hiv   chest x ray  ptb   so i think it wont take long that much  dont you have mandoop representative for your company  he be suppose to follow up all these thing and you can always check w  him  good luck  
thanks apple for always reply on my post  another thing  after medical will i immediately go for fingerprinting or it will be for another week or so  
yes  you can do the fingerprint immediately  so  just relax everything will be ok

indian guy versus pakistani guy more handsome and attractive  who  pakistani guy or indian guy   
qatari culture can qatari girls allow marry indian     why arab girls not get marry indian man 
if the indian man be hindu  no  it s not allow  mandi 
so qatari female qler answer you that why they dont marry you  
give u some really knockout reason why we should  we re very picky so you ll have to be very persuasive                     
im go to be honest and blunt  i think it because most qatari woman dont find indian men very attractive  im just tell you what i think  im a qatari man and to be honest i dont care where your from it depend if i like you enough  
lol whitefeather  do n t go upset him now                      
                   
i mean no harm  p just type my thought  
 qatari lady  be never be allow to marry any foriegner even to any arab  so why wonder  qatari ladies be bear to marry gulf men only  but i know one  the father of the lady be half indian  and the father  arrange a marriage to her for an indian groom but i be not sure if the indian be allow by the government to stay here or even live here  the lady be qatari  her grandmother be an indian  but many qatari men be marry to an indian lady  i know alot    there s nothing we can do to change the past  if it teach you a lesson profit from it then  forget it     
if that the case  i wonder why the indian movie cinema hall be fill with qatari women  even men  if there be no liking for indian men or shall i say indian actors why be that most of the qatari women see first day first show of indian movies  the curiosity kill me  
be a god fear down to earth person  not be proud just wana share that i have be close to a few  its just that i be not a qatari or a muslim which they only find out after i tell them  or else i would have be marry to one by now  1 thing to appreciate qatari woman know how to respect their men  all other woman too know it  but see a lot in women here compare to their guy  
qatar living lounge  to be with a non filipino a sin  hi to all  im marry to a non filipino man and it piss me off everytime we go out like shopping and people will gv u this nasty look a if it be a big deal for them if a filipina be with a guy of other nationality  mostly who do this be indians   sometimes also some kabayans would say   nakabingwit si kabayan ng malaking isda    it always happen to me in souq  i mean why  is loving him a sin   
you re post in the wrong section  
wen i use to walk with my philippina gf even in thailand all the indian be look in a bad and impolite way  they r like that  just ignore them  i think no hope with them  sorry but this be the truth  
 deleted by mod  english only on the main forum   
sure this will go a long long way again   
just ignore  they do n t know any better  
this be normal specially here  just ignore em  live ur life  
make sure that the problem be not u and ur asawa  the problem be the indian  so  no need to worry  
 but sometimes it so depress  my husband ask me   where in the world we can go so we dont see this i t people     
iren who care whom be you marry to and whom be you sleep with  as if indians have nothing well to do  get a life and be carefull when you abuse people by religion  race and nationality on a public forum  warm  heart which indian do screw your 455 you loose  you have be cry allover against them   watch n have fun http  www youtube com watch  v qt42ubyy0vm 
i know the feeling  some of them be just envious  and some be just plain narrow minded  because they think they re just after the husband s money  which may be true but only in some case mind you  there be nothing more that can be do about these people who have such mentality  just forgive them  they do n t know what they re doing  
socialising why keralites    why do keralites 1  when their ask their nationality  they say from kerala  be they ashamed to call themselves an indian  or they do n t deserve to be indian  2  ask to many personal question when they frist meet ppl  3  exaggerate thing  and so on and on and on    am not try to generalize but this question be for the 98  of the keralites  the 2  be my good friend   
may be they be proud of their state  aana free  jaana free  pakde gaye tho khana free  
their state be not their nationality as far a i know they hold indian passport  donot do unto others what u do n t want them do unto u

socialising qatari men and western women ok guy i be go to prehaps tick someone off again but i have a question  not sunny but me  will a qatari man go out with a western christian girl  have sex with her and then move on because he think woman from the west be wild and sex crave  sunny have receive quite a bit response from qatari men who want to date her once we arrive  i even get an offer myself  but i believe it be a trap and i tell sunny be careful  any advice out there  
it be a very rare qatari man that would want anything more than what you just describe  it be a very rare man in qatar that want anything more to do with a western girl than you just describe  meeting men here be like step through a minefield  9 out of 10 of them just want sex  and they will do and say anything to get it from you  i be not bitter  i do not hate men  but i have be live in various part of asia for the last 2 and a half year  trust me when i say if you do not want to get burn be very careful who you date  asian opinion of western woman be not very high when it come to sex and dating  tell sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first  
if you be not look for a long time relationship  go for it  when it come to a question of sex  nationality  religion do not matter  that be my humble opinion  angelo 
i must tell you redcajun504 arab youth can go to any extent to get sex  but so be men from any country  men have always sex on mind  it be always advisable to be cautious  but why be you worry  there be a huge expat population here  which include indians  europeans  americans and even australians  so  it s not a problem basically  ask sunny to be prudent and approach the thing casually  without any pre conceived notion  though caution be utmost require  you never know you may actually get a gem of person among these arabians  after all  many of them have marry westerners  but dohagirl a such be correct that youth here always look for sex  on my own experience i must tell you they see russians  lebanese and filipinos a someone always available for sex  actually  this part of the world have many prostitute from these community  throng star hotel  use your common sense and thing will be cozy for you  i wish you and your sister best of luck  ambrish  ambarishjha  gmai   
life be not easy if you be a western woman  and the main reason a man from this part of the world would want a western woman be mainly for sex  however  please do not for one moment think that the men and woman here co n t have premarital relationship  they do it just not talk about and it be not caried out in the open  due to the conservative background of the boy they will always return to their family and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the family would not be happy about it  i think it be much good to be very cautious out here although there be a great many handsome men and they can be very charm go through the arab and asian world of men they be all interested in sex  one of the thing be that be find to be together whoc ae not marry can get into very deep trouble here  just a little food for thought  
sadly this have be the case for many year  maybe it originally stem from the day when arab have load of money  visit capital city  mainly in the west  and be naturally surround  a they be rich  by hooker  word spread when they return that they have be with western woman  the assumption would then be make that all western woman be loose  that be the assumption that we come to many year ago  rather like the western men go to thailand 
thanks dweller you have be fair  dg your point be sensible i tried to see if the shoe fit on the other foot and it same ironical    lol   it be a very rare western man that would want anything more than what you just describe  it be a very rare man in the west that want anything more to do with a asian girl than you just describe  its impossible to believe that the thousand of cripple shake 70 year old western men move with 21 year old asian beauty do so  because the guy be so romantic  love and responsible that the girl fell head over heals in love with him  i have see western men in various part of asia for the last 2 and a half year  trust me when i say if you do not want to get burn be very careful who you date  western opinion of asian woman be not very high when it come to sex and dating  here i actually mean woman from china  phillipines and thailand easy prey for western men in other country south asia and middle east woman be not availabl

racism  nationalism  patriotism  all the good virtue of a citizen a la flor create that mess  
kerala be part of uk   dont miss interpret  it not united kingdom   it united kerala        
true  very true  they be same a philipino s  similar attitude  nature and behaviour  1  always talk in their own language 2  very talkative  there seem to be no end to their talk  3  ignore others 4  at work they will try to undermine people from other state of india  in case of keralites  or from other country  in case of philipino s  by carry tale about them to the bos  5  will not share information at the work place even if the other colleague desperately need it to complete their work  
keralites be mostly see ppl in gcc from india if u ask a keralite where be he frm  he will answer uk  united kerala  lol  and u r ryt there be ego clash between south indians  kerala  tamil  karnataka  and between north indians which i dnt wish to write in this public forum  sorry  
who care

why u discus about indian especially kerala people u have lot of problem in ur nation india be not like ur country come and check the variety of culture and custom  jelousy be not good  do your work  
qatar living lounge western men and asian women  i ve notice recently around qatar that the rate of western men with asian woman be pretty high compare to other place i ve live in  i m just wonder what s up with that  do western men over here  and everywhere else  have a preference towards asian woman or be just a coincidence that i see alot of these couple around  anyone have any idea  
hehe  truth be  asian woman be pretty  though not fairer   secondly  asian woman be try to escape to the west  life be easy for them there  
and people accuse me of open a can of worm yesterday  this be just go to turn into a thread bashing western woman  it s already start with labyrinth s comment that asian woman be pretty  let the firework begin  i feel your scorn and i accept it jon stewart 
maybe it s just a coincidence  and asian be not pretteir than western woman  asian  westerner or from east  whatever  be all beautiful in the eye of the beholder   anyway my husband be british and im from philippines  his first wife be british  he be n t really look for asian  we just find eachother and fell in love    
good topic for discussion though  we always want what we do n t have  and the very fact that the western men be use to see the same type of woman all around them  make them want something they do n t have  i e  the small petite asian woman  besides  most of the western men have be thru a marriage earlier and then have asian woman  reason being because they be more homely and like be stay home mom  rather than pursue a career in the west  as far a the asian women be concern  yeh the thought of a good  clean and quality life  attract them more towards the western men  i m talk general over here  to prove my point  try take a peep at one of the cyber cafe s in manila or cebu and you ll see all of them woman on webcam talk to a wester man hop something will click  the same be the case for asian men  most of them would love to have a western woman  but have to work their way to get to that and maybe the thought of fail  make them wan na   
why should the woman be a stay at home mom have anything to do with it  i feel your scorn and i accept it jon stewart 
coz many of the western guy i know who have asian wife say that they make excellent stay home mom  do all the domestic chore  while the boy just come back  grab a beer and watch tv  compare that to a wester woman who be career orient and want her man to share equal household responsibility                                250 ql point and move up    ray gon na get the bolt  from ol  king colt                               
good response 
boy  there s a catch   p they can keep them then  i feel your scorn and i accept it jon stewart 
who s response be you refer to                                250 ql point and move up    ray gon na get the bolt  from ol  king colt                               
it s such a fact  that in the us they have the mail order bride that be all from asia  i do n t know that for a fact  but i hear something like that  i mean it s like buy something off e bay or amazon  lol  also if you see in bangkok or phillipines  you always find western male  mostly over 40  there in search for an asian woman to marry  now it s a different story that not all of them marry                                250 ql point and move up    ray gon na get the bolt  from ol  king colt                               
qatar living lounge  worst embassy in qatar  ok  your nomination please for the   most useless embassy   in qatar  who should have their little diplomatic flag stuff up their nostril  who forget who pay their salary to swan around to cocktail party  who could n t get care less about the citizen as long a they get to have a shiny car  who think a visa be a card to go shop with  please give me reason   no more than 300 word  thank a bundle   
so i cant vote  d create your own destiny  fight against your dark side  raise your spirituality every day be a new day a new life  keep the faith   
no excuse swissy  any embassy you have have dealing with for a visa or something or even that you have hear about  
they refuse to give me a visa for entry  despite hold an indian passport    lol                      e4u  rnh events present golmaal pyaar ka  unlimited edition of laughter on 22nd november 2007                      win ticket at our website  http  www e4u name qa main htm 
india embassy at it best when it come to bureaucracy and red tape no other can take this top spot i would rather have one rise and a kind word from a friend while i m here than a whole truck load when i m go 
it s it s the egyptian embassy  just few month back  they threaten the egyptian living in doha about be legally sue and track if they talk about egypt in public forum  this be announce in qatar daily newspaper  
tcom     that must be a left over from the british rule 
why blame the british for everything  a it be we be expert at blame game i would rather have one rise and a kind word from a friend while i m here than a whole truck load when i m go 
the bad  for me  be the british embassy  i m a brtitish citizen  but my best friend s wife be try to join him for a week in the uk a he s leave for work  the embassy staff ask her to renew her passport because her country come out with a new one  she get the new passport go back they laugh at her and say  come back on sunday when she go back  they simply tell her we re not give you a visa  not fair  the poor thing really want to go see her inlaws she never meet them  sad 
 its not only the way indian embassy work  the house keep be typical indian and qatar govt  also must be well aware of the indian ness or else what can you say about the approach roads to indian embassy  when ever i get home sick   i just go around the embassy and i be in real india       they walk among u  they vote  they even reproduce       
i would not knock the embassy on a forum either  t say why blame the british for who blame them   all embassies be full of red tape and paper work  and every piece of paper cost money lol  not even death be free because it cost your life  
socialising fall in love with a different nationality  just hear from qbs radio  so now i wonder what love really be  or why do we consider nationality  job or special thing a a category   
plus the future  that be why you consider nationality  job  etc  
love be blind  love be pure  love know no boundaries  
it be an investement for some girls ladies   
love come from the most unexpected place and person  
love be blind  but marriage be an eyeopener     watch out    
 you can never find a perfect partner to love you the way you want  only a person who be willing to love you more than what you be  someone who will accept you for what you can and what you can not be  and that s even good than perfect                                  admit your mistake  before someone exaggerate the story     
 considering nationality  income etc be a smart thing to do imho  nationality difference can lead to dispute about where you will live  if it be accept to the family  if you will be able to get your spouse into your country and many more  as for financial status  love be great but it doesnt pay the bill  i for one wouldnt want to have a future with someone if we didnt have a pot to p ss in or a window to throw it out my entire life  but i guess thats just my female gold digging instinct  i love the fact that someone state that we girls ladies be the only one who see their potential partner a an investment     diplomacy be the art of say nice doggie  until you can find a rock  will rogers    
brit  i d add to your list  a real love be unreturned one  if we love with the condition that he she love u in return  it be already conditional love  how many time we hear  oh  he be bas rd  he do n t give you what you deserve  leave him  it be initially wrong  if you be with the person just for receiving what you deserve   it be not love  it be a contract  love be giving without expect anything in return  the peak top of pure love be when you keep love the person even know you will never get anything in return  and even know you will never be together  this be a real love with no doubts   you become responsible forever for what you have tamed   antoine de saint exup ry 
love be something we dont have now adays  my answer to amoud that somehow you be right but thousand of year ago our ancestor do n t even bother about financial status  they can go to the wood and hunt or cut tree to build shelters find food and they enjoy life everyday  but since people become greedy  lazy  they have develop a system or hierarchy that devide us  love be not about future  it be the devine force that inspire u to do good thing for the one we love  
it be always the lost that need my guidance

who be sell silica he can guide to the wholesaler   img nid 53652 title desc link none align center width height 0  
wow   what for  is that the same a semtex  
what for u want to use this  it use a moisture absorbent  and they use only in chemical industry  u can ask the chemical supplier  to the industires like nalco etc   but y u want common life    
 i think no one will sale a large amount for that  if you really need it  you should have take a permit first from ministry of health or elsewhere  silica be if i be correct be derive from the element or a substance like acid or solvent and in that case  any large amount be questionable by authority  because  some might be use for make something destructive  if you know what i mean  or something use by sniffer    i be not really sure of what i say  but  one thing be sure  if you need it in big quantity  you should have take a permission from authority    there s nothing we can do to change the past  if it teach you a lesson profit from it then  forget it     
well  few week ago we purchase silica gel to be use in one of our project in mesaieed area and there s only one in qatar who offer a low price a we canvas already for more than five supplier from local and other country like ksa and china  here in qatar  the only one which offer the low price be al muftah  if you need their contact detail  i can give you  just let me know hope this can help you

tell me the name of that engineer  maybe he be not a filipno  curry be mostly use by nepalese and indians  and never heard of dog meat curry  and it a pity that they will dognap to eat it  that s rubbish a they say  
maybe that engineer be an asian  filipino do n t eat dog meat maybe on other asian country that their specialty during their wedding ceremony  
eeooowwww    we dont eat that       
the word curry  alone be not popular in philippine  let alone dog meat curry  i hear that word first from my indian friend who share to me that some community in his country serve it in special occassions  
i do n t know if filipinos eat dog meat but i hear that the vietnamese and koreans do  infact it be say to be an expensive dish  so if you have pet dog just becareful  they may end up in someone s pot  
this question be a just a diversive way of say that filipinos do eat dog meat  come on  look around and be good to people  ask a question that you know the answer be 5tup1d1ty  filipinos be sweet people  
 vma  in nagaland  india   they fee the dog some spicy food and then force it to wash it down with some strong alcoholic liquer  then they take the dog by the tail and give it a vigorous swing and shake it until it become sick and throw up  they collect the vomit and leave the dog alone and the vomit be use a a topping for a very special rice dish during ceremonial feast  and btw  they eat dog  crow  rat etc in some part of the north east too  so   dog meat curry   and   dog puke   be an indian dish  i have hear that other asians like a some koreans  not all  and some japanese eat   dog meat   too  exotic food be popular in many asian country  but filipinos do it   field rat   and   snake meat    if i be not wrong   
whoever say that filipinos eat dog meat curry be wrong and serve in wed ceremony  come on get your fact right  
 i be indian  and agree with carlester  it be a indirect question   does philipinos eat dot meat    there be lot of story go around the way filipinos eat  can someone put some light  which be the meat popular in philipines   apart from chicken  mutton  beef  pork  it may clear lot of doubt  include mine    
i think you be get confuse with pig  pig be serve on philipino wedding  dogs be not eat by filipinos as far a i know  curry be an indian dish not a flilipino dish

i be an uk national and have a great position and great pay  thus i do n t believe that will be a problem  i can sponsor my husband that be not a problem  would he be able to work at his current firm under my sponsorship  or apply for a new job  if he get a new job  he can transfer from my sponsorship to his new comp  i know people who come on wife s sponsorship and look for a job and transfer thier sponsorship to thier new employer once they get a job  but that person do not have a job or previous sponsorship  our case be different  cause he have a current sponsorship  only reason why we want to switch be so that he can have some freedom to choose  this whole release thing be like torture

coelacanth  in the case that i have noc  would there be no problem on the part of the immigration a to the transfer  be there no prohibitory period a to the tansfer  thanks  
only transfer from one company to another require minimum of 1 year stay from the previous company  a per the labour law  husband sponsorship  i doubt there be minimum requirement  you just need to apply for a labour card in case you want to work  
if that be the case  then  i can ask my husband for the change sponsorship  i be sorry but i get one more question  beofre  i be not able to transfer from visit to husband sponsor because his salary be only half of what the standard requirement of qrs 10  000 for resident under family sponsorship  my kid who be under visit finally receive their rp when i get an rp from my employer  the last question now be  with the same salary my husband have  plus my work visa which i intend to transfer to husband  what be the possibility of the husband transfer  thank you so much for your kind attention and detailed answer  really appreciate your good soul  godbless

you wo n t get an approval if your husband s salary be below 10  000  the reason behind it be you can not live comfortably if your whole family be with you  and the head of the family earn only 5  000  way back 2007  the limit be minimum 7  000  2010 onwards  they raise it to 10  000 due to high cost of living  you can not add wife s salary to make the 10  000  
you be very lucky kabayan to be consider your joint salary to sponsor your kid here  this be the first time i hear such case be approve  good luck on your plan to transfer under husband sponsorship

minimum of qr7k to be able for you to be under husband sponsor  the sad truth be most company s preferred husband sponsor  look for another company  lucky for you that you have noc  goodluck marie  your only limitation be your soul  
u need to fill the transfer form and need salary certificate from ur husband company  if he can make for 7 k or more will be well  u must take ur father original id and ur original id and ur husband orignal id with u  also merriage certificate and ur and ur husband passport copy must be attach also with form  and it take maximum 1 hour in main immigration to transfer the sponsor ship from father to husband  one important thing once u fill the form u need to verify signature from any police officer of immigration and he will stamp the paper then only they will accpet ur form to transfer the sponsership  
i feel so sad find out i can not transfer to my husband s sponsorship with his qr6k salary   
they dont see bank statment  just need salary certificate from the company  he can talk to managment to give one salary certiface mention 7 k only nothing else  if they dont give letter just get for 6 k and i will try to help u to sort it out  
let them mention 6 thousand plus home allownce  and for ur info letter should be in arabic they dont accept english letter  u can go to any typest in souq waqif near bismiallah hotel they can make u one  there be one typist shop no 2 from bangladesh he have good knowledge for thse kind of letter a i make one last time from him for same to change my wife sponsor from her father to mine  
what i mean be for ur information u should get letter in arabic the salary certificate  
dont worry it not a big deal as long a u have all document noc letter from ur old sponsor  proff that u r his wife  not a problem to change sponsorship  
let me ask my husband if he can get that salary certificate from his company  is it okay if we can mention that the company be provide for his accommodation  also  what do you mean by info letter  is it different from the salary certificate  we will try to see that typist you mention tomorrow  you know you give me hope again  i ve be have sleepless night  me and my husband be support our family back home and i can not afford to be jobless for a long time  thanks  princeofdoha

visas and permits why no family visa for female nurses of hmc  can a hamad medical corporation female nurse get family visa for her husband in qatar  if she get more than 10000 qr                 or females be not allow to sponsor their husband under family visa in qatar  is that govt  s policy and such kind of rules be there  
no such rule by the government may be hgh policy well to check with hr

i think some company do n t allow it because if their husband come then the wife might get pregnant and expect time off to raise the child

buying a car hi  i m plan to buy a car  which be well honda civic or hyundai santa fe  both 2011 model  just new here in qatar  could you pls give some feedback reviews  
moving to qatar things to check before buy use car hello friends  i be plan to buy a used car  i do not have experience a what to check before buy a car  can you please advise what thing i be suppose to check before buy the car and how to make sure the engine condition  thank you very much for your advise  
this be discuss a couple of month back  just run a search and you may get all the info  the most important one would be the car condition which you may get do at some inspection shop  the search would get you the detail of such shop too   all the best  
german or any other computer test garages 
engine  gear  any dent on the car body etc etc 
check for leak  tire  test drive it  check if there be unusual sound or noise or vibration  but since you re not familiar with this  i would suggest you to bring a mechanic with you when check a used car  
also traffic fine  
traffic dept  will automatically check the violations fines during the transfer of ownership registration  
dont buy used cars dont buy from the new person whom you seeing 1st time try to buy from your friends who plan to change model check wel traffic voilation of this car number insurance go trial with a expect mechanic if he is your good freind in garage they can stop all the unwanted noises temporarly just from 1 trial drive you cant find any problem from the car better buy a new car 
 your first recommendation be to not to buy used car     garage can stop unwanted noise     hehehehe  do n t buy from a unknown person      carwanted  suggest you take a friend along who know his car  online they recommend to check the muffler  you need to know what that be  btw it be not a type of scarf or something you wear around your ear when it be cold  my car have the battery in the boot  not footwear  and   dicky   be not a term widely use  if you do n t know this  you d say that my car do not even have a battery      
 and do n t ever ask a guy to check his   dicky   out  or open his   dicky    you ll be arrest  for others  we indians use the word   dicky   for the trunk boot of the car   
lots of thing to check in buy used car  well bring a trusted mechanic with you  under carriage noise be easy to resolve than unusual engine noise so becareful  if you want to check combustion efficiency of a car  check the tail pipe  it must have no oil  and in the morning when you start up the engine for the 1st time  if water condense out of the tailpipe they say this be a good sign a to engine combustion  i m sure there be lot of other thing you should check  so research a well

i agree with giasi  i own a nissan in dubai and it be a pleasure to own it  however the dealership and service of nissan in qatar be horrible  they dont service the car at all just do oil and filter change all the time  ask them for service and they will talk of a schedule of leaving the car there for few days  usually 3 days   if you have the misfortune of a dent on your car it will take a week for them to repair it  why sell cars if you cant service them   nissan cars are really good but the dealership at qatar be a living shame  
advice and help when be the best time to buy a car  dear fellow ql s  i be plan to buy a car but so far have be intimidate with the escalate car price in almost all dealership and agency  i be now revise my plan to wait for promotion or season where the price be discount  can anyone help me when will be the best time to buy a car  further clarification would be  would it be best to buy during ramadan  last quarter of the year  etc   thanks in advance  
the best time to buy be        when u hv lot of money in ur pocket   
usually start from september october the dealership receive new model of the next year  and they reduce the price for the model of the current year  in case the car be still in stock  selection be narrow by availability of certain model  color  etc  but sometimes you can get quite a good deal  
during ramadan be the best offer 
generally between july and august there will be good offer in many dealership showroom 
when holiday in expat school start  
the best time to buy a car be when you feel that you should have car and dont forget to have good money in your pocket  
thank you all for your response  to vicky111 and surabiabi  it true that the best time to buy a car be when you have lot of money  though if that be the case  then that will be the time i will be go for final exit to my country  despite my need to have a car on day one  anyway  thanks again  
i agree with qatarisun  
if u be not very much into a virgin  car look out for bmw s or merc s or chevrolet s after some high profile event have conclude  they run the car for dignitary in those day for a few kilometer and sell them at huge discount  
the best time be when you actually need it  
advice and help buying car  camry 2009 or corolla 2012  hi everybody  i be plan to buy car  a my knowledge only toyota be the best with good a c  cheap maintenance  my budget be arrount 45k and what i find in market be either  camry 2009 or corolla 2012 so what do you think  thank you 
camry well  safe and heavey car  
even if it s model be early than corrola by 3 year  
both be good vehicle  camry have the upper hand  if you go for a new one and maintain it well  the car should not give you problem for a couple of year  
you ca n t go wrong with either car  however  the camry be big  you will get good resale for any toyota  and an old camry be nothing to worry about  a 2009 camry be pretty much just start it s life 4 year be nothing for a toyota engine and there be camrys with 800000kms still run around happily with no problems you ll probably die long before your camry do haha 
just make sure that whatever car you decide to buy  have a full service record and stay away from car with unknown histories a car be only as good a it maintenance and even a camry corolla have to depend on it owner to take care of it  you can take it for an evaluation to the bosch service center where for 500 qr  they will give you a bumper to bumper report on the condition of the car you ll need to leave it with them for half a day though i suggest it money and time well spend to ensure you get a good reliable car  best of luck 
the problem with the old car be insurance  you wo n t be able to get full coverage in case of  in the reality of  an accident  
good point mandi yup definitely to be consider  although even comprehensive insurance be a joke in qatar  
good morning  i be also think to try to get car from toyota use car showroom  what do you think  
aj  buying fro them will cost you about 5 k extra  but that will have some kind of warranty  so  if you wish to spend 5 k extra  then head for aa abdul ghani building    or with help of a friend use ql classified and select yourself but in this case you need free time to check  inspect the car condition and negotiate rate with half dozen seller before you will find the best one   happy shopping   fri  07 02 2014  10 05 hr 
if you be go for comprehensive insurance for your vehicle  go for reputable insurance company such a axa  good insurance company do n t back out when you be in trouble  
cars and drive buying a porsche  need advice hi i m in the process of buy a porsche 911 carrera  can u please offer some advice on what to look for  any pitfall  servicing cost  thanks 
service for porsche in qatar be really crappy  be prepare for poorly train mechanic be unable to repair your car and you spend load of money on repairs   
yes  watch out for the car eating pothole  and the people who wo n t notice you be beside them on the road  those two reason be why i leave my sport car back in texas

which year model be you look at  use google  porsche rms failure and find out more  good service history be important  these car can cover lot of mile if they be properly service  
i ve see several cayennes but only a couple of 911s over here  i be expect to see more sport car in doha but i guess the style of drive lends itself more to suvs  
finn i m look at a 2006 porsche 911 carrera s  its do 43k  
ok  rms shouldnt be an issue then  you might want to check out some porsche forum to find out more detail to check  im look for a porsche myself so i stumble to the rms issue  good luck for your search  can i ask what kind of money be the buyer ask  pm me if not public   
perhaps toyota would be a good choice  a lovely  nice white toyota camry  much good resale value than a porsche     
finn the guy be ask for 260k  but i m hop to bring him down a bit  what do you thing be a good price  i m not sure about price here  
be well to get a cayenne than a carera  u ll thank me later for this advice esp after see the condition of the road

qatar living lounge buying a car outside of qatar i m look to by a new car  but the local gm dealer be useless and look at me like i d ask for a turbocharged donkey when i say i want a manual gearbox  so  i ve see the car i want in dubai  is it possible for me to get a loan here  buy the car from dubai  import and then register it here  or will the bank not allow it a the car be n t in country  thanks 
take a personal loan for the amount need for the car  you can then have the money pay to your account and you can do with it what you like    
xena  now that s what i want clarification on  i know i ca n t take a car loan a it would be secure against the car  which be difficult when i have to go out of country for it  sooooooo  it be possible to take a personal loan and get the car  might have to investigate this a bit further   saeedkan  you ll have to show me this trick of eat the wrong way  i think there be only one way   
lol i love the way you describe how they look at you when you ask for the car  it get to a point that when i take my bmw for any type of repair or service  i take them a clear set of instruction to follow  i be serious lol 
at one stage i want to by a second hand car and the bank suggest that due to the interest rate be so high for second hand  about 12   why not take a personal loan at 8 9  and pay for the car that way    so yes  it can be do  
rye to be honest  i would do something similar  but my parent live in dubai  so i ll just book it in for a service over there and go visit for the weekend  drive down will be fun too  xena  thanks for the info  all good to know  
ouch  i do n t know what you re idea of fun be  well  yes i do since i peek at your profile   but get the necessary permit and go through two international border be not my idea of a fun weekend  mandi 
the drive down be not fun  o  
hi alan  you might wan na re look at the difference in intrest rate between a car loan approx 3 4  a compare to approx 9  for a personal loan  if you check with manager  not sale guy  of gmc they can get the car down from dxb for you  i hear the drive down be no fun either and not too safe too  just curious why would you like to drive a manual car when you can go in for a triptronic instead  with the increase in traffic an auto be de way to go  just my oponion  
mandilulur  ignore the profile  it nonsense  i refuse to post anything remotely truthful about myself on a public forum  my name be n t alan either  but it ll do for this forum   b2d  driving be always fun  i love car  always have  plus it an adventure  never do it before   cy  i know about the rate  but the actual monthly payment cost be n t too different  yes i pay more overall  but i can accept that for the convenience it give me in choose the car i want  i m a brit  i grow up driving manual and it a more compelling experience than have an automatic decide when to change gear  i buy the car  i ll decide when to change  personal opinion on triptronics be they be there for show  and they still be n t as good a a manual box  the wannabe schumacher s of this world can have them  i ll stick with a standard 6 speed box thanks  easier to hang the arse out of a rwd v8 when you can control the gearbox  not a sodding computer    
it be rather weird when i saw your exact name on one of my twitter following   apparently you be katy perry s favourite comedian  p i have to agree with you on manual  yes  i be a chick  but i do know a bit  very small amount  about car  i also drive a manual and when i go to buy it and insist on it  the salesman be surprised that i would ask for manual over auto  besides what you have say regarding manual  they be also easy to push start should the need arise  p

qatar living lounge child die in school bus in dps today child return late from school  dps mis   the reason be a child be find dead in the school bus  from what i hear  the child doze off in the bus during her morning trip  the driver do not notice and the child be leave in the bus  they find her in the afternoon  it should have be the heat in the bus that kill her  she be just 4 year old  did anyone hear about this  
what be   dps mis   
better confirm the news before spread this or else this will become a rumor  
yes i hear about that if it true who r the responsible for that  1  all the school management should think about school timing 2 parents should give them enough time to take good sleep in this advanced system we r torture our little angel to be in race 
i think this happen a few year ago  or at least there was such a case a few year ago  
initially wen i call a teacher she deny this  but they confirm this to the newspaper  any school should set guideline  even if a child get a good sleep  it be normal for her to fall asleep in bus  buses come as early a 6 a m  
there be a similar case in abudhabi last year i think   look like this type of incident be not uncommon in this temperature  schools need to be extra cautious with strict law  
there be a similar case in some other gulf country  i think i read about this around a year back 
what        this be irresponsible from school  govt of qatar should take actoin fot bad job shame shame dps kill one child one family  
this news seem true and school have express condolence and a holiday tomorrow  really the school authority need to be more responsible especially when they charge way too much in term of special fee and all when compare to other school in doha  the facility tey lack and the amount of negligence show be too much  there be no conductor in most bus  even the one in which small kid travel  and even after complain to the school many time  there be no action  many bus be hire and be drive by irresponsible driver who dont care about anything  another issue be the school building which have be sooo long under planning and fund raising stage  what be the management of the school do happily run their own business and drain all the money from the parent without give anything back to the school the school management should be hold responsible for the extremely poor porta cabin in which they teach the junior wing and the lack of responsibility in issue r   
how can the supreme education council not see the poor condition in which this so called high profile school be run   
family life in qatar how be education at mes school qatar how be education at mes school qatar  i be plan to get my kid admission in this school  appreciate if you could comment  recommend other school at par  thanks

i dont know why useless dog be bark to maluss

 i look out the window in mes dialect be   hay luuggdhaa  pause so that the dha  effect sink in  oudd da vaandhaaww   reebeeed haaafder me peeleez  haaall togedar nhaw   hey luuggdha  pause  oudd da vaandhaaww   thats mes for you  other than that  if you want to get rid of one of your troublesome kid and not be blame for it  let him eat at the mes canteen

advice and help why be arabic compulsory in british schools  i really want to know what be this arabic fascination in almost all the british curriculum school in doha  it be not compulsory in indian school  so what be the solution for non arabics who want their child to get educate in british school  i know there be a few british school where arabic be not compulsory but get admission in them be really difficult  so what be the solution  
what school be you refer to in particular  to my knowledge  arabic be an optional subject for non arabs at british and international school  what school be this that be impose arabic on even the non arabs  
the arabs be tie to hold back the tide of cultural invasion by insist on arabic  however like the cliff of the sea it will eventually crumble and all you will have achieve be delay the inevitable  
i do n t believe all school be force this  best to search around  friend have a son in grade 6  do n t have to take  
because it be be always good to learn another language   what s so bad about that   i could n t wish anything good than my daughter to learn the language of the country she be live in     
a i say  almost  all school  not every  i m also try in other school for the next academic year  and can i take name  of the school  here   angellinaballerina  yes it be good to learn local language  but u might not be know that arabic be a very difficult language  and to expect the kid to learn something so alien to them be quite unfair  actually everything be hunky dory till last year when the school be offer basic arabic for u and the number be also not include in the exam result  but this year they convert basic arabic to advance arabic without inform the parent  so now we be in a fix  
your in an arabic country dude  this be like an arab ask why their kid have to learn english in a western country  follow thelionus s advice  go back to india and your problem be solve  
its good to get arabic subject than history subject  i dont think you come to this country just for your child education  maybe if they know arabic they will be pay more than you recieved today  
you still have n t tell u what school this be you re complain about  no british or international school i know of imposes arabic on any non arab unwilling to learn the language  
 frenchies  if i can take name here then the name of the school be the cambridge school  even park house school also have arabic compulsory  i m now try in doha british school  
it be insist by the supreme council of education to have these subject in all school at least one term per year

education which be the best pakistani school for child in qatar  which be the best pakistani school for child in qatar  thanks 
pec i try pss but     so this year i shift my daughter to pec 
i hv also ask this question to many ppl around  most of them hv tell me it bright future pak school  i plan to get my kid admit there in the 1st week of nov 08  
thank you very much for information can anyone have idea how much tiution fee compare to bright future pakistani school in pec   private  school or govt  thanks 
frankly speaking  all pakistani school suck  a none of them have any standard if we compare them to the indian school  however  out of the available one  bright future be the best  do not go for a low fee paksitnai school a pec would be the low  if you can afford  get your child in private school like cambridge etc or otherwise bright future be the best  
there be three pakistani school here in qatar  pec  pakshama and bright future and to be honest  they all suck big time  i study in pakshama from 80 to 88 but it be n t so bad that time  we have mostly indian teacher so the standard of english be pretty good  but then somewhere end of the 80 s or beginning of 90 s they remove all indian teacher and hire pakistani teacher so their standard detoriated in a few month  i shift to pec in 88 or 89 and i be shock to see pathan teacher who could not speak or write english properly  they be pathetic in grammar and pronunciation  in 1996 i get a job at bright future when they have just open  i have see their method and standard of teach very closely  they be just as bad a the other two  i would advise you to send your child to some international school if you can afford or else to one of the indian schools  there be five of them here and all be equally good  mes ideal indian school shantinekatan dmis dps by the   
my eldest son be at bright future pakistani  honestly  i be not satisfy with the school  they dont have good standard  my son be have problem with his study there  lack of attention from the teacher and lack of skill of teach also  they dont have activity to boost the interest of learn for the kid  lack of creativity  too much urdu lesson  which i dont understand how to help him with his urdu homework   if you lucky  your child will be teach by skilled teacher  my son have a very nice and good teacher when he be at kg2 at the same school   unfortunately this year for grade 1  he s stick with unskilled teacher   indian school  yes they be good  but very difficult to get space  we ve be try for a year now  no luck   other international schools  they suck our blood out  one thing good be that we can afford the fee of bfs   my husband be a pakistani but i be not  
hello  mr haroon abbasi  i donot have an idea about all class fee of pec  but one of my neighbor s son who be in 2nd year pay qr 635  tution qr 485 and transpotqr 150  and one an other boy who be in bfps and be in grade 8  he pay qr 900  so far the result be concerned pec always top  
mr  haroon  one thing i forget in my answer  i appreciate your this effort  i feel like this be the only approach that can possibly do justice to the poor parent who pay the school fee from their pocket not from their company  
thank you very much to all my friend really i appricate to all peopls for nice infromation      again thanks alots regard 
ya it true pec be on the top from all schooles a the result and as well standerd be concern i have be observerd the faculty of many school in doha i feel they have i e pec most qualified teacher they have lot of masters degree teacehrs thats why the result of pec always on the top u can see it from the old news paper they be the topest in fedral board  i recommand u u have personaly vist all the school and decide it good it be advisable u have to google the web site of these school and look i know the web address of pec i e www pecqatar com u have to look the facilites they be offer and teachers profile dont go for fee etc hope everthing ll help u good luck 
education best indian c b s e school in qatar dear ql members  which be the best indian manage c b s e school in doha  qatar in term of quality of coach   
all school be best but me be massive and ideal have also good record and your pocket be faty  dp be also fine school  
i have repleid to this several times  mes and ideal be have middle class look  but have good academic record  but the new school have posh look  swim pool  horse riding  big fee    all be attraction for new snob couple  the young professional  who come newly to doha  be have fatty salary     or education allowance give by the employers  so u should take ur own decision 
nobody have answer proper name of school atleat give ranking of school  
somehow i be not sure what make a good school  as a parent you have to decide whether you want a school which give emphasis to extra curricular activity or academic or a nice mix of two and than go ahead with your questionnaire  as far a the quality of teaching be concern  teacher be the same as india a they have a work experience from india  
mes indian school be the best 
it depend on your nationality and salary to choose the best school  if u r an indian whose salary be average then u can choose one among ideal or mes   if u r a mallu u wud choose mes  if ur salary be high then u can choose birla dmis or mis  
hi  this depend your point of view about education  mes and ideal indian school be quite old one and they be reasonably good in the academic side  if you send me a private message i will be able to give you more detail about mes  there be number of new indian school come up these day with more facilties for student but less number of students their ratio of student teacher be 25 30 1 i think you may choose one of them  dps  mis  bps and so forth  good luck 
mes be the best in education  extra curricular activities  also in sport  
my child be study at birla and be quite happy with their coaching  ofcourse  not much attention towards extra curricular activites and sport  but my daughter be happy with her teacher who seem to be professional  almost all school like bps  dps and dmis be on the same footing  excepting that dmis be char exorbitant rate for their 7 4 timing at school  
the best indian cbse school be the bhavan s public school at wakra and matar qadeem needeless to say that even though start recently it have successfully produce a set of responsible  kind and intelligent citizen aware of their role in this modern worlds if u go to their website www bhavansqatar org apart from their esteem panel and director it be run by a philanthropist a a temple for education and all round development and hence unlike com it be a org an organisation iam happy be a part n u too should be one very now

visas and permits visit visa for pakistanis kindly someone tell me  specially if there be someone from pakistan  be there any visit visa available for pakistani  i have ask many travel agent in pakistan  but they say they do not deal with qatar visit visa no visit visa available  i be almost shock because uae visa be so easy to get  why not qatar visit visa for pakistani  
you can get visit visa but you should have any blood living in qatar  otherwise  you have to apply for tourist visa through qatar airways and have to pay for hotel accomodation a well  
well  yes  it sort of depends on why you be come to visit  do n t it  if you have no relative here  it s kind of suspect  mandi 
if you just want to visit a a tourist then you can contact the hotels direct in qatar and they may be able to organise a visit visa for you  else follow the advice a above  
about visa you can apply here through hotel then u will get it or u can apply through immegration idont think u will get it from pakistan 
i guess qatar be worried that pakistani will come on visit visa and then disappear  never leave their country and never go home  
 mozaismyhero  well  where one can disappear in such a tiny state  in desert  i guess  you be underestimate qatari s cid and police  they wo n t let anyone to disappear easily  
i guess you underestamate how easy it be to go off the radar here  as long a you do n t try and get out of the country it be unlikely the police will catch you 
ok guys come to the point again  i be not dissapearing anywhere nor be come on tourist visa  i want to come on a visit to find job there in qatar  but unfortunatly  it seem there be no visit visa available  why be that  how would i come then  uae visa be so easy to get why not qatar  please guide me and show me some way to come to doha 
tourist visa for qatar be only 15 30 day i guess  i want to have some more time to find a job in doha  right now  i think there be no visit available to qatar same like uae  
the reason it s difficult be that visit visa be not issue for the purpose of come to find a job  mandi

visas and permits maximum period of a visit visa  i m currently in doha on a 3 month visit visa  anybody can please tell me  whether i can extend this futher more  maximum of how many month  
maximum 6 months brother after that you have to exit from qatar  
after 6 month you can get an extension also   
i be on tourist visa for 1 month  can i also get extension  for how many month and how much  tnx a lot  
you ca n t get an extension  may be i could be wrong  but extension be valid for family visa holder  after they have clear their medical  
no extension for tourist visa i think  
ok  tnx a lot  do you know any company hiring for office staff  
you can also extend your tourist visa but very costly a compare with extend a family visit visa  maybe what you can do be exit from qatar then  after three month  apply again for a family visit visa  if you have a relative here  
you can extend a family visit visa for a maximum six month  but in any case that you have to extend it again after your 6 month limit  you can do that  too  i think upto 1 month  more  you just have to submit application form again to immigration with your flight booking detail

sightseeing and tourist attraction no more airport visa  today i learn there be no more airport visa  but only business visa and tourist visa  so what to do to bring anyone on a visit  
go to a hotel  book a room for the visitor and ask them to do the visa paperwork  of course you will have to pay for the room  regards   
airport visa  example  tourist visa business visa  what do you mean by airport visa  airport visa have 2 category whether tourist or business visa  how come there be no more airport visa wherein there be tourist and business visa  if there be no airport visa then there should be no tourist or business visa  even if you will go to a hotel  they will give you only a tourist or a business visa pls review your question 
airport tourist visa  personal sponsorship  be stop  and airport business visa  company sponsorship  be still issue  now only choice to bring someone to qatar  other than for business purpose  be hotel visa   mdobrasz  visa on arrival be available only for certain nationality  not for all  as far a i be aware  there be no change in that  
so that mean if i have to sponsor my mother through the tourist visa i can not do it anymore  the rule be change now  since when  only business visa to be issue frm the airport  as far a my info go  tourist visa be valid for 28 day only which be non extendable i never know it could be extend for 6mnths  pls shed some light on this if anyone have an accurate info  thanks  
some people be give wrong information about tourist visa  they cant stop tourist visa a they be promote tourisum these day  you can bring your relative only by tourist visa for 14 day and can be extend for another 14 day  after 28 day you need to exit from qatar to any near airport and can come back again with another tourist visa  this be allowded only 2 exit mean 28 28 28 maximum approx  three month 54 day only not for 6 month a some one say  
go to a hotel they will do it 
 biju abraham  my dear  you be give outdated information  if you have any doubt please visit airport immigration and enquire  they have stop issue airport tourist visa  14 day  14 day  until further notice   smily  you be confuse between ai 
i just come back from airport immigration office and they inform me that tourist visa on personal sponsorship be suspend  i want to bring my mother for 10 day visit  i know that i need a letter from my work  this i can manage  do i have to go to immigration central office to apply for her visa or there be other office  what be the duration of visit visa  how long do it take to process the visa  what be the fee for the visit visa  what be work hour of immigration office  
have they start issue tourist visa at airport now  for personal sponsorship  son  daughter  brother  sister   which they suspend temporarily  can someone who have take tourist visa confirm in this regard  thanks 
yeah  now you have to apply through hotel  no other options  and your mother must stay at hotel while she be in here  she ca n t live with you  you must ready with a lot of money  man  
is it expensive   what about chevrolet aveo car in qatar market  be it expencive or not in maintanance  i mean spare part and repare  also in resale value 
moving to qatar it s expensive ok  but be it good   it s famous that accommodation be expensive in qatar  but be that reflect good standard of finishing  decoration  facility etc     or there be no relation between be expensive and the quality   
how do you feel first  
dear  i m still in dubai  i ll join in october god willing  i do n t ever think about it think it should be ok  but some post make me have dough    so  d  do i deserve ur answer now 
i think there be no relation between expensive price and the quality  my house rent be 7500 and every day i face probelm  flooring  electricity  window  door  etc  the price be not reasonable at all 
there be not much relation between the rent and the quality of the premises  here pricing be base purely on economis based on demand and supply  its your responsibility to find an appartment which justify it rent  all d best man 
in general the high the price the new and good the house apartment  however note that some new house have high rent  cause they re new and big  but be locate in crap area  for a good place in a compound or high building you need at least 15 000 qr  and many of those place already have wait list  prices however be not comparable to rental in other country  there s shortage of good accommodation which increase the rate  it s not that housing be well in doha then elsewhere  if your employer wo n t take care of it  best be to come here and take a look by yourself  good luck  
luciano from my experience the cheap place  7 8k a month  have low quality than the more expensive place  18k for a 2 bedroom   however  do not expect to see excellent quality on the expensive place either because you wo n t  
thanks guy  i ll put that into my attention  
accommodations of high rent like 15k to 25k per month will be in good quality than the cheap one  it be not necessary that the facility will be very good if you be pay a big rent  i think now a day the rent be depend on the location and not on the facility  there be some area in qatar where you have to pay 7 8k per month for a two bedroom accommodation and there be some area where you will be ask for 10 12k for two bedroom accommodation with the same facility  
finishes in qatar appartments are the worst   prices are not justified 
 sorry to use ur attendant here but it s a chance  as it always furnish be it a good furnish     please let we skip the truth it various and it depend  bla bla   the point for me be ur opinion  thanks  
doha shopping be doha expensive  i have n t move there yet and be wonder how it compare to most european city  eat out  supermarket shopping  clothes  cosmetic  etc  
the cost of living here be cheap  although when we talk about rental for apartments villas flats it be expensive  grocery item be price reasonably and be affordable and worth  eating at restaurant more than once a week be fine  restaurant that be not fine dine   clothing  there be many store here to choose your clothes from  there be many store inside the shopping mall that be more often than not that sell on sale  cosmetics  well i m a boy and so i do n t know much about these but i see most woman here wear make up always so i think the price be tolerable  obviously the price of oil and gas here be cheap  so overall  live here in doha be cheap  
doha be very cheap for rich people  
it depends on ur earn  ur life style but i think it expensive   
30  more expensive than 4 years ago  do n t be fooled  5 for a dozen eggs  makeup double than in uk  western butter 3 small  clothes from western shops 20  more  just read the labels  i buy in uk and bring it over only thing good is the petrol  6 to fill my corolla  
doha be the most expensive city in the gcc  atleast more expensive than dubai these day   house rent  car rental  grocery  and everything else  except for petrol be high  please do n t ask me for a source  this be my personal opinion  
compare to other middle east specially dubai and kuwait doha is less expensive rent is affordable according to the people s standard  
 i agree 100  with ralph  the 1st post  housing be very expensive  although it s come down very fast  i just sign a lease on a villa for 10500qr mth    2900usd   it s brand new  2 story  4 bed  3 1 2 bath  huge rear patio  cover parking  pool  clubhouse  close to villagio mall  you can get furnished 2 3 bed apts for 6500 9000qr mth    1800   all over the place nowadays  groceries be cheap for the most part  only certain  select item be really expensive  petrol be practically free here  utilities  if you have to pay them at all  be very cheap  the best place to buy clothing be on the internet or wait for a sale in the mall store  other household item and appliance be very reasonably price a well  as someone mention  it really depend on your income and usual standard of living  the general labor  ex pats will find it extremely expensive  for you and anyone look for the best car rental rate from a professional rental company  i would suggest use   strong rent a    
mr  qatar engineer seem more like the salesman at strong rent a car  anyway  qatar be one of the most expensive country to live in  agreed  this be not the case if your housing  school  etc be pay  but grocery be obv much more expensive than every country i have be to  except japan   since qatar do not have income tax  assume you be tax about 30  of your salary when you go to buy food  car  grocery etc  
i m just try to save ex pats from the pitfall i face when i land here awhile back  it be n t until i find strong that i realize i be be screw on car rental  groceries be not as expensive a kuwait or bahrain  both country i have live in recently   perhaps you just have n t live in too many other place to judge price properly    just a thought  
i have live in europe briefly  and of course my native australia  i live in abu dhabi 2 year prior to come here  in comparison to abu dhabi  much the same for grocery  cheap for accomodation  as a general rule  petrol and cigarette  and consumer durable product be much cheap here than australia  europe  groceries be much more expensive  a they be import  however  and ironically  i have be pay less for australian lamb  beef here  than when i leave australia  mick

doha shopping why be milk so expensive in qatar  why be milk so much more expensive in qatar than anywhere else  ps this thread be dedicate to lincoln pirate    
some people say because it be import  some people say the cow in qatar be too few and do n t give much milk  others say because the shop be greedy  and others say  there be no grass in qatar  however  this thread be really relevant  
i say because caw be import feed for cow not produce by qatar care taker from from subcontinat lot of effort to drink a good glass of milk  
 this be not a bashing thread lp  please stop with the hate and negativity about qatar  curb your jealousy  and just be grateful you be able to afford the milk in this cowless  grassless nation  as for the   greedy shop owner   i can only hope that be n t direct at a particular race or ethnicity   
lipsy  be any cow s milk produce in qatar for sale  i think most of it come from saudi  
no  fm  it go directly against the authority  imagine you have ten child  how can you fee them properly  and this be the richest  country in the world  what if all other country refuse to send milk  are they drink oil or what  this be an issue of immense importance  and who want to drink chinese milk with all the plastic inside  
and  yes  fm  chadeer be qatari milk  but some people say  it do n t taste good  that s what i call bashing   
chinese milk be illegal in qatar thanks to the wisdom of the qatari government  not to turn this into a religious thread  but do milk have to be halal or be any old milk ok  
the same milk that sell for qr 7 in saudi be sell for qr 12 here  obviously someone be make a tidy sum  o  
considering that the transport cost be incredibly low  low wage for worker  badly maintain truck  cheap petrol  and presumably no tax  so someone be make an absolute killing  
i bet woman have a different stand on this  
family life in qatar compass school  why so expensive  reason  why the tuition fee be so high  is there a reason  because they provide the best teacher in doha  my kid be accept there  i like their school facility more than newton  terrible      for example  but i have know idea about teach there  is it good  
i be afraid if it be about school you have no choice  either take it or leave it  i hv some friend who send their kid to compass and so far they be happy  besides  you have to remember you get what you pay for   
why so expensive  because they can  they know most people be reimburse by their employer for education   be kind than necessary  for everyone you meet be fight some kind of battle  
very true pwb78  and also demand be alot more than supply at the moment  
i hope it s worth it  
all the school be expensive  why  because the demand be high than the offer  also everyting have go up  rents  salary  food  everything  you can look at the school database on this page and see the rate all of them be charge  you can be lucky that your kid have a place  aisha taweela 
 our kid be there last year  but we have transfer them to a cheap and good school  ca n t say where a someone  will work out who i be  kids do ok  but be not at all challenge  biggest issue be the student mix and the site  it s too small now  around 200 kid i understand   so they have lunch in the classroom and take turn at play outside  quality of ed  be basic  owing to language difficulty   load of dutch and danes  it s low common denominator stuff  but if your kid be bright  even the school that be closed  will interview and test  ours be now go to one that have be full for 4 year  but we do n t have to wait a they do v well on the entrance exam  hamdulillah  and the fee  as say above    because they can     
hmc only reimburse maximum of 21  000 per child per year and maximum of 3 child  how much do other company re imburse  do they reimburse whatever the fee be  
i know some family who get 100   even nursery  oil  construction  bank  from what i have see they tend to get 100   my husband  with the olympic federation  get zero   be kind than necessary  for everyone you meet be fight some kind of battle

qatar living lounge what be the common disease in qatar      i notice that there s some common disease with a lot of ppl here in qatar  especially with expatriate  the disease be  blood pressure diabetes and cholesterol who get one or more of these disease or at least noticed that       
disease be qling its addictive and no cure no prevention  j k well on seriuos note due to lifestyle the disease you mention be really common here    if you look at what you do not have in life  you do n t have anything  if you look at what you have in life  you have everything  
the common disease to be depression  
indeed ql be an addiction  i believe blood pressure and cholestorol be a part and parcel of over work  too much heat and unhealthy food  yep  qatar will have lot of that   
 watch out for the excessive complaining bug  it seem to get everyone especially on ql user during the summer month    i do n t think so  homey do n t play dat    homey da clown  
incessant whining  boredom etc  all disease but curable   
also think that you need to be careful with career atrophy while you be here  also the loss of use of common sense and courtesy seem to be a big problem  
image 
 depression bug  complain virus  sadness and loneliness syndrome  really common   give your hand to serve  and your heart to love    
my blood pressure be always high but stable and cholesterol be a little high  o i m still young   linnet u r totally right i forget to mention that also i forget to mention insomnia 
you be to young to be worry about disease of this kind  have fun  enjoy or worry will heighten your blood pressure   
socialising do you know any backbiter in your office  barking dog never bites  but silent one  do you think it right  do you have any experience in your work environment  just share it  at least some of u can save our job  
 there be no dogs in my office    live with passion  die with style    
 a lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose  dr  choc 
i think if you be not notice  you can go long in the position otherwise you will get bite automatically  dot com  you be right  i get bite  but i do n t care  if you have talent  nothing to worry about  
no  i bite them first before they could even try  
back biting be more of a girl  thing  be this in office or elsewhere  
 if people be back bite about you  it just mean you be do good for yourself and they be jealous  so nothing to worry about    it be well to be hat for what you be than be love for what you be not     
your officemates may be friendly to you and you to them but that do not necessarily mean you re friend  it be much good if you keep your personal life private  no need for them to know where and what what you and your other friend  or gf bf  do the night before or over the weekend  2nd tip  do your job and work  you re be pay to do so  why mind your officemates  you come to qatar to work  
yep they flood here but i do n t mind them i have a life to live  
be sure to have anti rabies vaccine www live365 com stations thevault85 
1  keep yourself busy with work  do n t mind your others as long a your bos be happy with what you be do  2  less talk less mistake  never disclose any of your personal thing  the more they know about you  the more they have something to talk about  3  avoid have too much personal call and chat during office hour  they can also look after this  4  if you want to join with their chat during break time  give them a good story on what happen to your former officemate whom you slam after you know she  he be backbite you  scare them  show them you be not tnat kind and good for them to be very careful with you

visas and permits is there anyone here marry to a qatari  i be work b4 in qatar  i leave qatar last yr but be n t able to get noc from my company  my fiance be qatari but we re plan to get married outside qatar coz we do n t have the approval yet in qatar gov t  now  my problem be how be i goin to go back there with him  can he get me a family visa  thanks in advance  
dream 
why do he not move to your country  problem solve khallas  afterall you r marry him for love and not for come to qatar right  
me  no you cant unless you have approval you have to wait 1 year then he can sponsor you with his own visa  like company visa or kadama under his name so it easy for you to chance later if you get approval  
english only in the main forum  
even you get marry to any country to have to apply here  but make sure he be apply not only tell you or something you have to be wise my dear  he be marry  you will be he s second wife sorry to ask like this cuz this all count  and his family know about you  
uffff omg    hahahahah i dont know what to do to laugh or to cry   listen if u believe him that he will marry u i feel sorry for u  second thing why u leave the country and why he didnt help u to stay and solve ur problem about the noc  that mean he be not serious with u  today im not in a modd to fight so i deleted the rest of my comment  i will let her dream about marriage with a qatari ufff how can she believe him if he didnt even help her to stay in the country  a allah      
without government approval of your marriage  you wo n t get a family visa back into qatar  unfortunately  marrying you out of the country can cause major problem for your fiance  so i would suggest you wait until your marriage be approve  the only other option be that you relocate somewhere else  marry there  but your marriage will not be valid in qatar  and you will have no claim to any inheritences if god forbid  something should happen to him  does your fiance not have some wasta  that can obtain your release from your company  i be not say that will make thing any easy  since you still need to have the govt approval for marriage  but at least you can be in qatar  near him  
fil im sure she be just naiv  for sure he be married and his family will accept her   never believe me their pride be number 1  ufff i wish girl dont trust them so easily and dont beleieve them everything bhut what to do  
xena  maybe he not a true qatari only he be bear here like a lot of others that claim to be qataris  plus there be other issue will his family ever accept you the answer probably be no  
im sorry mr amyooo not all the same    they can get marry why not  im filipina marry to qatari for so many year i have approval my kid be qataries  if god will permit  no one can stop  and so many qataries be marry to filipina  sorry to tell you

salary and allowances 19000 qar offer hi guys  i have 10 year of experience  i be from the third world country  i ve get an offer from a big oil and gas operator in doha  basic  19 000 qar house allowance  11 000 qar car allowance  2100 qar adsl  400 qar insurance only for me  total 32500 qar  marry with one small child  i do not like the offer and ask to revise basic salary from 19k to 25 000 qar  what do you think  
did not mention that the position be a safety officer 
did not mention that the position be a safety officer 
it s a good salary come 
grab it before too long  especially if your child be still not go to school try to get company paid housing only  good luck 
if the offer be at least 30  more from your present salary it will me enough for your family  consider the inflation rate of your country  a yearly salary increase would also be a benefit  
ask for 13  000 housing and also a list of school they will pay for when your child become school age  or allowance of 45  000 for school if you agree to stay that long   and ensure it be a negotiable contract year so you have time to review after you have live here for a while  congratulations  
for starter  it be a good package and i believe you should take up the offer  you should negotiate on the part where the company provide insurance for the entire family  no logic in them provide insurance just for you  second  do negotiate the car allowance coz if you plan to rent a car  a good vehicle  say a honda civic would cost you qrs  2500  a 4wd would cost you much more  third  do check where your work base be go to be  is it in al khor  if yes  it be a nice location along with a community where your family will feel at home  i state al khor coz most of the lead big petroleum company be in the al khor side  all the best  cheerios 
i be not an expert but if you intend to move your family here you should enquire about education allowance as well  education in qatar be pretty expensive  good luck  
i be not an expert but if you intend to move your family here you should enquire about education allowance as well  education in qatar be pretty expensive  good luck

 lmao darude    since when qp start recruit dog damn they be get so advanced   d   you re really something   
it depend upon the position  for ex  i know for a fact that a candidate be reject becasue he couldnt spot a shade of green properly  he wasnt colour blind  there be a lot of defence for his case  but he be reject because he couldnt recognise a shade of green  here it probably matter becasue he would be work in the lab  so it really depend upon the field of activity  its qp s call  happy heart drive safe  someone be wait for you at home 
thanks han19 for your info  guess what i can do be just wish her luck only  thanks guy and have a nice weekend  
look like you be refer to a lady engineer  if her work isnt field relate  then theres a good possibility of her get through  moreover if she be really good and the department encourage her case  a lot can happen  because in such case  if the candidate be really deserve the hr may forward the case to the concerend department to reach a final decision if the dept insist on have her and that her problem wont interfere with work  then anything be possible  all in it good time  happy heart drive safe  someone be wait for you at home

doha shopping being a single guy in qatar i feel a little foolish ask this  i m move to qatar in a month for a new job  i ve never be to qatar before  recently a colleague who s work in qatar tell me that single guy be n t allow in to mall  other place on weekend   unless they re accompany by woman or a family  is this true  if true  do these restriction extend to coffee shop  supermarket  movie  other place  also if true  why on earth be there such a rule  
it s not bad a what you think  
i think by single guy they mean labourer and not literally all single men lol   
 and you may be in for a surprise  those negative informant may have their own reason but the advantage in living and work in qatar outweigh the disappointment  you ca n t get it all  people have to grow up  by the way  most often than not  story be exaggerate  you have to get the experience yourself  
no it not like this who tell you be a      in qatar first you will have fun but after some you be bore in qatar being human 
if u r bring mixed shisha with ur self  thy gon na allow u evry whr  just dont visit city centre on weekend  else ok  every whr u can go at any day  
 there be other other place  where one can go on weekend instead of malls and other place   and that include home sweet home     
dudee e  if u get mixed sheesha along with u i be here   
nothing like that  if you be a decent person  can go everywhere but there be only restriction in two mall on friday for the labourer to give more opportunity to the family  as they declare it a family day  but not everywhere in qatar  
family day start during open in the morning until 3pm only  3pm and beyond  it okay to get inside the mall espicifically the city center  
its not like that my friend  dress up nicely and dont do anything suspicious and u will be fine  
doha shopping things you ca n t buy in qatar   what sort of thing do you find difficult to buy  or ca n t buy  in qatar

qatar living lounge working for al jazeera international i ll be join al jazeera international  a dream i ve have for some time now  i need to ask anyone  employee of al jazeera or anyone work in qatar  what kind of accommodation be provide by al jazeera for single  im worry that pre determined accommodation may be unsuitable or in an unsafe neighbourhood  can anyone help me out on this  id really appreciate it  thanks 
i do n t think you have anything to worry about  we know a couple of al jazeera int l employee and they be give really great spacious furnish apartment  i think they be 3bdrm   and then those that have family accommodation be give villa in a great compound  
that s really comforting  i have recieved a verbal offer and now wait to recieve a write one  i m british educate and live most of my life in the uk and greece but i have an arab passport  does accommodation differ if you re not a western expat  
i know a nice girl from new zeeland  in al jaz int when i see her  i will ask and write back to you  
by the way congratulation on get your dream job  al jazeera be incredible  to be such an honest medium institution in the part of the world and i hope you enjoy your career here in doha  
that s really comforting  i have recieved a verbal offer and now wait to recieve a write one  i m british educate and live most of my life in the uk and greece but i have an arab passport  does accommodation differ if you re not a western expat  
i do n t think your passport would affect your accommodation  congrats on the new job  
hi che and others  i m also come to doha to work for al jazeera insha allah  apart from wait over 2 month now for my flight intinary since sign the contract    i also have the same concern about the accomodation  does anyone know if the accomodation that be give to employee be in a specific compound or area  or do they have a network of landlord on their book and choose that way  and do that mean the apartment could be anywhere in the capital  cheer and all the best 
aljazeera be an equal opportunity company so your nationality should not matter  i also get a job offer there and be still wait to finalize thing  i already visit the company and i be thrill with the place and the employee  they be extremely nice and helpful which you do n t really find in much tv station so it be a blessing  as per your concern about accomodation  from what i hear be that all employee who be marry and have child be provide with a very decent villa in a compound and single employee be provide with a 3 bdrm furnish apartment in a nice place as well  after all aljazeera have a big name and i dont think they will throw their employee  their best resource  in a place that be unfit or unsafe  good luck and i hope to see you there

 nearly get catch with import   coke light   one day   qr12   nearly pass out from shock when the lady rang it up     if you do n t like the heat  get out of the kitchen  but stop try to fan the flame before you leave  it will burn you on the a  a you go through the doorway     me visit www qaws org  
i quit buy the can of dr  pepper when they go up from 2 50 qr to 10 qr for one can  i use to enjoy the one at landmark but now they have really price me out of the shop   be kind than necessary  for everyone you meet be fight some kind of battle  
biopot yoghurt for 24qr   i ca n t believe i m admit to this   mandi 
you ca n t teach experience  
 gogi berry juice  qr 149 for 1 litre  i think it would feel good to admit this but it just make me feel bad      diplomacy be the art of say nice doggie  until you can find a rock  will rogers    
most item in mega mart should be buy with eye close at the price  just look at the label and think how it taste good  i just go there once a month  so i can stay within my monthly budget  my kid love the variety of chocolate and chip they offer  
when i first come here and mega mart be the in  place for me  i hate the place now  i buy a cabbage and it cost over 5 quid  my thought be my own  but i doubt my mum would agree with some of them  
haha  great post doubledown  i ve have a box of shreddies for around the qr50 mark  and various fruit and veg that require a re mortgage to buy  
tallg youve make me feel well  although i now wonder what i pay for my shreddies last month  penny how great do that cabbage taste and when be the last time you go  
you often find that when megamart get something new in they slap a ridiculously high price on it in the hope that people will just buy it  which we often do  clearly   but i ve quite often see that a few week later the price be drastically reduce  sometimes halve  presumably because not enough people be buy it at the ridiculous price  
working in qatar  driving license hi everyone  i be plan to move to qatar next month  can anybody tell me what be the system for a newcomer on   driving license    is it that one have to pass a rigorous drive test and then he be ussied a drving license for a fee even though he possess a driving license of his home country  rgds asd  
i think it depend on where your original driver license be from  i think people from the states  uk  south africa  canada and probably others can just convert there old license to a local qatar driving license  you just need to do an eye test  
get an international dr lic before you come  it will be good till you get your rp and a qatari lic 
is any member of this site be work with qp  how be their work culture  rgds asd  india 
hi folks  i be start work in doha in august and i be wonder if anyone know if it be possible to transfer my uae license to a qatar one  my canadian license have long since expire  but i have be on my uae license for the past 5 year  i would rather not deal with the hassle of redo my canada license this summer  but i bet it would be simple than do the qatari drive exam  anyone have any experience with this  cheers  
i be not sure about people from the uk asthey be drive on the left hand side of the road  however  there be other ex pats here who be drive they will probably know about it  i convert mine from the uae a i ca n t find my european license and that go no bother at all  
first of all you have to get your residence permit  afterwhich you can apply for a qatar drive license  if you already have a driving license from your country  take note that most of the western country they will just convert it  no need for you to take up the test or go to a driving school  if your license be from asia  it depend  but most of the asian license you have to undergo a driving test  signal  l and pocket parking  road test  or the traffice department will suggest on your application form to go to a driving school for two week  hope this help 
as far a i know  there s no problem with you convert a uae license to a qatari one  i know a lot of people have do it the only test you will have to undergo be the eye test  and they will be more than happy to convert your license to a qatari one   
you can drive on a international driver for six month no problem and when you do a visa run it start again 
i have a omani license and no rp a it be take time  i go to traffic department and they give me a temp license after eye test and say once you get rp we will convert that into permenant license  as far a i know and i might be wrong if you come to qatar on residence visa you can only drive for 7 day before convert your license into qatari  temp  visit visa be another story beast666 
thanks beast666  rgds asd

qatar living lounge is ql now the rizks and pajju show  it seem to me that every topic be now get hijack by rizks and pajju  im all for a bit of hijack  cos it can lead to other discussion  but these two clown just destroy every topic into a stupid dim witted conversation about bollox  c mon guy  just dont hijack to get point  please add some idea and thought into the chosen topic  
 no comment on that one a sometimes im guilty of hijacking  but mind you  only   sometimes   ha  and i be actually try my best to avoid it from now on a there have be some user lately who get kick out for this reason    please add some idea and thought into the chosen topic     i agree with you on that one mp   
and they have a new queen   i hear  these two girl above me would know who it be  
most of the time  hijack shift the main topic to a different one and then to another different one and so on   
i understand your point alexa  some thread reach up to 3 or so page and when you look at it  i think only the first page stay on the main topic  
come on guys  they be not that bad  be they   emad   
 it just end up a load of old cobbler  and the true meaning of the topic be lose  then people see it  and get feed up of posting    a man may fight for many things his country  his friend  his principle  the glisten tear on the cheek of a golden child  but personally  i d mud wrestle my own mother for a ton of cash  an amusing clock and a sackful of porn    blackadder   
well i do agree  they even hijack a thread i be consider seriously  but  what can we tell them to do   emad   
   2  hijacking  a  there be issue raise to u on serious hijacking of thread  though the question may have be answer or you know the person who post the thread  it be not acceptable to hijack any thread  unless it have be announce in the beginning a a hijack thread  the reason be that the question may be important to most reader and the essence of the topic be lose due to serious hijacking  hijacking defeat the purpose of our mission of information dissemination  b  i know most of u  include me  still have the hang over from our successful christmas party  victory party and birthday party  however  we should not use this   high   to hijack each and every thread open from then    hinay hinay   lang because most other readers members can not relate to them and sometimes personal joke can be read a demeaning  immoral and indecent by others who can not relate  and this do n t reflect well on the group  as i have say what you write leave an impression of you on th    
maybe if they start to hijack less threads    emad   
to ease up a bit on the hijack maybe

qatar living lounge drinking in qatar  i want to know what the law be about drink there  is there a licence that allow you to drink a certain amount etc   what about contractor for company over there  is there a certain limit to drink etc  any info that be real please let me know  thanks 
yes you can drink in hotel bar or get a liqour license and you have a ration per month depend on your salary 
licenses be for purchase alcohol from qatar distribution company  to get it you require salary certificate from your company with the follow detail  1  basic salary  min 4500   2  wether company provide accomodation else mention allowance detail  thats all it take religion doesnt matter    
so say that you get a license do that mean you can drink at any bar  what be the normal limit for a contractor  
a license to purchase alcohol mean you buy booze from qdc and drink in your house  you dont need a license to drink in a bar  
and for your information religion do matter  no muslims be give alcohol permit  
depends on how much the contractor can drink    
if a contractor get a license and decide to drink at a bar they can go to any bar  
smoke   paleezz dont rub that bull shit here  i be one and i have my license why bother  why dont you call qdc urself to find out  
i didnt know they suddenly change the rule for muslim to buy booze  
well i do n t know what qdc be  also i be ask because all i know be i be tell that you have to get a license to drink  
doha shopping hi friend  who be the best mineral water supplier  deliver at house who be best in the market when it come to supply 5 gallon water at house  i be tell sabeel water be do good and their service be also good than others  what do you all say  i need to set up one service for my house  pls suggest 
well in my opinion almanhal be the best  about home delivery that you have to check with them but i guess there shouldnt be a problem if ur prepare to order some good no  
al manhal water factory co  ltd  wll  tel  4603332  
rayyan claim to be the only company in qatar who supply 5 gallon mineral water  
yeah sabeel be the best supplier and also the water taste well  i have try manhal before  sorry to say  bad service and the water be just like any other tap water  i try few other water like aqua cool and safa  not so great  rayyan be an exception but little too expensive  anyways i be happy with sabeel and dont intend to change even if they increase their price  so i strongly recommend sabeel water  tel no 4606980 contact their sale manager by the name anil  very helpful  he will set up a service for you  and dont forget to give my name a ref  a i will get two free bottle  just kidding  
nestle be very good and reliable  ph 4503332  
al jazeera pure drinking water be also the best  their container be all new  their service staff be polite  they have a timely delivery so you wont worry wether you re out or still have spare container leave not consume  they will only replenish your empty container  no more to hurry for call them at time you have water shortage  besides  they be offer one  1  free stand water cooler dispenser for free upon your first time availment of buy 2 booklet water coupon  at a cost of qar1100 00 for 200pcs 5 gallon bottle  it s worth more than a service and the pure healthy water  i just have avail of it two week ago  i have a new cooler dispenser now  call them at tel  4509555 fax  4509444 or email them at  info  aljazeerawater com for more query  simply call anwar hussain with mobile  6191064 for additional info  i highly recommend al jazeera water for you  
i would not totally agree with sajaryan say that almanhal be like tap water  it one of the best but i do agree that sabeel be good  co we have the brand in our office and it distibuted by international water co w l l 
not nestle water  although their water taste good  their service be horrible  plus  they be at least 2 4 riyal more expensive per bottle than other company  
yes  hukk be right  nestle be not good with their service  infact  i come to know that manhal and nestle belongs to the same group  manhal do the filling for nestle  no wonder why they have such lousy service  to answer mr vengal  i dont agree that manhal be the best  if u r use a dispenser with their bottle  you will be surprise to see red color plastic piece inside the water tank and at time it be visible in your glass too when you pour the water out from the faucet  thats coz the red cap what they use on their bottle be not spill proof  when u put the bottle upside down on your dispenser  the cap get puncture and blow into piece and it end up in your water  i guess only rayyan and sabeel us spill proof cap  and hence it safe  
too bad you guy havent find nestle reliable  ive be use them for 8 month and they have never fail  infact a couple of time id forgotten to take the bottle out and wasnt home  a they ususally knock if you dont leave the bottle out  and ive rang them and they hav come the next day to deliver  i guess everyone have different experiences  
qatar living lounge saturday night in doha  qube nightclub  hi all  me and some friend from london be look to come over to doha for a couple of week  whats the party scene like on friday and saturday night  i hear that in qatar nobody go out on saturday  be that true  where would you go for rnb and hiphop  and ive heard alot about a club call qube be it any good  any feedback would be welcome thanks  
if you enjoy filipino cover band and lot of asian variety in the crowd then the qube be great  however if you enjoy more of the western flair you be down to garvey s  rugby club  and rydges  of these your best bet for fri and sat night  my opinion  so no flame from anyone  be go to be rydges  the bar be under new aussie management with the goal of much good music and faster service  this past weekend be quite busy and the music be good enough to dance to  so there you hav it  one recommendation 
go to beirut  thats where the clubing be i always tell the truth  even when i lie 
is pretty good on a thursday night  nice crowd of people and a good british band  not club though  for club there be only the pearl  with the awful dj jojo  and cloud nyn where the crowd be very very young  i guess if you want club you really do have to go to beirut  
 not good idea to come to have a party in qatar  qatar be a   muslim   country  muslims be not allow to drink alcohol  be in unnecessary co ed place  coming to qatar to have party be strange  maybe you could save money for other purpose other than party   
i agree with tyler and bbksiu  although the best way to enjoy your weekend in doha be by get together with friend in one of our house  have dinner  bbq  and drink  alcohol  you can buy alcohol if you have the license  play some game  e g  risk and card  watch the late dvd  you can put music on and dance  becareful your neighbor      and if you too drink to go home  your friend can get you a lift  or there always a taxi  so you not worry to get cought on drunk and driving  
someone agree with me  that never happen  perhaps i take my mediaction today and have a rare lucid think  p 
 amaru immortal  clubs  i mean night club  here in qatar be no comparison to what you d find in a non muslim country  they both serve alcohol  have music  live djs  but that s where the comparison end    where would you go for rnb and hiphop    take a plane and go somewhere else     i d suggest heat or mercury lounge in melbourne for rnb hip hop      bit of promotion from an ex employee  if you still wan na come to the middle east for clubbing  go to beirut or istanbul  maybe even cairo for that matter  or go to goa  india if you wan na spend xmas at trance party on the beach  or go pub hopping in bangalore    i hear that in qatar nobody go out on saturday  be that true    true  we go out on thursdays  that s the weekend here  happy hour start at 5 30pm   
it suck 
thanks for the info  i have friend in doha and they say that there be a rumour that two top london djs  one playing hiphop rnb the other playing house will be perform  if anyone have far info that would be great  
for the coolest and the noisy place in doha  qube be the place    they ve get the crowd with the ohh la la band    check this out  www mocha com ph they be the performer  
socialising best night club in doha hi everyone  would like to have an opinion about the night club here in doha and which be the best  i ve be to irish harp so far which be good but it get quite suffocate due to lot of smoke  any other recommendation   and if at all there be a membership  how much would that be  i do not have to pay at irish the last time i visit  d thanks  cheers

hi much batter u give her boil water mean norwal water but bil first and then it normal give her god give her long life an good health pray 4 her bye jan 
you can use any certified brand  all use same r o system with  cl  uv   i usualy prefer nestele since they have good quality control and system  
evian be very good 
i normally boil the water that come in big cans  bottles i dont use it directly for my 7month old baby the brand like masafi  rayyan  manhal be safe  as far a i have use it for my baby since her birth but yes  a a precautionery measure  i do boil before add similac powder  
 hi  i strongly recommend evian  it s a bit more expensive than other water but it s worth it and you find it in all carrefours  you can never be sure about other producer here unfortunately  if you decide to go for another brand  make sure sodium content be less than 20  we just arrive here a month ago from the uk too and my 6 month old be on evian  my 5 year old be also on it when she be little  also  what formula be you use  they be not always identical to uk one  i try nestle s nan but it give her green poo so we switch to aptamil and she seem to be fine now  i do n t know if it s your first baby but in case it be  do n t worry to much about what be so call   recommend milk intake be    both my daughter always take at least 30  less than be recommend for their age and their weight have still be absolutely normal  feel free to send me a personal message if you need more advice   
maybe your grandson still adjust with the situation and the weather here  because it happen also to my baby when we be travel  she didn t drink her milk like before  but after few day everything be back to normal  and for the water i recommend nestle  or masafi  good luck

moving to qatar be tap water drinkable after boil  i experience 2 time that the water after boil have a certain smell like disinfector  do they control the quantity of chemical in water treatment  is it ok to drink the tap water after boil  
 even if they say the bacteria will die after boil  id still say no  i wont drink from tap water especially here in qatar where dust be inevitable  silent   g    
then you use bottle water for cooking as well  
 yes goodluck  me and my flatmate use this 5 gallon water for cooking  and why not  we use bottled water in everything pertinent to the food we eat  silent   g    
i will try to use bottle water for food  goodnight  
each year they publish a report detail the mineral etc find in the tap water here  i have be here for 4  year and it have always pass with fly color and find safe than water in most american city  i always use tap water for food preparation and have use it for drink numerous time  although i prefer the taste of bottled water  
apparently the water here be too hard and could damage the kidney after a while  but this be what i hear  i m not really sure if it be true  i d rather play it safe and not drink tap water  i do n t even give it to my cat  i guess i m afraid of the vet bill   
i should be ur cat   so  to whom i should listen  
so you use bottled water to brush  rinse your mouth  wash your dish  glasses                                       
duhh  of course not  i just wo n t drink the water if i can avoid it  i m not paranoid about it  though  but i d rather avoid have kidney problem in the future  
 try take the disinfectant out of the glass before you drink  should stop the taste     it be dangerous to be sincere unless you be also stupid     george bernard shaw  1856 1950
