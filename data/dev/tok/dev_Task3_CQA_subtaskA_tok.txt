Regards ;	U5151	shehabi	2013-07-31 02:27:08	Q268_R16_C4	Well Arman ; nothing is wrong here with banks ; I feel they are not up to par with UAE bank in terms of service at least not with the best which is abu dhabi islamic bank ; but I have made an extensive review of QIB ; IBQ ; QNB and CBQ . I found out that QNB and CBQ are very dynamic ; gives you a lot for cheap . My needs are : -Free Current account with no minimum balance with 2 debit card -Good credit card with airport lounge and added benefit -0 % payment plan at good retaillers -Excellent mobile and internet banking -Cheap ATM and transfer for abroad ... For the above ; QNB and CBQ are the best . But it really depends on your salary too . IBQ is not very good . QIB is ridiculous .	Good	U5153	westernindoha	2013-08-01 11:38:21

Regards ;	U5151	shehabi	2013-07-31 02:27:08	Q268_R16_C10	Sheabi ; the reason behind it ; is that most people in QL have very low income ; hence everytime a bank will take them a penny even a very justified one for a rendered service they will call them robbers ... Also bank may not have the same level of service if you earn 2000 or 25000 ... I would advise you to find a the right branch and the right customer service agent ; and stick to him to build a relationship .

If your really lucky turtles . Anywhere north of Ras Laffan should be good . I was at Umm Tais Natural Reserves ( mentioned in post above - turn right at Al-Shammal and head east ; first island is Ras Rakkan and is harder to get to ; go past until a hamlet and past this you can access Umm Tais ) a few weeks ago ; interesting place but Fuwarait is easier to get to etc . `` `` Sandy '' '' beach we used to go to ; Al-Dhakriah mangroves . There is generally less to see on west coast than the east coast unless you go to places near construction which for the east coast is now a lot ! ! Hence i recommend French beach / fuwarait . There are also a few nice locations you can snorkell in the inland sea ; although currents at certain times are very very strong .

It is a crazy place but a place which loves music and a place which is confident of itself ( not surprising given its ancient history ) .

Celestvile ; sounds like all the expat community lives in Maadi ; and whilst I have heard that it is a quiet area with lots of greenery ; I doubt it 's convinient for us to live there as it is quite a ride from Giza ; where my husband works . We shall see ... we heard 6 October area is also nice ? Besides ; our housing allowance will only be $ 1500 ; which I think does n't strech for a place in Maadi ; and after living in a small flat for the last three years ; I 'm looking forward to a big place with a garden .

I know many people who resigned from their jobs hoping they will get the visa quickly and took up to 4 months . I work at HMC ; they have their own immigration section and yet still they got me a visa in 6 weeks ! ! ! ! ! so DO NOT ever ever ever resign your job and stay home until you really see your visa number with your two eyes ; ) Good luck	PotentiallyUseful	U2437	dentist	2006-08-13 12:52:18

You can go to the private hospitals but they are much more expensive unless you have insurance that cover them . Both my kids were completely vaccinated in Doha ( born here ; now 1 and 3 ) . The only concern might be transferring the records to your home country when you return . Each country has different vaccine schedules . But ; if you are here for a while you might as well do the Doha schedule and finish it all here . For example ; in the US they do n't do BCGs ; but since I figured my kids would be here the first few years of their lives so it was probably a good idea to do it . I 'm pretty sure you do n't need all the vaccines before arriving in Doha . Check with your employer ; but I ca n't imagine they will turn away your 3 month old w/o vaccines since I know they do n't check vaccines for adults at all !	Good	U1606	USAexpat	2009-03-27 20:12:49

For vaccination u need green card for the kid ; for that u have go to Health commision back side of Hamad hospital ( from sports R/A to Fire station R/A ; take right turn from Fire station R/A ) approaching 200 mts one very big building . But yesterday she asked me r u from india ; then she told it 's in other place ; i.e opp to Aldana hotel near sana R/A ; one more medical commission is there . But they will give green card only and after that u have to go to u r regular health center ; they will give the registrastion no and vaccination timings details . note : for issuing green card they need previous vaccination history record from u r county . if u have any doubts call to medical commision near aldana hotel @ 4312054 Thanks	Good	U5213	trimurthi	2010-01-06 10:53:03

You do n't specifically need any extra vaccinations as long as you are up to date with the usual ones you have in the UK ( not sure about US ) but you can have Rabies as optional if you want . Although there is no requirement or need to have any extra protection here ; it is important to remember that lots of people travel East on holidays and if you do you will need the standard typhoid ; yellow fever ; etc . Children need to have been vaccinated against TB before they can start school . In the UK they no longer give BCG so important to get that done before you come .

That said ; the UK has a vey hands off approach to immunisation at the moment as most diseases are sufficiently covered by herd immunity ( where because the majority have been vaccinated the people who have n't are covered to a large extent ) and cases are low .

We got a Saluki pup from there for our daughter and he is now a grown dog ; an absolute darling and a stress reliever for my daughter and everyone else in the house . When we got him ; he was not even a month old and his eyes were not yet foccused . I understand his parents were running wild on a farm and the cops came ; rounded them up and shot the parents ; but Paws and Claws saved many of the orphaned pups and brought them to their centre . We paid them only QR 100/-as donation for the pup . He had diarrohea and needed treatment thereafter . There are good vetinary clincs in Doha ; but still it is a bit expensive . Even then ; it is worth spending on a pup which your daughter can cuddle ; hug and love .

Please save yourself a lot of heartache and stay away from dogs and puppies in the souqs . They are normally sick ; not vaccinated or too young .

I think the insurance companies might have agreements with the insurance carriers and direct buyers to a particular insurance agency . Invariably you will return to the insurance company you used when you bought the car . When the annual renewal comes up though you may find that it is way higher than 3 % ! Or else we were n't skilled/persistent enough to negotiate it down to 3 % : ) Here is a short blog about our experience with car insurance renewal . http : //tinyurl.com/elmrk from my blog about life in Qatar : http : //www.xanga.com/BBetz	Good	U836	BBetzinQatar	2006-03-09 15:18:40

U5248	beefy	2006-03-09 05:14:20	Q276_R27_C6	Life only can be understood backwards ; but must be live forward . Car insurance not really that bad . In the UK you insure the driver ... in here you insure the car . So anyone can drive the car and still insured . If you know what i mean . We pay around 2000 QR for our cars . Again our car are not a posh car . : - )	Good	U188	novita77	2006-03-20 13:13:50

U5248	beefy	2006-03-09 05:14:20	Q276_R27_C9	Car Insurance is quite different from Western practices . As noted above ; you insure the car ; not the driver ; which is one of the reasons kids here can afford to drive massive landcruisers ; despite the slaughter of pedestrians . ( Blood money for non-Moslems is pretty minimal ; anyway . ) For cars over a certain age ; ( 2 years ? Dunno ) 3rd party is the only option . however ; and again as noted above ; cover for passengers is not automatic so check these things carefully with your Insurance Broker . Even the possibility of having residual alocohol in your bloodstream when some idiot slams into you some morning has to be specifically covered ; so it 's not a bad idea to go to a reputable international Insurance company if you think you might occasionally have non-family passengers or drink beer of an evening .

Additionally ; as stated ; you can insure against being over the limit ( excess alcohol ) ; although I do not know what would happen if a driver was drunk and had an accident .

I think the beach deserve our respect and protection ; I 'm not criticizing ; but the damage is done ; and action and not words need to be taken ; every time I go there I bring my trash ; and some times pick some plastic bottles around . Now there is a big dump of sand ; maybe for construction . In a Country almost like an Island ; not having a proper beach to go ; is a shame .

I for one ALWAYS pack out my garbage ; always bury and disperse my campfire and practice zero impact camping and picnicking . I know many others that do the same but the amount of litter I 've seen thrown out the window of Landcruisers suggests that prevention needs to be seen as the biggest part of the solution . Please do n't try to lay guilt trips on me for these ones . When I start to see convoys of Qataris taking pride in and cleaning up their own country ( and not paying Sri Lankans a pittance to do it for them ) ; I 'll gladly stop and lend a hand . -- Since Allah has given me a brain ; it would seem like a sin not to use it .

If you only want to see sea beach then Dukhan is ok . There are no sharks but there are Channa Fish at Dukhan . Beware of Channa Fish ! They are very dangerous ; especially during the onset of winter . They generally do n't attack humans ; but if they are hungry they may eat humans ! This happens especially when the Channa grows old and lazy and does n't want to hunt ; then they come near the beach to grab easy prey ( the human bathers ) . If you want to be safe from the Channa eat lots of Garlic and apply Garlic spray on your body because ; the only thing that can repulse a Channa is Garlic ! Have a nice swim at Dukhan ! Cya .

Also you mentioned manure ; you do n't use manure on indoor plants ; I hope you meant soil . I also use a liquid fertilizer once in a while and I save water bottles and fill with water and leave for my house plants that way the chlorine goes out and the temp is room temperature when you water once a week . Sometimes the plants you get here are not good quality when you buy them so it does n't take much to kill them . I had gardenias in the house and within a few months they had outgrown the pot ; root bound so I planted them outside in a big pot and they are great now . There is a garden club here you can join and get help and then you will know what plants are easy to grow ; like the spider plant cleans your air so its good to have as a house plant .

The red blood cells can perform this task because of the presence of hemoglobin ; the pigment that is formed when the red blood cells develop in the bone marrow . Each hemoglobin molecule is made up of a protein molecule called globin and four pigmented molecules of a compound called heme . Each heme molecule has one atom of iron ; and there are four heme molecules in a single molecule of hemoglobin ; hence ; a single molecule of hemoglobin has four atoms of iron . This structure makes it possible for one hemoglobin molecule to join with four oxygen molecules to form a substance called oxyhemoglobin .

Are there some simple restaurants to go to if you do n't want to cook dinner at night ? Or ; are there cafes to walk to just to relax ? I 'm not interested in any heavy disco scenes . Are there neighborhoods in Al Khor ? Usually if there are neighborhoods ; there are small shops and cafes ; right ? Is this what the place is like ? Thanks for the help .

In the Philippines there are more schools that caters children with special needs.If we educate them ; they can be independent in time as they grow old . Try to search for the movie I am Sam ; its about a father with mild mental retardation who nurtura and love his child.He works a lot to earn for a living to help him send her child to school and to have better future . This is a touching and heart pounding story how a mental challenged father strive to have her little girl . Hope you like this film .	PotentiallyUseful	U5291	norkin	2009-12-03 13:10:50

They come here without having an idea about our culture and religion . All they think about is how much salary they will take . We as a Qataries feel worried about the thousands of outlandish people and we try to be open with others but if they respect our culture and our land . What do u think.. ?

When the city became the Christian Constantinople in 330 AD ; its Crescent assumed the significance of an attribute of the Virgin Mary . In 1299 ; conquering what is now Turkey ; Sultan Osman had a vision of a crescent moon stretching over the world ; it thus became a symbol of the Ottoman dynasty ; and when Constantinople fell to Muhammad II in 1453 ; the crescent came to represent both Islam and the Turkish empire .

But yes since the driver was new he was'nt familiar with where I was going so I have to tell the directions . Other than that I have no problem with getting a taxi from them !

Q285_R25	Qatar Living Lounge	Al Million Taxi Service	Had anyone taken rides with Karwa 's new franchised taxis operated by Al Milllion ? I have yet to take a rdie in one of these new franchised taxis . So I do n't know about their services . Are the drivers better behaved than those from Karwa or Mowasalat ? Wonder whether Mowasalat had made any effort to oversee complaints regarding Al Million in order to further enhance the quality of service . Any comment ?

Yesterday I took a Million cab from Lulu to just two signals away ( Near Falcon Petrol Station ) . He did'nt know where mall round about is . He did'nt know how to change lanes . The lady behind honked like hell and showed her sour face through the window . Somehow I managed to reach my house..I feel pity for these drivers as they are very new to this place and desperate to make a living . Hope it goes well after sometime without too many casualities ... The taxi was new and clean . The driver was courteous and very obliging.He only took 10 Riyals ; where Karawa guys take 12- 15 Riyals . I welcome Million Taxi ; with all its faults . Doha really needed a competitor for Karwa .

U5334	LewisHamilton	2011-04-03 04:03:37	Q287_R11_C3	LewisHamilton ; Here is an honest report : Be prepared to often put your patience levels beyond your limits in many daily situations . The driving here is insane and extremely risky . The professionalism levels are quite substandard when compared to the developed world . Services here are generally very poor . You will witness all around you ; extremisms of social segregation and exclusion ; where laborers and maids are marginalized and excluded from the main stream society . During the summer months ( May to September ) the heat is extreme ; it can reach + 50 C. Many people leave Qatar and those who stay ; stay indoors . During those months ; life is all about work ; home and shopping malls . No rain and sand storms instead . Your home and car will be covered with fine brown dust ( as thin as cement or talc powder ) when can damage your electronic appliances and your health . You 'll always have to be aware and think of how not to offend ( such as what you wear ; what you say ; what you drink and eat and when ... ..	Good	U2525	Nic	2011-04-03 07:56:52

Beaches here look nice in pictures but often there are not that great ( mainly because of the sand which is earthy dusty and the extreme heat starting in May . Here in Doha city ; they destroyed all public beaches and all we have left are the hotels ( Intercontinental Hotel ; perhaps the most popular ; not necessarily the best as the beach is artificially prepared the sea floor is construction debris covered with algae . Recently they have built a series of artificial beaches ; between the Intercontinental and the Pearl ; in Qatara ( a cultural village partially operating ) .

Thanks	U5348	INDIAN	2007-08-06 22:28:56	Q288_R61_C7	Bibs ; your topic message above is not really accurately describing safety in Qatar . This instance ; that happened with your wife ; almost happens almost everywhere in other countries . If I am taking a cab in Cairo ; where I live ; I will get tons of offers to hop into someone’s car . Not necessarily because I am pretty ; but because girls are hit on generally speaking . I’ve been here in Doha for a couple of years ; with family or without ; faced the usual hassles . Downsides : Persistent car followers . At malls guys throw their cell phone numbers at girls . In bars some guys impose themselves ; but usually there are guards . On the beach guys stare and offer company with no pressure . On the Cornich ( for long walks ; jogging and workouts ) guys may try to talk to her . But if the girl is serious enough ; no one can catch up with here speed to begin with ; unless he is a highly athletic trainer or something… ) Generally men stare ; specifically from certain down trodden ex-pats from some least deve ... ..

Even going to the Fruit and Vegetable Market ; where in any case ; it is much better if you have company with you ; not because people stare ; but they are used to dealing with men as mostly on Friday the men do the shopping . Wherever you go ; if they recognise you are foreigner ; ( because you are different ) they will look at you and the inflation will rise 200 % in every shop ( at least they will try ) . Qatar is no different than any other country but a lot more safe if you behave naturally you will not be molested . One thing more - on the streets it is very much a mans ' world and your will see relatively few women going alone shopping ; so for many people this is really strange . I go to a small supermarket nearly everyday to buy milk and the boy insists on carrying the one bottle to my car ; this alway makes me feel foolish as I am ... ..

Q297_R32	Qatar Living Lounge	TATA SAFARI in Qatar	Why TATA SAFARI is not available in Qatar ? ?	U2	anonymous	2009-04-19 01:41:56	Q297_R32_C9	`` TATA are known to be a business house with solid Ethics.. TATA cars have proven to be success in Indian MArket . There Indica was the only car in India which challenged the dominance of Maruti Suzuki 800 ; which was enjoying the maximum market share . TATA NANO has shown to the world their Engineering superiority . Something even the Germans or Japanese Couldn Do . Safari is a Good Vehicle . But the problem in Qatar is - People are not hardworking enough to actually see which vehicle does well on road ... They follow the crowd ... n Also there is blind following of American Brands n Japanese ... You sell a toy car labelled `` '' made in America '' '' And the so called Qataries will buy tht in Whole sale.. to boasts About tht fact tht they own American Stuff ... . Why you think Skoda is not a much accepted brad here very much like TATA ... . First see the vehicle and then Comment ... . If a vehicle can run on Indian Roads ( sorry not roads.. supposedly roads ) It can drive in any country ; ... trust me ... . ''	Good	U3339	ashwindoke	2009-04-19 08:50:47

'' '' Chickens hatch from eggs ; but eggs are laid by chickens ; making it difficult to say which originally gave rise to the other . To ancient philosophers ; the question about the first chicken or egg also evoked the questions of how life and the universe in general began . 1 Cultural references to the chicken and egg intend to point out the futility of identifying the first case of a circular cause and consequence .

In a question that is phrased differently ; the answer would be different . Similarly ; Randy Garner jokingly refers to an encyclopedic solution : [ 18 ] “ These supporters call attention to the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary ( 2001 ) . Upon careful examination of the entries and accompanying definitions ; one can accurately assert that “chicken” is found on page 232 ; while “egg” is not found until page 398 .

When you are in Doha ; get the application for temporary license and submit it to the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department along with copy of your US license and passport pages showing your identity and visa page You might need to get an NOC from the sponsor ( Typed in Arabic ) if you visit here under visa from some company or sponsor .

U5442	maggie	2007-02-26 04:38:52	Q304_R26_C1	I would advise you to pick a different place . Many people will view you as nothing but a prostitute in Qatar . Yes Doha is a tough city to live in and the cost of living will cause you to save little to nothing each month . Plus they are n't going to pay you what you 're worth because you are Chinese . Chinese are put into the lower-income bracket in Qatar - that is just the way it is over here . Not fair ; I know . If you do go ... do n't let them take your passport from you because then you may find yourself working at the Oasis just so you can buy back your freedom . I hope this helps .

Nothing of substance here whatsoever . Here you have an entire displaced foreign population - all here for working only ! There is no culture here . Work is the culture . As for the geography ... the worst found anywhere in the world . No trees ; no rivers ; no lakes ; no mountains ; lots of traffic though ; terrible climate ; etc . etc . Combine that with no fun at all ; unfair pay based on your nationality ; and the surrender of your passport . If that is your idea of enriching your life ... go for it !

U5442	maggie	2007-02-26 04:38:52	Q304_R26_C7	Lots of jobs ... . Salaries in the same field vary a lot with nationality . Qatar taxes income by housing rent ( 50 % mininum ) so if you manage to get a job make sure the company houses you or at least pays you the amount of your rent ( even if it increases ) . You will need QR 1000 for food & other expenses if single . Anything above that you can save ; depending on how much you want to save . I would say the minimum one should ask for should be QR 2000 above the Rent ; else you would be really wasting your time and youth . Although there are Construction workers who work for QR700 which would be roughly what they earn in their own countries . ( SriLankans & Nepalis mostly come here to get away from the civil war in their countries so they are willing to work for so low . ) Qatar is booming in 2 sectors Oil/Gas and Construction . 1st is Nationalised so you may find it difficult to get into . The second is not a boom its a BLAST . Theres always jobs in Construction Companies . All other services are growing ... ..	Good	U2	anonymous	2007-02-26 09:21:41

Then logically ; the universe is supposed to come back to its original state at some point of time..who knows . I have tried but could never understand 'quantum Fluctuations ' which is said to be the reason for the big bang out of a singularity . Further ; the 'anti-matter ' and 'negetive energies ' are still theoretical concepts . If the same are proven someday ; it would further help us to understand if the universe will die at all . But ; at present ; it is a general opinion that universe will keep on expanding and may freeze out when all stars would become either black holes ; neutron stars or white dwarfs .

Hello guys..I want to take NHA licensure ( Nurse ) here in Qatar but I dont have any work experience in the Philippines..I 'm currently working here now as a nurse in a construction company for almost 1yr..Will NHA allowed me to take licensure here even if I do n't have the necessary experience required ? Help please..thanks a lot and godbless..	U5449	m0kz12	2011-05-12 22:12:41	Q306_R20_C8	I think work experience is not a prerequisite for taking the NHA exam that is now handled by Prometric . You can try to schedule the exam online . However ; there 's no point of taking the exam without the required work experience since it is one of the requirements to get NHA license . Moreover ; if you pass the exam ; the validity is only for 2 years ; otherwise you have to take it again .	Good	U5452	ecabs	2011-05-13 09:59:01

They collect the vomit and leave the dog alone and the vomit is used as a topping for a very special rice dish during ceremonial feasts . And BTW ; they eat dogs ; crows ; rats etc in some parts of the north east too . So `` '' dog meat curry '' '' and `` '' dog puke '' '' is an Indian dish .

And an older Camry is nothing to worry about ; a 2009 Camry is pretty much just starting it 's life..4 years is nothing for a Toyota engine and there are Camrys with 800000kms still running around happily with no problems..You 'll probably die long before your Camry does haha	Good	U1086	mohdata	2014-03-06 15:05:13

You can take it for an evaluation to the Bosch Service Center where for 500 Qr . they will give you a bumper to bumper report on the condition of the car..you 'll need to leave it with them for half a day though..I suggest its money and time well spent to ensure you get a good reliable car..

Thanks	U1988	AlanCarr	2010-09-01 15:58:21	Q310_R52_C8	Hi Alan ; you might wan na re look at the difference in intrest rates between a car loan approx 3.4 % as compared to approx 9 % for a personal loan . If you check with manager ( not sales guy ) of GMC they can get the car down from DXB for you . I hear the drive down is no fun either and not too safe too . Just curious why would you like to drive a manual car when you can go in for a triptronic instead . With the increase in traffic an auto is de way to go ( just my oponion )	Good	U5479	Cy	2010-09-01 18:44:51

My name is n't Alan either ; but it 'll do for this forum : ) B2D ; driving is always fun ; I love cars ; always have . Plus its an adventure ; never done it before : ) Cy ; I know about the rates ; but the actual monthly payment costs are n't too different ; yes I pay more overall ; but I can accept that for the convenience it gives me in choosing the car I want . I 'm a Brit ; I grew up driving manuals and its a more compelling experience than having an automatic decide when to change gear . I bought the car ; I 'll decide when to change . Personal opinion on Triptronics is they are there for show ; and they still are n't as good as a manual box . The wannabe Schumacher 's of this world can have them ; I 'll stick with a standard 6 speed box thanks . Easier to hang the arse out of a RWD V8 when you can control the gearbox ; not a sodding computer . : )	Bad	U1988	AlanCarr	2010-09-01 20:12:50

I studied in Pakshama from 80 to 88 but it was n't so bad that time . We had mostly Indian teachers so the standard of English was pretty good . But then somewhere end of the 80 's or beginning of 90 's they removed all Indian teachers and hired Pakistani teachers so their standard detoriated in a few months . I shifted to PEC in 88 or 89 and I was shocked to see Pathan teachers who could not speak or write English properly . They were pathetic in grammar and pronunciation . In 1996 I got a job at Bright Future when they had just opened . I have seen their method and standard of teaching very closely.. They are just as bad as the other two .

However note that some new houses have high rents ( 'cause they 're new and big ) but are located in crap areas ! For a good place in a compound or high building you need at least 15'000 QR ; and many of those places already have waiting lists . Prices however are not comparable to rentals in other countries . There 's shortage of good accommodations which increases the rates ; it 's not that housing is better in Doha then elsewhere . If your employer wo n't take care of it ; best is to come here and take a look by yourself ... Good luck .	Good	U5492	Puppy78	2008-09-07 13:04:53

It is not necessary that the facilities will be very good if you are paying a bigger rent . I think now a days the rents are depending on the locations and not on the facilities . There are some areas in Qatar where you have to pay 7-8k per month for a two bedroom accommodation and there are some areas where you will be asked for 10-12k for two bedroom accommodation with the same facilities .

You should negotiate on the part where the company provide insurance for the entire family . No logic in them providing insurance just for you . Second ; do negotiate the car allowance coz if you plan to rent a car ; a good vehicle ; say a honda civic would cost you qrs . 2500. a 4WD would cost you much more . Third ; do check where your working base is going to be . Is it in Al Khor ? If yes ; it is a nice location along with a community where your family will feel at home .

If true ; do these restrictions extend to coffee shops ; supermarkets ; movies & other places . Also if true ; why on earth is there such a rule ?

I already visited the company and I was thrilled with the place and the employees ; they are extremely nice and helpful which you do n't really find in much TV stations so it is a blessing . As per your concern about accomodation ; from what I heard is that all employees who are married and have children are provided with a very decent villa in a compound and single employees are provided with a 3 bdrm furnished apartment in a nice place as well . After all aljazeera has a big name and I dont think they will throw their employees ( their best resources ) in a place that is unfit or unsafe . Good luck and I hope to see you there .

You can never be sure about other producers here unfortunately ... if you decide to go for another brand ; make sure Sodium content is less than 20 . We just arrived here a month ago from the UK too and my 6 months old is on Evian . My 5 year old was also on it when she was little . Also ; what formula are you using ? they are not always identical to UK ones . I tried Nestle 's NAN but it gave her green poo so we switched to Aptamil and she seems to be fine now . I do n't know if it 's your first baby but in case it is - do n't worry to much about what is so called `` '' recommended milk intake is '' '' - both my daughters always took at least 30 % less than was recommended for their age and their weight has still been absolutely normal .
