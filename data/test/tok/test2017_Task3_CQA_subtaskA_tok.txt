Thanks	U577	Aunt Polly	2008-04-07 06:25:40	Q388_R23_C10	Aunt Polly , my family and I did it . Yes , even if you check with DHL or Fedex , they know it , and they know what to do . But you 'll have to complete your papers adn plan your trip well , as the processing takes ( max ) of 5 working days in all . Yes , you 'll need a separate Schengen Visa for those countries you mentioned ( except Holland ) . The 15 Schengen countries are : Austria , Belgium , Denmark , Finland , France , Germany , Iceland , Italy , Greece , Luxembourg , Netherlands , Norway , Portugal , Spain and Sweden . All these countries except Norway and Iceland are European Union members . When you know your 1st Schengen-visa valid country , that will be your visa application . Say , your 1st destination before or after Swiss is Italy , then you have to get your Schengen Visa from the Italian Embassy here . Once you have the visa , you can roam around 15 countries !

I would be VERY hesitant to travel anywhere in teh world if I did not know what the visa requirements were for a particular country . On the other hand the airline carrying you to Qatar would ultimately be responsible for you and will not allow you to board if your paperwork is not in order . Check out the Qatar Government websites if you have the opportunity . Good Luck .	?	U2578	sa_japie	2006-10-14 15:41:38

They have been 3 times now and have had no problems whatsoever . However , these new regulations have come in to effect ... but as mentioned , speaking to people who had just had visitors they have had no problems and was n't asked to provide anything . If you are a bit nervous ... you can get your friends to organise a meet and greet service for you . You can book them at any Qatar Airways office ... does n't matter what airline you are arriving in . Costs around 70 riyals ( ca n't remember exactly ) and they will meet you when you get off the plane , seat you in a room with refreshments then organise your visa .. you can pay a bit extra ( 10 riyals ) and they will even pick up your luggage for you and escort you thru customs It 's a great service , especially if you are unsure or nervous .

They 're required by law to make sure they 're not carrying undesirable aliens , so it 's in their interest to make sure everything 's in order . I 'm pretty sure you 'll be OK so long as you can persuade immigration that you 're a bona-fide short term tourist , which is why a hotel booking is recommended . It might help to have ask your friends for their job details , address & RP number . ( They 'll know what that is . ) If you 're at all young or attractive , they 'll be suspicious that you might be a prostitute . Note that in all these respects , it 's exactly the same for non-EC tourists entering the UK or Brits entering the USA .	?	U1241	Mr Niceguy	2006-10-14 19:20:39

Thanks , Beth : - )	U58158	BethRÃÂ±chards	2006-10-14 15:15:32	Q388_R28_C9	I have read these comments and decided to join ! This is the first time for me planning to visit some country in the region of the Middle East and I thought it would be better if I get all the needed info in advance . The problem is that I am not sure what kind of visa should I be obtained , as a southeastern European citizen ( but still not in the EU ) , during the visit that I have planned for upcoming December . My girlfriend is employed by a certain company in Doha for past two months and Iâ€™d be staying at her flat for about 3 weeks . I 've heard it is almost illegal being at apartment of a woman with a â€˜singleâ€™ marital status ! Is this possible ? ? Iâ€™d be very grateful if someone could provide me some info about the local regulations or any suggestion considering my case . Thank You in advance for any help provided !	?

Q388_R28	Visas and Permits	Coming to doha next week - need tourist visa !	Hi there , I am coming to doha on Thursday and I know I will need a tourist visa . Someone mentioned that I get it at the airport for 55riyals , is this correct ? I saw on the Qatar Government website that you needed evidence of which hotel you would be staying in ? But I am staying with friends during my stay ? Any advice would be good as I am quite nervous about flying alone and dont want any problems when I arrive !

I am really worried now after what I Have read on here about being accused of being a prostitute or not giving any tourist visas until after games . Im going to ring embassy on Monday and find out once and for all . Can I book that service while in the UK or does someone else need to do it for me and if so can they arrange it when they come to get me from the airport in Doha or does it need to be in advance ?

I will be needing a five door hatchback model , nothing too large or fancy and will be needing to rent for 3 or 4 months . Any advice would be appreciated .

Speedway Rent a car 444-2299 Ask for Michael You can rent a car with your International Driving License . Legally you can drive with this license for 6 months after your first date of arrival in Doha . But each rental car company has different policy . Some rental car company allow you to rent their car with Internatioal Driving License for 2 months , some for a few weeks . So , you must shop around for more detail . Since , you are from the UK I would recommend you to wait for your company to issue you a letter to obtain a local Qatari Driving License . This letter will be in Arabic and you can obtain a new license on exchange basis . They will just look at your local UK license , give you eyes exam then you are done . Just pay the money and you will get the new Qatari license right away . With Qatari License you can rent a car from anywhere with less restrictions . Qatari Driving License Documents Needed 1.Arabic Letter from your company 2.Passport copy with RP copy 3.Color photo ( No white background ) If you war glasses or contact lense , you must wear glass while taking picture . 4.Applicaiton Fee payby credit card or ATM card ( No cash accepted ) 5.Enjoy your new License Goodluck in Doha !	?

After 2 years here , I would consider that the best move I have made sence being here . Had your same creditials , got a car for a month , in the meanwhile looked for a car to buy . You definitely need a car in this city . I do n't care if you pay a cab and you follow it to your place to stay . I beg you to rent a car at the airport . Rules here change like the wind and the person behind the counter , well what they say could change day to day aswell , so get a car. `` if its not a good time , its a good story ''	?

Im quite confused with the 2 months entry and 1 month stay ... ? extension maybe ? ..that might be a business visa i guess . Husband sponsored visa is entirely different because your validity of stay in qatar depends totally on your husband visa status ... ?

U24970	riko	2010-06-17 19:59:14	Q389_R38_C2	hi there ! just some clarifications ... i know those who are in family visit visa have the privilege for a 1 month stay and can get it extended for 5 months . Im quite confused with the 2 months entry and 1 month stay ... ? extension maybe ? ..that might be a business visa i guess . Husband sponsored visa is entirely different because your validity of stay in qatar depends totally on your husband visa status ... ? Maybe what the company meant was they accept applicant or worker for that post only for those with husband visa sponsorship ...

However , relatives who wish to stay beyond one month may undergo a physical examination within the first 72 hours of arrival to apply for an extension . The visa can be extended to cover a maximum of six months only ( five extendable months for immediate family members and two months for second-degree relatives ) .	?	U74	FlyingAce	2010-06-17 21:29:11

U24970	riko	2010-06-17 19:59:14	Q389_R38_C9	Rico , you are totally confused . Your visa is issued on May 2nd . You can enter Qatar within 3 months , i.e . any time till July 31st . If you didn’t enter Qatar during this time , your visa is expired and you have to issue new visa . NOW . Let’s say , you entered Qatar on June 01 . YOU think that you visa is still valid till July 31 , which is wrong . Now your visa validity is calculated from date of your entry . It should be valid 30 days , i.e . if you entered Qatar on June 01 , it is valid till July 01 ( check the entry stamp in your passport ) . You can extend this visa till 6 months upon completion of Medical examination . NOW . Type of your visa is a VISIT visa , meaning that you can not work on this visa . VISIT means VISIT , not work , how people don’t understand it ? ? NOW . If you want to work in qatar , you have 2 options : 1.Husband takes you under his sponsorship and issues a ) Residence permit for you ( although he should meet certain requirements to be qualified to sponsor you ) b ) Work Permit so that you could legally work ; 2.Find a job , and do not even mention your husband , so that the COMPANY can take you under its sponsorship .

If they send her home , you can not hire her directly without an NOC she has to wait for another 3 years before she can enter Qatar again . In that sense , there 's no way you can avoid paying the QR6,000 . If you are going to hire from the agencies you will find out eventually that , you will spend more or less the same amount ! If your instinct say she 's worth it , then go for it ! but if you find it too expensive , as I said there are lots of them looking for job who are already there , it will suit you according to your budget ! ; )	?

Thanks	U7287	Anandg	2012-12-22 10:27:35	Q390_R16_C10	I called and spoke to the sponsor . They paid 7000QAR for her 4 years ago . They want that money back !	?	U7287	Anandg	2012-12-22 19:46:27

U753	Minoush	2011-01-24 21:25:35	Q390_R39_C2	As far as i know , You need to get a NOC letter from your employer , which should state that they have no object to you applying for a maid and also stating your salary , and the nationality of the maid you want to get . Take this to the labour department on C-ring road ( i guess ) , there is an application form that you need to get filled in and submit with the NOC . Will take atleast a week for the approval to come . Once you get the approval , give this to any manpower agency that brings in maids , and they will handle the rest in terms of getting the visa , flights , etc .	?	U302	soniya	2011-01-24 21:59:52

Because when your wife go to hospital for check up and when she will deliver the baby in the hospital , the hospital will ask you to submit the marriage certificate . when you will register to have a Birth Certificate at the Supreme Council for Health they will again ask for the marriage certificate and when you will apply for your baby visa , they will not require for a NOC , just the baby passport , you and your wife passport and RP ID .	?

U28844	Qan123	2007-08-10 14:32:29	Q391_R31_C8	1 . Your husband has to check if he can acquire a visa for a maid under his name . 2 . He has to apply for that visa . 3 . The maid has to be different from your nationality . ( that 's I am not sure if still the current law ) 4 . Once your husband has been approved for his application to sponsor a maid , he then can get the visa transfer form . 5 . He has to ask your father to sign it and your maid to sign it . 6 . Your father has to make a release letter for your maid 7 . You can submit those papers to the Immigration . I hope the above could help you , I am no immigration expert here , I just read those previou thread and gather the above informations from it . I am not sure also , how long it will take ( the processing ) Goodluck ! Cheers !

U2	anonymous	2008-04-17 10:48:07	Q395_R43_C7	Those used to speaking slang might nor notice the gramatical error , but it 's there ( as everyone already ponted out ) . `` He 's '' implying `` he has '' is only used in slang and is technically gramatically incorrect because `` he 's '' is supposed to be a replacement for `` he is '' . Aslo , the term thin vs the term slender is not really a gramatical infrigement ( although I do agree with you that it may have been more appropriate under the current circumstances ) . Stay safe .

I have to pay remaining amount in installments ( 340QR /month ) . If I have to cancel the contract I will loose 40 % of contract value ( i.e . 7200QR ) . It is true that they do n't have any website , and they have informed the the website is under construction . Also there are complaints about this travel agency in Dubai . If anybody know more about this travel agency , please share .	?	U17299	Don_2	2011-12-27 15:43:40

( this is what I did for my family ) The requirement states : If the visitor wants to stay more than one month inside the country , he/ she has to undergo a medical test before the month ends . The visa is renewable for five months for immediate family ( father , mother , sister , sons ) and two months for other relations . Get the official requirement here from Hukoomi website : 1 . Go to Hukoomi . ( you can google it ) 2 . Go to How do I ? 3 . Select get residence visa for family 4 . On the next page , click on `` for more information , click here '' 5 . On list of services , click on `` Visas for Family Visits '' Hope this helps and do your medical ( at the Medical Commission ) soonest . Do n't forget to do the blood grouping first .	?

I failed once and then I took to driving classes ( short course ) just to know what they are looking for on the road test and also mainly because we do not have a lot of roundabouts back in our country . I found out that they are particular about your car 's position before approaching a roundabout when you are going right , left or straight . Try to go into a short course to bring up your confidence .	?	U163	treysdad	2007-12-12 07:16:11

Rather than wasting money by failing in direct test . Join a course .

If it 's your first time , you can download the form from the VSF link above , or as what we do , we download and fill up a draft copy and then fill out the actual form in the VSF office . It 's a loooong form : D Better go first thing in the morning since there 's less queue . Bring all requirements listed , including : letter from company stating your salary/position and tenure official bank statement ( 6 mos i think ) your work visa passport picture marriage contract ( in case ur bringing wife ) and some other ( just pls dbl check in the website ) Always bring the original + photocopy when you get there , after filling up the forms , they will gather all your documents and put it in a sealed envelope -- everything will be couriered to UK in 24 hrs and even the result is sealed when u get it back , so the VSF people do not really have a say on the results . btw , they will also get your fingerprints and picture and signature , all digital . Payment is about 400QR for 6 mos visit visa . Goodluck !	?	U4721	starry_eyed	2010-07-24 13:20:51

U34685	academia	2007-01-23 21:06:35	Q401_R64_C1	Yeah right ! They will hunt us down until the day we die and probably even after that . Here 's a few things from the IRS site . You ( and I ) really need to ask a professional because it 's tricky and I really do n't know what to do . I have read something else before about living out of the country for all but 30 days of the year and that being one of the reasons for exemption but I ca n't find the exact wording ... http : //www.irs.gov/businesses/small/international/article/0 , ,id=97324,00.html If you are a U.S. citizen or resident alien living or traveling outside the United States , you generally are required to file income tax returns , estate tax returns , and gift tax returns and pay estimated tax in the same way as those residing in the United States . Your income , filing status , and age generally determine whether you must file a return . Generally , you must file a return if your gross income from worldwide sources is at least the amount shown for your filing status in the Filing Requirements table in Chapter 1 of Publication 54 , Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad If you are a U.S. citizen or a resident alien of the United States and you live abroad , you are taxed on your worldwide income . However , you may qualify to exclude from income up to $ 82,400 of your foreign earnings . In addition , you can exclude or deduct certain foreign housing amounts .	?	U661	pwb78	2007-01-23 22:43:47

U34685	academia	2007-01-23 21:06:35	Q401_R64_C2	Here 's something else . Let me know if you do talk to a professional because right now I 've been operating on the `` ignorance-is-bliss '' philosophy which is n't that smart ! Significant Penalty Imposed for Not Filing Expatriation Form The Internal Revenue Service reminds practitioners that anyone who has expatriated or terminated his U.S. residency status must file Form 8854 , Initial and Annual Expatriation Information Statement ( PDF ) . Form 8854 must also be filed to comply with the annual information reporting requirements of Internal Revenue Code section 6039G , if the person is subject to tax under Section 877 of the Code . A $ 10,000 penalty may be imposed for failure to file Form 8854 when required . IRS is sending notices to expatriates that have not complied with the Form 8854 requirements , including the imposition of the $ 10,000 penalty where appropriate . The Instructions for Form 8854 ( PDF ) provide details about the filing requirements , related definitions and line-by-line instructions for completing the form . Failure to file or not including all the information required by the form or including incorrect information could lead to a penalty .	?	U661	pwb78	2007-01-23 22:47:16

If you came on Business Visa and stay LESS than 1 month , you still do not need a visa . If you came on Business Visa and stay more than 1 month , you will need an Exit permit . And if you have an RP here , you will DEFINITELY need an exit permit from your sponsor , unless you are under your husband 's sponsorship .

If you know any mandoub , ask him for help and explain that you want to sponsor someone not related to you . Even your travel agent can arrange for it . Al Deera is one example . They can book you in Al Maha Services at the airport . They will provide everything from visa processing up to clearing at immigration here at the airport . You have to check if her nationality is among those who are being granted visa at the airport .

I see from your profile that you 're from the UK so I can say that it 's VERY easy to get a visa . In fact , she gets it on arrival at the airport if she 's British .

They will not tell you rightaway after the meeting regarding the result , you have to wait for 3 days or more . continuously check the result on internet if the remarks will change . if still the same after 5 days then most probably still rejected . Just my advice , they might ask only 3 questions which has something to do with your work or family , even if they ask less make it sure that you express your willingness and your capacity to support your family here .

Few people says like , they wont approve it , no use in meeting the captain , just go through some intermediate person or call this number . Are they say this to us to go through intermediate person , so that they will get the commision like that . If it is some minimal amount means we can bare it . But when I call those numbers they are asking blindly 10000 QAR to 17000 QAR to get the Visa approved . They dont know the value of the money , simply misguiding the peoples to loose the money .

U2223	may	2008-05-22 18:36:32	Q404_R117_C2	hi bowlers21 ! they have already allowed housemaid sponsorship for same nationality . this was since last week of december2007 i think . so if you are interested , you might also wan na try . if you can bring her by visit visa , it will be beneficial on your part so you have to spend much . i know the immigration already squeezed a big amount from you when you applied . to answer your question , yes it is transferable . you will need to pay for QR1800 for the visa issuance for the housemaid . how long will it take ? i dont know . it will depend on your efforts because it is personal sponsorship . good luck ! silent `` G ''	?

I think it should be shut down . I brought my girlfriend there for a date and i was a huge mistake . I almost cried . This is coming from someone who was in Iraq for 13 months . It is depressing and I think that it would be best for you to avoid this attraction . Unless you hate animals ... then have at it . Make yourself Happy and hopefully others will follow .	?

When you get them back just go to the immigration and they will cancel both , the old passport and old visa and issue you a new visa with the same details of the old one .

The normal procedures to report to the police exactly what happend . They will then ask you to return in 2 weeks . Hence given time for the other party to report . If no one report ... you can get the police letter / certificate , with that you can go to the garage to get it fix ( via insurance ) .

The police will just look at the damage make a report and ask you to put a QR5/- stamp . Thats all you just take the paper and go to any garage of your choice . Other wise you may have to wait for a few days sometimes as less as 3 and after that they will give you the report . I think if you are going to claim insurance then you need to pay QR 100/- at the traffic dept I think before they give you the paper to take to the insurance company .	?

I just have a problem with my landlord , as they already asked us to vacate the house . Now , i still have a cheque as a deposit and he still has n't returned it to me . So i went to the bank and asked them to cancel the payment for that cheque . Guess what , they said they ca n't do that unless i go to the police first and get a report .

U13511	klorev2803	2008-05-07 07:40:50	Q410_R111_C7	What the police report is for is should your landlord present the cheque ( out of malice ) is negaite you from the responsiblity . If you stop the cheque without the police report or by not having the money in the account then you are the person responsible and it means that you can be arrested and detained by the police till you make the payment . so your land lord wins if you go to the police present your case and get the report to present to the bank then should your landlord present the cheque then you have done nothing wrong and he can not claim the money and wont be able to claim the money and you wo n't end up in jail .	?

Therefore you dont have a child . 2 . Opening this matter to your HR/ mandoob will put you in trouble ... .kal_el made a point . 3 . Think and ask wisely to your HR/ mandoob , means you are not the subject but your friend . Then you will know their advice and opinion .	?	U1805	Sense Mine	2013-02-19 12:36:20

I did this 7 months ago and lost 10 kilos in two months ( with no excercise ) and it didnt feel like a diet as i was eating three meals a day with morn/afternoon/evening snack and all meals included bread ... there was so much to eat that most days i didnt everything recommended . With diets its not so much how often you eat but just the amount ( portion control ) and the type of food .

It was developed in 1970 by Dr. Alan Howard at Cambridge University , United Kingdom as a method of rapidly shedding weight while reducing loss of lean body weight . The core principle of the diet is severe calorie restriction , as low as 400 calories/day , combined with supplements of minerals , vitamins and fatty acids to reduce the loss of nutrients typical of severe calorie restriction . However , experts note that some essential nutrients may still be lost , leading to potential problems such as heart arrythmias and other side effects . As a result , it is claimed that the diet in its original form has contributed to a number of deaths . '' read more here : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cambridge_Diet	?

How many agree with this ?	U2	anonymous	2007-07-25 22:05:57	Q414_R25_C5	According to the little information I know , circumcised means less friction . Guess thats why they are relating it to cutting down down . I am coming from a country with various religions . For Muslims , as well as the Jews , it is compulsory and usually it is done within a month from birth . But I remember that some Christian guys were circumcised when they are old for hygienic reasons . I do n't know what is involved in `` hygienic '' and never asked . Ladies please do not read the following story . A Christian friend of mine told me an incident that happened to his relative ( a male ) and they made fun out of it . Usually , our culture is that the girl should be virgin . SO that guy on his wedding night and while doing his `` duties '' had that `` annex '' removed due to the incident and wrong meneuvers and started bleeding . His relatives and friends started saying that instead of the bride loosing her virginity , it ended up that the groom lost his virginity . Now you can read the remaining part ladies . Regards	?

Research studies indicate that there are good medical reasons why your son should be circumcised . These include : * Circumcision substantially reduces an infant´s chances of getting a urinary tract infection ( UTI ) during the first year of his life . Although the rate of urinary tract infections for infants is not very high ( around xxx % ) , UTI´s are becoming increasingly difficult to treat ( see here for a discussion ) . * Cancer of the penis - that effects xxx men in a thousand - is essentially eliminated in circumcised males . * Research shows that males who are circumcised have a lower risk of getting sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) . In addition , partners of circumcised males are less likely to contract vaginal infections ( e.g . yeast infections ) . * Circumcision eliminates foreskin infections that occur throughout childhood . * Circumcision prevents phimosis , a narrow opening that makes it impossible to retract the foreskin at a later age . * Genital hygiene is easier after circumcision . * Circumcision virtually eliminates the accumulation of smegma .	?

Do you mean he knocked on the wrong foor and suffered some injury ? I do n't know much about circumsion . For those of us born in the United States in the 1960s it was normal procedure for all male babies and was done within days of birth . I was one of those babies and it never occurred to me to ask why it was done . In my case , not for religious reasons as I am not Muslim or Jewish . Since I have always been circumcised I do n't know what the alternative is like . Maybe the ladies have a view on this . Victory attained by violence is tantamount to a defeat , for it is momentary .

I took my daughter to her as she had a serious urine infection , the treatment she received was second to none and she was referred to a great Urologist at Al Ahli as well . You dont need a referral to see Dr pamela just phone Al Ahli hospital and go through to the appointments section ( sometimes it diverts to voicemail but go back to the Operator and they will transfer you direct to the appointments desk ) Hope this helps . know from experience what a nightmare it can be finding a really good GP out here .	?

Mandoop can guide your husband specially if your husband cant speak arabic . But still people in immigrations are all professional . They need some explaination more from your husband rather than from your mandoop . This does not mean you can get it if you go there . Sometimes you have to come not only once , twice but sometimes more than 3 times . So let your husband prepare all the papers and go by himself . Speak to higher authority and get the document signed . Hope ou can get it !	?	U19891	magnificentkid	2011-07-07 09:34:50

Then when he is coming , be sure to have an affidavit of support attested here , ( saying that you will be supporting your husband althroughout his stay in Qatar ) since it will be asked in the Philippine immigration ... and of course , he should be very familiar with your address and work here since ... again ... .it will be asked in the Philippine immig .

U2919	itsmeshanu	2010-05-22 23:05:47	Q418_R41_C5	this is a real problem , i believe . as far as I know , no accrediated university/college offers provides a 100 % distant learning bachelors degree programme . They 'd require you to study FULL-TIME or Atleast spend 2 years at the college/university . However you could get executive certificate , diploma programs etc . http : //www.u21global.edu.sg/Education/About/Offices # ua but that 'd be overly expensive , and might not be as useful for you , as for any graduate person . If you can afford to stay away from work for 2 years atleast go back to your home country to get a bachelors , or try QU/CNAQ Qatar or Dubai universities if you can afford . I hope and wish you could get scholarship . always try to treat yourself better , the way you deserve	?	U354	ntasa	2010-05-23 01:26:00

I do everything for my son , breakfast , lunch , and even wash him before I leave home . She feed him the breakfast and lunch , and changed him probably 2 times while I am away . He sleeps out of 6 hours at home 2-3 hours , so literally she stays with him awake around 3-4 hours which are great . He always sounds happy when I call to check on him . My husband also bombards her with calls asking her about our son . Our son makes noises and sings when I talk toher on the phone and even when I get home he is singing . I know them he is ok and happy . I am the one who baths him and take care of HIM when I reach home . The maid doesnt touch or seem him again until the next morning ! ! !	?

If we have debts , we are responsible to act accordingly to pay the debts , otherwise anyone can come to Qatar , borrow money , and then disappear - hmmm I do n't think so - this is a capital offence . His best bet is to check with the bank to see if they have done anything i.e . informed the police or CID otherwise there is a high risk that he will be arrested upon arrival at Doha .	?

My husband ( my sponsor ) went to the Immigration in Al Gharraga and was told to provide NOC from the previous nationality . They said no need the NOC from the embassy of the new passport . So I went to my former embassy and got the NOC . As far as I know , you will be needing the NOC together with the filled-up form ( change of nationality ) and copies of the old and new passports . We submitted all the paper works last week and told to come back in 2 weeks . You will be given a receipt that they have received the documents . By the way , the form must be filled-up and signed by your sponsor . Regards	?	U28919	Scent of a Woman	2011-04-14 18:14:18

U20588	docdsouza	2011-07-30 20:37:15	Q426_R64_C4	I will explain the insurence produre 1st . There is a government regulation that all workers irrespective of their job catogory have to pay a fee to the government something like RS . 11,000 for 2 years which includes insurence cover for any eventuallity ( House maids fee should be cheeper . you can chek that with sri lankan embassy here . if you have a problem getting info from the embassy PM me . Charge de Affairs is a personal friend of mine ) . Nodody will be allowed leave Sri Lanka without the paid stamp in their passport . They will be stopped at the airport by the officials if they do n't have that stamp . This amount shall be paid by the employee in most cases but it is up to you to negotiate that with your maid . Why do n't you send her a a contract letter and the visa document , so she 's on the safe side . So do you . She needs to sign one copy and send it back to you . yes you need to send the original of the contract attested by sri lanka embassy in qatar for her to obtain this stamp from the immigration department back in sri lanka . no stamp from the qatar embassy here on the contract means she will not be able to secure the immigration stamp in Sri Lanka .

U11136	roxi_g	2010-09-20 17:03:34	Q427_R43_C6	please take a read through this site http : //www.messybeast.com/handrear.htm I have gone through it and it gives you the info you need to hand rear this kitten . However , I must warn you , that handrearing such tiny kitten can be harrowing and success is only 20 - 40 % . Meaning , no matter how well you take care of it , death is always a nearby factor . Please do n't let it upset you or feel like you 've done something wrong if this happens . Kittens , unlike puppies are way more sensitive and require mom 's care and attention more than puppies do . Also , there is a reason that the mom left this kitten behind - she probably felt it was n't going to survive - survival of the fittest and all that ... . 1 ) Do n't feed cows milk - You will find Baby Kat milk at the vets - they will also have kit for you to feed the kitten with . 2 ) Do keep the kitten as warm as possible - they can not regulate their own body temperature - so finding a hot water bottle ( a difficult task in Doha , I have tried ) or a heating pad will work as an external source of heat - never putting the kitten directly on these items as they can scold , or electricute in the case of the heating pad . 3 ) Do make sure to keep the kittens bowels stimulated with warm damp cotton wool - this is done after the 6 feeds at 3 hourly intervals . You rub the cotton wool over the kitten 's private areas in the same manner the mom would lick the kitten to do the same . Please do read the site info I have given you , and try to find anything else useful on the internet pertaining to hand rearing kittens .	?	U245	Xena	2010-09-20 17:34:02

U11136	roxi_g	2010-09-20 17:03:34	Q427_R43_C7	I can not tell you how important it is to keep the kitten warm - use a small box , or one that will fit the hot water bottle or the heating pad , alone with a towel to cover those items - you can use a themometer and adjust the heat as described in the article I have given you . Do put a fluffy toy in with the kitten ... it wo n't feel so alone . Do n't get a fright to , if the kitten starts to deficate on its own inside its bed , this will happen too , but do n't forget to stimulate it too . A kitten should urinate often , but in my experience , they only deficate 1 time a day , 2 times at the most in the first 1/2 weeks ... there after it becomes more frequent .	?

There have in the past been instances of people arriving without documents . The penalties for employing someone without the correct paperwork will be heavy .

Tepgam67 is asking about Work permit while being on Family visa . shapil is talking about residence permit . that 's what happens when unprofessional people try to give an advice . Tepgam67 , if you have an RP here , to obtain a Work permit you need police clearance and the contract certified in MOL . How long it takes to finalize the process depends on several factors . ometimes it takes 3-4 days , sometimes it takes 1 month and even more . If you do n't have an RP here ( i.e . you are on 6 months family visa ) , you can not work , and therefore you can not obtain a Work permit .	?	U77	qatarisun	2010-07-04 22:49:59

Based on your Work VISA you got your RP . You do n't need an additional work PERMIT , since your visa is a WORK visa . Clear ? Work PERMIT is required for those who are on the Family Visa and wish to work . The author of this thread is on Family Visa and already has her RP , I guess . She might stay in Qatar on Family visa without working ( while you can not stay on Work visa without working ) . But now she has chosen to work .

It was returned to me unprocessed because Qatar Embassy requires my passport to be authenticated ( maybe because it is old-type GREEN passport , though it will expire in 2015 . Since the authentication will take 1 month to process ( as informed to me by DFA ) , I decided to renew my passport instead . The problem is my renewed passport no . ( maroon passport ) will not be the same with my passport no . indicated in my VISA ( green passport ) . What should I do ? Would the Embassy still visa-stamp on my new passport ?	?

U753	Minoush	2011-01-13 19:09:47	Q432_R101_C6	Minoush , make sure you have a spare tire and then if you get a flat just pull over and either look helpless or change to the spare yourself . Then drive to one of the many garages and they will patch your flat in no time for 15 QAR . Also , for a breakdown , see if your auto dealer/service center has roadside service . Mine , Al Fardan , does . But once when I came to a dead stop ( for no apparent reason ) at one of the traffic lights on Al Sadd Rd ( I forget the cross street now ) it took the guy 2 hours to find me . Mandi	?

I must say , some of the houses around look quite big . The one that i am talking about has 3 beds 2 baths plus another toilet . I also noticed quite a few that had large walls are a gate around them them . One set had a few villas in and a big gate to go into . Not sure yet which is the one for rent .	?

U1855	nottoknow	2007-04-03 10:26:58	Q434_R31_C8	Since you understand Jaidah flyover , this is the direction to Bonanza ( the best place for quality taste but down market for `` treat '' ) . Leave the Jaidah flyover while driving from Ramada and take a U-turn below the flyover . Then turn first right inside-that area is bin Mehmoud . Cross first red light straight and 5 shops before the next signal on the right is Bonanza . Today a new Vegetarian restaurant called Vasant Bhawan is opened on the Crazy signal in Aljazeera Appartments building . This could be worth a try . Quiet lurker . Poor Contributer	?

But in Qatar , it is not worth the huge expense of getting a dried out , underbred , withered and scrawny wooden tree . Btw , Home Center in the City Centre Mall now has x3 varieties of trees ( including full size ) , as well as many decorations .

U63052	dohadiet	2012-02-20 14:56:01	Q436_R19_C5	The only way to lose weight and maintain it is by changing your eating/training/sleeping lifestyle for ever . IF not , you will always gain more weight than what you lost and this is why people who diet a lot tend to get fatter as they age . It is not a temporary thing . It is a lifestyle change . So , you need to not deprive yourself completely for everything you like at once . msg me if you need any help . I know a lot about this topic and I have helped many others get to their goals .	?

I have started doing it again as it gets cooler , not so much because I want to lose weight but because it makes me feel wonderful . Wow , with two little ones no wonder you do n't find the times to look after your diet . Maybe try not to skip meals , but instead doing big meals eat little things often just to speed up your metabolism ? Yup , I 'm skinny now , I 'm happiest with my body when I 'm between 50 and 55 kg .

Last winter it was easy to go for brisk walks ... you know , sit her on her stroller and just push her and run up and down the corniche ... she would be asleep within ten minutes . But now she insists in getting out of the pushchair and walking as well so is a little bit more difficult ! . Maybe the weith you put on during the second pregnancy takes a little bit longer to come off . Maybe you are holding onto some fat while you are still breastfeeding and it will come off once you wean your baby , I heard that happens often . Anyways 3 kg in four months sounds fine , pregnancy weight always take longer to get rid of , just keep your diet and work outs and go for walks whenever you can and I 'm sure you will slim down : )	?

What you eat - energy you consume = net fat gain/loss . You either eat less or use up more energy . There is no magic potion , pill or diet . You have to make a lifestyle change . Small changes in lifestyle ( substituting skimmed for full fat milk , avoiding fried food etc etc ) will mean a gradual weight loss but its more likely to become permenant . Other helpful hints include increasing muscle mass to increase metabolism and eating most of your calories early on in the day . No night binging .	?	U17836	dr evil	2006-10-07 14:44:36

Try giving her water everytime she wakes up . Otherwise , horrible as it sounds , maybe you can just let her cry it out . 1 year babies know how to use crying not to only to communicate basic needs but just to get some attention . Perhaps if you ignore it for a couple of nights , she will learn that crying at night will not get her what she wants ( your attention ) and realise that nights are for sleeping . hope it helps	?

Cutting out carbs is one way to reduce your caloric intake ( like the atkins diet ) ... .but unless its a permanent change ( ie lifestyle change and not just a diet for a certain period ) , the weight tends to return . Generally speaking ( unless there are medical reasons mostly to do with metabolism ) , a person 's weight is a function of how many calories they itake , and how many they work off ( by exercising ) ... .and exercising does n't JUST mean the gym ... . The best Advice I can give you is not to follow a pre printed diet , but go to a nutritionist who can tailor a diet for your specific body type and needs ... at least that 's what I would do in Canada ... .I do n't even know if there are certified nutritionists in Qatar . Hope that helps ... and whatever you decide , good luck . Stay safe . Perfection does not exist . The question therefore , is : what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for ?	?

U2296	buttercupryle	2007-11-14 08:20:51	Q436_R32_C10	everyone is differant , but to lose weight it has to be a lifstyle change as once you go of the diet you can actually put more weight back on eat sesable and exersise . A doctor once told me try to avoid worring about actually how much you weigh and go for apperance . following a low carb diet works you mainly limit the intake of what are known to be BAD carbs things like to much rice , pasta , bread dont forget there are good carbs and you need these when you exersice to help develop mussle i suggest eating a bannana before exersiceing as this gives you energy as well as helps with the fat burning procces . when switching from a poor diet to a more structured one try taking a good multi vitamin just to help kick start everything again . Also try just changing eating habits make sure you eat a good breakfast and switch your main meal to the middle of the day as thats when we require the most energy also try not to eat more than 2-3 hours before bed .	?

No nonsens guy and will advise you what to do . His clinic is just next to Midmac on the side where they are braking up the road . So if you are at Midmac , go towards the Amiri road that is broken up , do the U turn and come back to Midmac . His building is the last one on your right . No appointment needed . He is the best . Go to him and ask him . Aisha-Taweela	?	U427	Aisha-Taweela	2009-02-17 13:06:49

Amoud - He was born with big tonsils but his pediatrician had said to leave it alone , but about a 2yr back he was diagnosed with ragweed allergy , whihc back in canada would start around spring and last till fall , and soon after that he started to snore at night , so he was sent to ENT who said its his Adenoids that are large and while they are removing that they will also remove the tonsils , but after moving to Doha last summeer he quit snoring and came back in winter , so i personally think its allregy of somesort that triggers the adenoids to become large , so I am hoping to consult few good ENT and pediatrician to get thier opinion and go from there on .	?

I dont have a lot of faith in Drs . here , you get some great ones at times but I am not sure about them when it comes to cutting my kids . I waited to get some stuff done when I went back to Canada for vacation . Even for myself , I contacted my Dr. by email and as he knew my history etc and what I wanted done I scheduled the procedure before I came ( although I ended up paying but at least you know you are in good hands ) . ____________________________________________________ `` Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers ''	?

However , i think there 's some sort of psychological effect with the kids . Just like what I 've seen in Dr. Phil . It makes little girls obsessed with make-ups , clothes , shoes , bags and the list goes on . And the worst effect is the kids feels like they should always look skinny . And its really bad for their health . cheers , paul	?	U348	who.am.i	2008-12-03 00:39:10

Read thoroughly the clauses especially the `` Termination of Contract '' . In normal course , either party can terminate the contract with 1 to 7days notice subject to the terms and conditions specified on the contract . If you terminate the contract within the probation period , you will have to pay a lump sum amount to the employer towards the cost of visa , medical , and other expenses if any . Also you will have to buy the ticket from your pocket . However the employer has no right to hold u back but can ban you for 2 years without providing an NOC . So think twice ... gud luck ...	?

The most important thing here is sincerity , and I hope the family problem you are mentioning is real . I read some of your past comments on some threads and I 'm really having a second thought about your real intention . Actually , it should have been a different story if you had not submitted a resignation letter but since you have already , my advice is , if you are still within the probationary period , submit a letter of termination for your contract or submit an irrevocable resignation stating your reasons . Then study the Qatar Labor Law as to what are the consequences of such actions . But do not abscond but wait 'til they accept your letter . MAke sure you have a receipt copy of your letter bearing the date it was pass and received by the company !	?	U56	flor1212	2010-08-29 12:20:01

Saeedkan is correct , your boss finds you suitable for your job , that is why he is having a hard time , or even already decided to keep you within the company . I can suggest , apply for an EMERGENCY LEAVE , that way at least , you can assure your boss that you are coming back . Once in the Philippines , way all your options and decide if you are coming back or not , but still THE BEST WAY IS TO COME BACK , of course , for you and for your family 's good . Definitely , your boss wants to keep you , so the best way is to assure him your coming back . In that way he will have peace and no worries .	?	U2870	lyndon_joseph	2010-08-29 12:34:24

Obviously these companies have separate organized daycare places it 's not like bring your kid to office day ... We have some companies like that in Morocco and I 'm thinking there must be some in here as well Boxbe I respect your point of view but I totally disagree with it , daycare can only help reduce the stress level for working moms ( and some dads whom care enough ) , just like having a staff lounge or a gym . It ll mak business a little more human I do n't see why it should reflect any negativity on its image . Unless you think a woman 's place is at home etc ... then I wo n't debate it .

Not everyone see it as a way to get rid of their own kids . It is a way safer way to return to work rather that maids . I have seen horrors in some nurseries which were not cheap at all so I would n't put my children in there for anything in this world . So yeah mothers might need help with the kids but it does n't make us unfit it just makes us human . Molten I have made the choice to be at home since I had my first son and I thought I would do it again . 2 twins later i 'm being outnumbered by babies even with a maid and let 's face it money is gona be a major issue soon . bringing my mom was temporary and expensive ... we are expats there is no cousins sisters around ... so we need a permanent solution . i should say my elder ( 1.5 yr ) enjoys other toddlers company so it ll be a great way for him to socialize.. the high heels noise is a good point though	?

That 's the mentality in this country . You can tell by the way the kids behave in the malls ! Unfortunately Samia most of the people in this country still believe that a woman should be in the home cooking and cleaning , and sadly they actually do n't even know what a workplace childcare facility would mean . They come from countries with , umm , different , values .	?	U955	fubar	2014-05-15 11:48:23

Do ask to see their Ministry registration . Outside of this there is the home provision by employing a Nanny , which is a costly activity initially . There is also many who will offer the service privately unregulated . Its your choice who you trust this small child with . Child care should be planned proir to the babys birth . we have nine months to plan for this day and children deserve the best decisions from us . check Doha Mums website . good Luck .	?

People are spoilt here with having private insurance and do n't know how good the local services are . Why pay for a private clinic. ? All they are interested in is making profit . Go to the government run clinics and everything is subsidised by the government here . Money is no object ! You get the best . I have had two major operations done here in Hamad hospital . I have been going to a local clinic for 12 years and had excellent care . They refer you straight to a specialist if they suspect anything wrong . I have had in the last month a colonoscopy , and endoscopy , seen a heart specialist and had a complete medical to check there is nothing going on that could cause future problems . All because I am over 50 and these checks can save lives in the future . Excellent care here . This would never happen in the UK . You would be on a wait list for a year at least to just see one specialist and have one procedure . Each procedure , done under sedation only cost me Qr75 . For a paltry sum of Qr100 I recommend the health care in Qatar . Of course you wait a little when you go for your check up . Not like the private hospitals , but for the standard of care here it 's well worth it .	?	U1786	Stevanlea	2012-08-06 08:59:34

Abu Dhabi is booming , a couple of months away and I do n't recognize new roads or buildings anymore . Qatar is now falling 10 years behind the UAE in every passing year . You can go to the UAE even if you are banned in Qatar . Send all these slavedriving sponsors to hell and let them do their work themselves ! ! ! Good luck !	?	U10	Alumnar	2010-11-24 17:22:32

U3634	johnjo	2008-10-15 13:10:37	Q447_R106_C4	the cost of living is very high . And yes , accommodation is steep ! my husband and I stayed there for 2 years , and we were n't able to save much . but transport system is the best -- you will hardly feel the need for a car : P sights and tourist spots are incomparable ; shopping is amazing -- all the big brands are there -- a bit expensive though ; food selection is wide and soo yummy : ) As far as I remember , income tax for expats is around 15 % per month . But at the end of the year , all the tax you paid will be given back to you , and you just pay the government 15 % of that amount . That why we looove tax filing season in Singapore , like the months of May to June , because you get back all the tax you paid so it feels like Xmas bonus that time of the year . And you remit only 15 % of that to the government : D ***lucky*wifey***	?	U4721	starry_eyed	2008-10-15 13:41:33

I spent 15 years with the old ( Qatar General Petroleum Corporation ... now QP and that covers the entire oil/gas sector ) and yes there are ups and downs . Social provisions ( Company facilities ) have deteriorated over the years but the developments in Qatar have probably made up for that . Another plus is that the country is now far more tolerant of Western behaviour and habits . Be warned about the housing costs . QP at one time provided free housing and utilities ( including phone line rental ) . They then applied a limit to electricity and water useage after which you pay and I 'm not sure if they pay for the phone line now ( unless it 's required for the job ) . If housing is provided I suggest that you take it . You will see from other posts how the cost of housing has risen . Ask QP all the questions to which you require answers . Whatever you decide to do ... ... ... . good luck .	?	U178	dweller	2006-03-27 08:24:33

The HR department of the company you are planning to join ? This is weird . Normally it takes up to 14 days for the CID , and then 1 week for the Labour Department and another week for the Immigration department . 7 weeks is a bit too long so you 'd better check with the comapany you are planning to go to and ask them what is going on with your paperwork . Mine was rejected once and took less than that .	?	U4124	yacine.h	2014-09-13 23:29:35

Since the company I am joining is not meeting its target , the Ministry of Labour decided to block most of its overseas hiring , therefore mine was blocked . It took them around 9 days to issue the rejection , and then 4 more days to change their mind when my company submitted a letter inviting them to review the situation . What I would say is that your application is stuck with the CID normally . It might take them few more days to process your papers . In the meantime ask your company if this is normal . If they tell you this is fine you do not need to worry about it then it is fine . The only problem would be to manage your situation financially during this time , as I assume you are now paying your own rent .	?	U4124	yacine.h	2014-09-14 04:52:05

They would have to sit on that bus going around the houses having probably woken up about 5am in the morning ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Then of course they would have the same long and tedious journey home ! ! ! ! ! ! If they car in a private car the journey takes takes only 35 mins ! Now tell me what would you choose , bus or car ? ? ? Alot of employees are also given their accommodation and are unable to live near the school and this in turn increases the volume of traffic on the roads . We could also ask , why are so many schools built next to each other . It is not unusual to see 6 schools built right next to each other and drop off and pick up is nothing short of a nightmare .

I have invited my sister to visit us in Doha in January . I have n't booked her flight yet and know that we can obtain a 14 day visitor 's visa for her on arrival at DIA . My question is this . If she would like to stay for , say , 3 weeks and so I book a return flight for that duration , what happens at DIA when she arrives with a return ticket dated 3 weeks after her arrival ? I can see from QHell 's post that it should n't be a problem to extend her Visa at the Airport AFTER her arrival but , if immigration see her visit is for THREE weeks , will they still issue her with a TWO week visa irrespective of what her ticket says ? Grateful to anyone who may have the answer to this . QHell ? What was the duration of YOUR visitor 's return flight ticket , please . I guess it was for a stay longer than 2 weeks , otherwise you would n't have wanted to extend the Visa . [ img_assist|nid=57285|title=|desc=|link=none|align=right|width=|height=0 ]	?

Q454_R31	Qatar Living Lounge	How to extend visitor visa ?	What is the procedure to extend a 14 days visitor visa to 28 days ?

Thanks in advance .	U2007	QHell	2007-11-26 09:07:46	Q454_R31_C8	Are you talking about the visa or my sister 's air ticket ? I will purchase her ticket before we leave the UK and I 'm trying to find out if it 's OK to book her for a 3 week return ticket . It 's my understanding that you can only get a Visa for 14 days on arrival , but then extend it later if you want to . What I 'm asking is if it 's OK to book her ticket for a 3-week return , even though the Visa will be for 14 days ( initially ) . Will immigration query her ticket . Do you see what I mean ? lol OH ! And if you DO mean the ticket , then it would cost me a LOT more than QR100-200 to change the return date . I buy the cheapest ticket I can and those are n't 'changeable ' unless you pay a lot of money to do so . [ img_assist|nid=57285|title=|desc=|link=none|align=right|width=|height=0 ]	?

Even though I told them I was here for 2 weeks holiday and my ticket had the return date on , each time at the airpot they automatically gave me a month visa . One of the times my Mum was with me & they also gave her a 1 month visa . So I would presure that they will automatically give your sister the same . Unless anyone else know different .

First 1/2 kg costs you 8 dollars and it is 5.50 for each additional 1/2kg . Mind you , when it comes from US , the weight will be in pounds , so how they calculate the charge , beats me . The fact is that I have never paid more than 70 reals for my purchases from Amazon.com . Be careful , though , do n't get your mailbox address on a junk mailing list , otherwise you will end up paying 8 dollars per each crappy catalogue or leaflet which will come on your name . I buy everything from Amazon.com ( and most of the companies do sell through amazon.com ) and nothing happened so far . Timewise it takes the package approximately 3-4 ( rarely more than that ) days to get to Doha , from the moment it arrives in your mailbox in US . UK takes 1-2 days . So far I am very happy with their service . My only complain is that they do n't deliver , you have to go and fetch it yourself . But they do send you SMS , and there is tracking of items in your mailbox online . Check them at www.aramex.com/shopandship/ There is one more service www.ushopweship.com Supposedly they filter junk mail , but being happy with Aramex I have never tried them .	?

As mine were books and non-medical or food related that had nothing to do with the delay . Someone suggested that ( a ) the inspector ( as in only one ) was on holiday or that ( b ) a new competitor with more wasta was able to delay the shipment . I do n't believe either . But it was very frustrating waiting for it to be cleared when it normally takes about 5 - 10 days from the time I order for it to be available to be picked up .	?

Yeah , I think stress adds more to her problem that 's why I told her that she must not think about the pimple problem because it will only add up . She also mentioned about the water in qatar , she said it 's a bit different of what we have here in the Philippines . Whenever she takes a facial wash , she uses boiled water ( cooled of course ) for rinsing . The cosmetics that I would send her is recommended by a dermatologist , but unfortunately , our government wo n't allow it . @ kiarajane are you filipina ? it looks like you 're filipina because you know RDL , and Liwanag is a Filipino word ... anyways , thanks for the reply ...

Qatar is an Islamic country and they do not allow such things here that is why medicines are not sold here . I do remember that they stopped selling such medicines in the begining of 1980 . I know that in most of the countries you will get some medicines for bringing back the mestural cycle if you are in doubt of pregnancy in the very early stage .

When we drove back to Qatar , I was expecting to be collared at the border but nothing was said . So my question is this : Have I got away with it or not ? I hope the UAE traffic fines are not linked to Qatar MOI ? But what if we ever go back to the UAE - will we be fined then ? Or what about transiting through Dubai airport ? Looking forward to hearing any help with this .	U68500	cessna152	2010-06-01 09:32:29	Q458_R34_C8	You will get them here ...	?	U405	bleu	2010-06-01 10:46:05

It has both the regular courts and the sharia courts . For estafa or deceit , it is normally filed with a complaint with the prosecutor and after preliminary investigation , it will be filed with the Court of First Instance . You need not hire a lawyer since the prosecutor will be your lawyer . But bear in mind to produce evidence on estafa or deceit . If you have no documentary exhibits forget your complaint and charge it to experience . Sharia courts handle family relations law and criminal cases involving Qataris and muslim litigants . Cases involving foreigners , civil or criminal are handled by regular courts .	?	U7583	rimlaw	2009-01-03 23:16:39

The rejoinder of qatarisun is well taken , your respondent can easily deny having received money from you or simply say that the money is simple loan , and you have no case for estafa .

You guys want to be paid for a good job done , so do the dentists . Your teeth are an important part of your well being . So you should get the best . There are several dentists that do a good job , which includes Dr Sarrah 's clinic . They use the right materials and do the right procedures . Ofcourse you can try a CHEAP place but remember , they are taking shortcuts some where ... ..and in the end you are paying for it . I was discussing with my dentist the fact that there were so many new dental clinics opening all over Doha and if this was a worry to him . He said that no way , he was not worried at all cos he said that he had heard from the medical rep that the first questions these new clinics were asking : `` What is the cheapest we can buy ? '' This was in relation to equipment and materials ... ..so ... ... do you want the cheapeststuff used on you ? No not me , I rather go to a reputable dentist and get a good job/treatment . However the choice is your . And by the way I am not a patient of Dr Sarrah , but I know she is good , cos the good dentists hang around together and discuss cases . And Dr Sarrah is highly talked about by my own dentist . Aisha-Taweela	?	U427	Aisha-Taweela	2008-04-16 14:41:27

U5140	doha_astig	2008-04-16 13:39:18	Q460_R30_C10	i got mine at Doha Specialized Dental Center located at al-mountazah street , beside minitery of mosque affairs.. they got the most reasonable price.. go there and make an appointment . and they charge only QR50 for check up.. isnt that cheap ? ? some clinics charged QR150 or more ... the fee for the braces though depends on each cases.. mine was so cheap for a 1.5 months pay..	?

You 'll notice the difference from how they are packed . US versions have free games and the package is black , while asian version are somewhat ash and no free games , just the console and are 220v . About the NTSC or PAL . You really dont have to worry about it because newer TV systems Support both PAL and NTSC systems . If you have an HDTV in uk , then you got no problems at all . *unless you got those really-really old school TVs .	?	U3892	marXus	2008-04-11 21:00:35
Q461_R95	Doha Shopping	PS3 Qatar/UK	Hi all , I am new here but was looking for some advice . I have decided that I am going to buy the PS3 but I am going to return to the UK in the near future and I was wondering if anyone could tell me whether it would work with UK games/tvs/power supply etc ? Also , I 'm thinking of buying it at Virgin in Villagio ... Any other good places to buy ? Any help greatly appreciated .

But dont worry , I suggest you buy a separate Power Supply for your PS3 which would likely be 110v if you 're taking the US version PS3 . Power Supplies are like boxes , like the ones you see under computers . Computers need a separate Power Supply . They both got 220v and 110v . Make sure its 110v if you 're going to plug it in 110v , DONT plug the US version ps3 in 220v , or else you 'll get a brand new 500 $ Paper Weight .	?	U3892	marXus	2008-04-11 21:28:31

Having said that , i think there are DVD movie restrictions . The PS3 's voltage does n't matter either because they have built in regulators . I myself have a white Japanese PS3 ( bought in Qatar ) and it works perfectly find with everything . Just make sure you buy an HD cable if you have an HD tv since PS3 's do n't come with that . The Middle East 's standard system is PAL . However you can get NTSC-J NTSC-UC and PAL all over in stores . I recommend the NTSC-UC ( US , for movies because they come out later ) . At the end of the day it does n't really matter what you get . ___________________________ Click here for LOADS of Qatar info I♥Q & lt ; -- ( Expat and Local Info )	?	U1248	whoami	2008-04-12 07:46:32

Obviously the Light version has restrictions , which the Premium version does not . Once you install and run it , the mobile phone will connect to the interent using the phone 's data connection . You then connect the laptop and you 're on line . THe problem you may have , if it is a company mobile , there may be restrictions on the handset allowing interent connectivity .

U16375	katuks	2006-10-06 11:32:30	Q463_R101_C1	Hi , A friend of mine told me following : I 've been in Doha since 98 . I was employed in Ras Gas for 3 years as a contractor . They have a good package for new direct employees . The housing is situated in Al Khor ( 70 km from Doha ) they provide schooling in their complex . As a company Ras Gas are one of the main employeers in Ras Laffan . They are present extending their trains to 6 which will increase their production facilities . If your wife can drive its fine , as there is not a lot in Al Khor ( no shopping malls , big super markets etc.. ) . It takes at least 1 hour to drive to Doha . Are you already in Doha or not ?	?

Its the best company here in Qatar and they have all facilities . The accomodation complex is excellent and have all the features required . Yes , its a bit far from the Doha city . But that shouldnt be a problem . Nowadays Ras Gas are shifting some of their personnel to stay in Doha . Maybe after a few years you would be the lucky one . So dont think twice . Go ahead and do your planning to join the company . When the package is excellent , nothing to worry . Cheers ... Bobby	?	U88	bob1972	2006-10-08 07:51:35

U16375	katuks	2006-10-06 11:32:30	Q463_R101_C9	Hi SloopJohnD , I have only lived here for a few weeks but will happily offer my humble opinion . I work on the Ras Laffan idustrial estate but not for QatarGas , so I cant give any opinions on QatarGas . It is based very near my company so the commute would be very similar - its not so bad , most of the way is easy - virtually the same road ! Doha is the hardest part ... the driving is crazy . With a family it is defitiely better to be living in Doha , everything you need is there and you can enjoy a good standard of living , all the schools are there too i think . The people seem ok , crime is very low and you never feel like you would walking the streets in other cities . There are lots of activities all over and if you join a club like the doha club or something you can get family membership . I cant speak for the heat in summer but I would imagine its quite unbearable - but with air con etc it should be fine - and the winter weather is meant to be glorious . There is a book which I got from amazon that came in useful called Qatar - the complete residents guide - that will give you lots of info and really is worth the money . One point which I didnt know is that you can upgrade your driving licence ( in the uk anyway ) for free to an international driving licence-you need to do it before you arrive . I dont know if you can email me or whatever for more advice but I would be happy to answer any questions . Doha is a good place to live and much better than anywhere near Ras Laffan , theres realy not alot there . Anyway , hope this helps . McSunny	?	U825	McSunny	2006-10-12 16:53:33

U16375	katuks	2006-10-06 11:32:30	Q463_R101_C10	Hi . Thought I would give you my two cents worth . My husband had been driving back and forth to Ras Laffan for 8 months . He come to hate the drive ! Although it is an easy ride once outside of city , straight highway driving . The drive takes between 45-60 minutes , depending on traffic of course . We moved to the new Dolphin Energy compound and really are enjoying it . Doha is close enough when we want to go into the city to do whatever . Compound life is awesome ! Beautiful homes , almost like a small town within the compound ! As for children well our youngest is 18 and they are living in Canada , so we did n't have to factor that into the move . However , I would think that compound living with children would be fine too . Certainly would not have to worry about day to day things that you would in a city . Hope this helped somewhat .	?

That is correct , the new buyer has to be present with the seller as he is required to sign a document . He also needs a NOC from his company . In my case as I am leaving Qatar before the new buyer returns from vacation , the police have said that I can sign the document and leave it with the duty officer . On the return of the new buyer from vacation , he will just provide the NOC , produce all his QID , drivers license and the transfer will take place although I wo n't be in Qatar .

You must get your blood group changed in ID immediately , Inform your company HR or go to MOI office . Before going get another blood group test done at any clinic for 15 QR & present your report to concerned authority . Correcting the mistakes is for your own safety .	?

This can cause a problem only in emergencies , where they have to check your ID to know your blood group , so they can give you proper blood unit . Since you are O+ , then you should n't get any other group than O because it can be fatal . So please , do n't leave it like that .	?	U5910	Basil_qatar	2014-09-21 14:14:14

It consists of 11 grades . I do n't know the whole structure but understand that 8-11 are managerial grades . I also received an offer from them ( we may joined the same interview section in Central ... ) . Their offer letter did n't say much background details and I kept clarifying with them . Suggest that you do the same to clear your concerns . P.S . : Personal thought is that you can definitely find a job with a more decent salary package than this in HK now . Job market here is good ( from job seekers ' side ) . Take care . F'co a little progress everyday adds up to big results	?	U704	Think-Twice	2007-06-25 16:03:24

Q471_R53	Salary and Allowances	Offer by Qatar Airline	Hi everyone , I am from Hong Kong , and I had recently offered by Qatar Airline for the position of Senior Airport Services Agent .

I need to reply to them by next week , but I still have chance getting into other airlines in Hong Kong . Do u think the basic Salary are enough for living in QATAR ? ? PLS Help Me ! ! !

You can easily find a job in HK with more than HKD10000 nowadays , esp with degree . Either ask for more or stay in HK , unless you are really attracted about the Middle East . All the best . F'co . a little progress everyday adds up to big results	?	U704	Think-Twice	2007-06-27 17:20:56
Q472_R30	Visas and Permits	Difference bet.cancelled & work visa expired ?	My Pataka/work permit is expired last June 7 and with the grace period of 3 months it will be expired again on September 7 . My company seems so slow in renewing it . If they will not be able to renew it b4 Sept. 7 is it considered cancelled ? or just an expired work visa only ? If i go out of Qatar can i come back after sept. 7 with that expired visa ? Is an NOC still needed if i will apply for new job here the mere fact that i was not cancelled ? So confusing ... need ur thoughts here ...	U167	robherr soft	2012-08-05 10:45:42	Q472_R30_C1	Your bataka is already expired on 7th June . Yes 3 month grace period after which not renewed there will be fine . it will not be cancelled until and unless you permanently leave qatar , instead you will end up or your company will end up paying fine for the expiry . So let them renew it as soon as possible . however if can only be cancelled until and unless your company cancels it and your ban for 2 years . Yes noc is required if your company is willing to give . In your situation since they are delaying for RP , i doubt they would even give an NOC .	?	U2	anonymous	2012-08-05 10:52:13
