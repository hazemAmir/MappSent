U2919	itsmeshanu	2010-05-22 23:05:47	Q418_R41_C5	this be a real problem , i believe . as far a i know , no accrediated university/college offer provide a 100 % distant learning bachelor degree programme . they 'd require you to study full-time or atleast spend 2 year at the college/university . however you could get executive certificate , diploma program etc . http : //www.u21global.edu.sg/education/about/offices # ua but that 'd be overly expensive , and might not be a useful for you , a for any graduate person . if you can afford to stay away from work for 2 year atleast go back to your home country to get a bachelor , or try qu/cnaq qatar or dubai university if you can afford . i hope and wish you could get scholarship . always try to treat yourself good , the way you deserve	?

U16375	katuks	2006-10-06 11:32:30	Q463_R101_C9	hi sloopjohnd , i have only live here for a few week but will happily offer my humble opinion . i work on the ras laffan idustrial estate but not for qatargas , so i cant give any opinion on qatargas . it be base very near my company so the commute would be very similar - it not so bad , most of the way be easy - virtually the same road ! doha be the hard part ... the driving be crazy . with a family it be defitiely well to be live in doha , everything you need be there and you can enjoy a good standard of living , all the school be there too i think . the people seem ok , crime be very low and you never feel like you would walk the street in other city . there be lot of activity all over and if you join a club like the doha club or something you can get family membership . i cant speak for the heat in summer but i would imagine it quite unbearable - but with air con etc it should be fine - and the winter weather be mean to be glorious . there be a book which i get from amazon that come in useful call qatar - the complete resident guide - that will give you lot of info and really be worth the money . one point which i didnt know be that you can upgrade your drive licence ( in the uk anyway ) for free to an international driving licence-you need to do it before you arrive . i dont know if you can email me or whatever for more advice but i would be happy to answer any question . doha be a good place to live and much good than anywhere near ras laffan , theres realy not alot there . anyway , hope this help . mcsunny	?
